HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of the Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma and of the Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy, whereas, HTLV-2 infection has not been formally associated with any T-cell malignancy. HTLV-1 and 2 genomes encode, respectively, the Tax1 and Tax2 proteins whose role is to transactivate the viral promoter. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Tax sequences display 28% divergence at the amino acid level. Tax1 is a shuttling protein that possesses both a non canonical nuclear import (NLS) and a nuclear export (NES) signal. We have recently demonstrated that Tax1 and Tax2 display different subcellular localization and that residues 90-100 are critical for this process. We investigate in the present report, whether Tax2 also possesses a functional NES. RESULTS: We first used a NES prediction method to determine whether the Tax2 protein might contain a NES and the results do suggest the presence of a NES sequence in Tax2. Using Green Fluorescent Protein-NES (GFP-NES) fusion proteins, we demonstrate that the Tax2 sequence encompasses a functional NES (NES2). As shown by microscope imaging, NES2 is able to mediate translocation of GFP from the nucleus, without the context of a full length Tax protein. Furthermore, point mutations or leptomycin B treatment abrogate NES2 function. However, within the context of full length Tax2, similar point mutations in the NES2 leucine rich stretch do not modify Tax2 localization. Finally, we also show that Tax1 NES function is dependent upon the positioning of the nuclear export signal ""vis-a-vis"" GFP. CONCLUSION: HTLV-2 Tax NES is functional but dispensable for the protein localization in vitro.","['Chevalier, Sebastien A', 'Meertens, Laurent', 'Calattini, Sara', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Kiemer, Lars', 'Mahieux, Renaud']","['Chevalier SA', 'Meertens L', 'Calattini S', 'Gessain A', 'Kiemer L', 'Mahieux R']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. schevali@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/physiology', 'Leucine', '*Nuclear Export Signals', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/physiology']",2005/11/16 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-70 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-70 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 Nov 14;2:70. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-70.,20051114,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",PMC1308865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demographic trends are magnifying this concern -- an ageing population will require more medical interventions at a time when the HHR workforce itself is ageing. The lengthy and costly training period for most health care workers, especially physicians, poses a real challenge that requires planning these activities well in advance. Hence, there is definite need for a good HHR forecasting model. OBJECTIVES: To present a physician forecasting model that projects the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) demand for and supply of physicians in Nova Scotia to the year 2020 for three specialties: general practitioners, medical, and surgical. The model enables gap analysis and assessment of alternative policy options designed to close the gaps. METHODOLOGY: The methodology for estimating demand fo physician services involves three steps: (i) Establishing the FT for each physician. To this end we calculate the income of each physician using Physician Billings Data and then identify the 40th and 60th percentile income levels for each of the 40 specialties. The income levels are then used to calculate the FTE using a formula developed at Health Canada; (ii) Calculating the FTE for each service by distributing the FTE of each physician at the service level (i.e., by patient age, sex, most responsible diagnosis, and hospital status group); and (iii) Using Statistics Canada's population projections to project future demand for three broad medical disciplines: general practitioners, medical specialist, and surgical specialists. The supply side of the model employs a stock/flow approach and exploits time-series and other data for variables, such as emigration, international medical graduates (IMGs), medical school entrants, retirements, mortality, and so on, which in turn allow us to access a host of policy parameters. RESULTS: Under the status quo assumption, demand for physician services will outstrip the growth in supply for all three specialties. CONCLUSIONS: The model can simulate supply-side policy changes (e.g. more IMGs, delayed retirements) and can also reflect changes in demand (e.g. a cure for leukemia; different work intensities for physicians). The model is highly parameterized so that it can accommodate shocks that may influence the future requirements for physicians. Once a future requirement is determined, the supply model can identify the policy levers (new entrants, immigration, emigration, retirement) necessary to close the gap between demand and supply. The model is a user-friendly tool made for policy makers to formulate appropriate physician workforce planning.","['Basu, Kisalaya', 'Gupta, Anil']","['Basu K', 'Gupta A']","[""Economiste principal, Division de la modelisation par microsimulation de l'analyse des donnees, Direction de la recherche appliquee et de l'analyse, Ministere de la Sante, Canada.""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Cah Sociol Demogr Med,Cahiers de sociologie et de demographie medicales,0004455,IM,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Economics, Medical', 'Emigration and Immigration', 'Family Practice/economics', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Foreign Medical Graduates', 'General Surgery/economics', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Health Workforce', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Nova Scotia', 'Physicians/*supply & distribution', 'Population Growth', 'Retirement', 'Specialization']",2005/11/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/16 09:00'],"['2005/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cah Sociol Demogr Med. 2005 Apr-Sep;45(2-3):255-85.,,,,,Un modele previsionnel de l'offre et de la demande de medecins dans la province Canadienne de la Nouvelle-Ecosse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors conducted a Phase II study, in which rituximab was added to fludarabine for patients with symptomatic, untreated CLL, to evaluate clinical outcomes. Sixty patients with B-CLL received 6 monthly courses of fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) for 5 days) followed by 4 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: On the basis of National Cancer Institute criteria, 47 of 60 patients (78%) achieved a complete remission, 9 of 60 patients (15%) achieved a partial remission, and 4 of 60 patients (7%) had no response or progressive disease. It is noteworthy that the patients experienced a long progression-free survival (PFS) from treatment (68% at 3 yrs).

The 5-year OS rate for Arm A was 52.4%, and 58.4% for Arm B (P = 0.599). The 5-year DFS rate for the patients who achieved CR was 35.8% in Arm A and 30.4% in Arm B (P = 0.543). In analyzing the data according to the risk groups, no statistical difference was observed either in the 5-year OS rate or in the 5-year DFS rate between the 2 arms. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group's conventional postremission therapy (three courses of standard-dose consolidation and six courses of maintenance therapy) was replaced successfully by a shorter duration of four courses of standard-dose consolidation therapy without the need for additional maintenance therapy.","['Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Yagasaki, Fumiharu', 'Mitani, Kinuko', 'Matsuda, Shin', 'Kishimoto, Yuji', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Matsushima, Takafumi', 'Takahashi, Masatomo', 'Ogawa, Yoshiaki', 'Honda, Sumihisa', 'Ohno, Ryuzo']","['Miyawaki S', 'Sakamaki H', 'Ohtake S', 'Emi N', 'Yagasaki F', 'Mitani K', 'Matsuda S', 'Kishimoto Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Asou N', 'Matsushima T', 'Takahashi M', 'Ogawa Y', 'Honda S', 'Ohno R']","['Division of Hematology, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Probability', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",2005/11/15 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/15 09:00'],"['2005/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21493 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Dec 15;104(12):2726-34. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21493.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society.'],['Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group AML 97 Study'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hungarian data therefore cover the time before and after the Chernobyl nuclear accident (1986). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the Chernobyl accident on childhood leukaemia incidence in Hungary. A population-based study was carried out using data of the National Paediatric Cancer Registry of Hungary from 1973 to 2002. The total number of cases was 2204. To test the effect of the Chernobyl accident the authors applied a new approach called 'Hypothesized Impact Period Interpolation'-model, which takes into account the increasing trend of childhood leukaemia incidence and the hypothesized exposure and latency times. The incidence of leukaemia in the age group 0-14 varied between 33.2 and 39.4 per million person-years along the observed 30 year period, and the incidence of childhood leukaemia showed a moderate increase of 0.71% annually (p = 0.0105). In the period of the hypothesized impact of the Chernobyl accident the incidence rate was elevated by 2.5% (95% CI: -8.1%; +14.3%), but this change was not statistically significant (p = 0.663). The age standardised incidence, the age distribution, the gender ratio, and the magnitude of increasing trend of childhood leukaemia incidence in Hungary were similar to other European countries. Applying the presented interpolation method the authors did not find a statistically significant increase in the leukaemia incidence in the period of the hypothesized impact of the Chernobyl accident.","['Torok, Szabolcs', 'Borgulya, Gabor', 'Lobmayer, Peter', 'Jakab, Zsuzsanna', 'Schuler, Dezso', 'Fekete, Gyorgy']","['Torok S', 'Borgulya G', 'Lobmayer P', 'Jakab Z', 'Schuler D', 'Fekete G']","['2nd Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, National Paediatric Cancer Registry of Hungary, Budapest, Hungary. torszab@gyer2.sote.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Hungary/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Models, Statistical', 'Sex Distribution']",2005/11/15 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/11/15 09:00'],"['2005/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10654-005-2340-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2005;20(11):899-906. doi: 10.1007/s10654-005-2340-9.,,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast lymphoblasts of 19 bone marrows of precursors B-ALL patients showed maturation arrest and exhibited several immunophenotypic aberrancies. Hematogones were identified by 4-color flow cytometry using optimal antibody combinations in many bone marrow samples. They were more commonly found in higher numbers in children, and there was found a general decline in hematogones with increasing age. Bone marrow hematogones were separately assessed as hematogones 1 population of early stage and hematogones 2 of mid-stage precursor B-cells, respectively. In some (about 30%) of hematogones a third type hematogones could be assessed in bone marrow samples. This small B-cell subpopulation was defined by CD10-positivity, coexpressing more mature markers CD19,CD20,CD22 and CD45bright.

During apoptosis cells die by degrading proteins and genome, whereas in the cell cycle cells divide and the genome is duplicated. There are very few studies on the role of cell cycle proteins in apoptosis although their role is distinctly different from that in the cell cycle. The significance of expression of cyclin A and other cyclin cell proteins (eg. Cdk2) in apoptosis remains to be investigated. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution pattern of cyclin A by using the stereptavidin - biotin - peroxidase technique in K-562 cells treated with doxorubicin. The analysis of cell cycle phases using cytophotometric methods to estimate the cellular response to doxorubicin was also used. Studied cells were treated with doxorubicin in the range 0.5; 5.0 and 10 microM. Expression of cyclin A in K-562 was 32.2; 41.8; 69.9%, respectively, according to doses of doxorubicin. The number of apoptotic cells was increasing together with the increase of doxorubicin doses as well as positive labeling for cyclin A. After doxorubicin treatment decrease of G1/G0 phase and the growth of cell percentage with dose dependent manner at G2/M phase, compared to control was observed.

Normal stem cells in the adult organism are responsible for tissue renewal and repair of aged or damaged tissue. A substantial characteristic of stem cells is their ability for self-renewal without loss of proliferation capacity with each cell division. The stem cells are immortal, and rather resistant to action of drugs. They are able to differentiate and form specific types of tissue due to the influence of microenvironmental and some other factors. Stem cells divide asymmetrically producing two daughter cells -- one is a new stem cell and the second is progenitor cell, which has the ability for differentiation and proliferation, but not the capability for self-renewal. Cancer stem cells are in many aspects similar to the stem cells. It has been proven that tumor cells are heterogeneous comprising rare tumor initiating cells and abundant non-tumor initiating cells. Tumor initiating cells -- cancer stem cells have the ability of self-renewal and proliferation, are resistant to drugs, and express typical markers of stem cells. It is not clear whether cancer stem cells originate from normal stem cells in consequence of genetic and epigenetic changes and/or by redifferentiation from somatic tumor cells to the stem-like cells. Probably both mechanisms are involved in the origin of cancer stem cells. Dysregulation of stem cell self-renewal is a likely requirement for the development of cancer. Isolation and identification of cancer stem cells in human tumors and in tumor cell lines has been successful. To date, the existence of cancer stem cells has been proven in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in breast cancer, in brain tumors, in lung cancer and gastrointestinal tumors. Cancer stem cell model is also consistent with some clinical observations. Although standard chemotherapy kills most cells in a tumor, cancer stem cells remain viable. Despite the small number of such cells, they might be the cause of tumor recurrence, sometimes many years after the ""successful"" treatment of primary tumor. Growth of metastases in distinct areas of body and their cellular heterogeneity might be consequence of cancer stem cell differentiation and/or dedifferentiation and asymmetric division of cancer stem cells. Further characterization of cancer stem cells is needed in order to find ways to destroy them, which might contribute significantly to the therapeutic management of malignant tumors.","['Soltysova, A', 'Altanerova, V', 'Altaner, C']","['Soltysova A', 'Altanerova V', 'Altaner C']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells']",2005/11/15 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/11/15 09:00'],"['2005/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2005;52(6):435-40.,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence of both typical and atypical BCR/ ABL gene rearrangements was determined in 110 patients suspected of CML using dual fusion fluorescence in situ hybridisation (DF-FISH) probes. RESULTS: Eighty-seven per cent of CML patients showed Ph translocation while 13% were negative for the Ph chromosome. About 71.9% of Ph-positive patients displayed the typical DF-FISH signal pattern. Atypical patterns among the Ph-positive patients included the concurrent loss of residual proximal 9q and distal 22q (10.4%), complex translocation with additional partners (9.4%), supernumerary Ph (3.1%), loss of residual 9q sequences proximal to breakpoint (3.1%), and deletion of distal derivative 22q signal (2.1%). Cryptic genetic alterations with loss of proximal 9q sequences were found in 13.5% of CML Ph-positive patients, which is associated with poor prognosis. Fusion signals were detected in 57.1% of CML Ph-negative patients, indicating cryptic BCR/ABL rearrangements (i.e., masked Ph). CONCLUSION: FISH is able to detect BCR/ABL fusion in CML with masked or variant Ph not apparent with conventional karyotyping.

We have now re-examined the activity of O-2093 in vivo and synthesized four structural analogs (O-2247, O-2248, O-3246, and O-3262), whose activity was assessed in: (a) binding assays carried out with membranes from cells overexpressing the human CB(1) and CB(2) receptors; (b) assays of transient receptor potential of the vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channel functional activity (measurement of [Ca(2+)](i)); (c) [(14)C]AEA cellular uptake and hydrolysis assays in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells; (d) the mouse 'tetrad' tests (analgesia on a hot plate, immobility on a 'ring', rectal hypothermia and hypolocomotion in an open field); and (e) the limb spasticity test in chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (CREAE) mice, a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). O-2093, either synthesized by us or commercially available, was inactive in the 'tetrad' up to a 20 mg kg(-1) dose (i.v.). Like O-2093, the other four compounds exhibited low affinity in CB(1) (K(i) from 1.3 to >10 microM) and CB(2) binding assays (1.3<K(i)< 8 microM), low potency and efficacy in a TRPV1 functional assay (EC(50)>10 microM), very low potency as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors (IC(50)>25 microM) and were inactive in the 'tetrad' up to a 30 mg kg(-1) dose (i.v.). While O-2247 and O-2248 were poor inhibitors of [(14)C]AEA cellular uptake (IC(50)>40 microM), O-3246 and O-3262 were quite potent in this assay. O-3246, which exhibits only a very subtle structural difference with O-2093, is the most potent inhibitor of AEA uptake reported in vitro under our experimental conditions (IC(50)=1.4 microM) and is 12-fold more potent than O-2093. When injected intravenously O-3246 and O-3262, again like O-2093 and unlike O-2247 and O-2248, significantly inhibited limb spasticity in mice with CREAE. These data confirm the potential utility of selective AEA uptake inhibitors as anti-spasticity drugs in MS and, given the very subtle chemical differences between potent and weak inhibitors of uptake, support further the existence of a specific mechanism for this process.","['Ligresti, Alessia', 'Cascio, Maria Grazia', 'Pryce, Gareth', 'Kulasegram, Sanjitha', 'Beletskaya, Irina', 'De Petrocellis, Luciano', 'Saha, Bijali', 'Mahadevan, Anu', 'Visintin, Cristina', 'Wiley, Jenny L', 'Baker, David', 'Martin, Billy R', 'Razdan, Raj K', 'Di Marzo, Vincenzo']","['Ligresti A', 'Cascio MG', 'Pryce G', 'Kulasegram S', 'Beletskaya I', 'De Petrocellis L', 'Saha B', 'Mahadevan A', 'Visintin C', 'Wiley JL', 'Baker D', 'Martin BR', 'Razdan RK', 'Di Marzo V']","['Endocannabinoid Research Group, Institute of Biomolecular Chemistry, C.N.R.

Bone marrow cells (BMC), harvested from normal BALB/c mice, were contaminated with variable EL9611 cells.

Lethally irradiated recipient BALB/c mice (7 Gy) received syngeneic bone marrow transplantation with purged or nonpurged cell mixtures of 10(7) BMC contaminated with variable numbers (10(2)-10(5)) of EL9611 cells. All of the irradiated controls died due to sepsis. All of the mice injected with nonpurged cell mixtures developed leukemia and died, whereas the mice transplanted with ZnPcS2P2-PDT-treated mixtures had a longer survival time, and the fewer leukemic cells there were in the cell mixtures, the higher the leukemia-free survival rate.

Gene-environment interactions were estimated using both case-control and case-only analyses. The polymorphisms of CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1 and NQO1 were not associated with the risk of leukaemia. The slow EPHX1 allele was negatively associated with childhood leukaemia while an inverse non-significant association was observed with the fast EPHX1 allele. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was not related to leukaemia, but an interaction was observed in the case-only analysis with CYP1A1*2A variant allele (odds ratio (OR) 2.2 [1.0-4.9]) and with GSTM1 deletion (OR 2.3 [1.2-4.4]).

Hyperagonist IL-15 x IL-15R alpha fusion proteins.,1612-9,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is crucial for the generation of multiple lymphocyte subsets (natural killer (NK), NK-T cells, and memory CD8 T cells), and transpresentation of IL-15 by monocytes and dendritic cells has been suggested to be the dominant activating process of these lymphocytes. We have previously shown that a natural soluble form of IL-15R alpha chain corresponding to the entire extracellular domain of IL-15R alpha behaves as a high affinity IL-15 antagonist. In sharp contrast with this finding, we demonstrate in this report that a recombinant, soluble sushi domain of IL-15R alpha, which bears most of the binding affinity for IL-15, behaves as a potent IL-15 agonist by enhancing its binding and biological effects (proliferation and protection from apoptosis) through the IL-15R beta/gamma heterodimer, whereas it does not affect IL-15 binding and function of the tripartite IL-15R alpha/beta/gamma membrane receptor. Our results suggest that, if naturally produced, such soluble sushi domains might be involved in the IL-15 transpresentation mechanism. Fusion proteins (RLI and ILR), in which IL-15 and IL-15R alpha-sushi are attached by a flexible linker, are even more potent than the combination of IL-15 plus sIL-15R alpha-sushi.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment began with a prephase (low-dose steroids, vincristine and cyclophosphamide), except in patients with low tumor burden. Group A (resected stage I and abdominal stage II disease) received three courses of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone. Group B (not eligible for groups A or C) received five courses of chemotherapy comprising high-dose methotrexate, infusional cytarabine and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate. Group C (patients with central nervous system and/or bone marrow involvement with < 30% of blast cells) received eight courses containing intensified high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytarabine, etoposide and triple IT injections. RESULTS: The 2 year event-free survival and overall survival rates for the 72 patients were 65% and 70%, respectively. Age > or = 33 years and high lactate dehydrogenase value were associated with a shorter survival. No response to COP was also associated with a poor outcome in group B. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced-stage Burkitt lymphoma, including those with bone marrow and/or central nervous system involvement, can be cured with a short-term intensive chemotherapy regime tailored to the tumor burden.","['Divine, M', 'Casassus, P', 'Koscielny, S', 'Bosq, J', 'Sebban, C', 'Le Maignan, C', 'Stamattoulas, A', 'Dupriez, B', 'Raphael, M', 'Pico, J-L', 'Ribrag, V']","['Divine M', 'Casassus P', 'Koscielny S', 'Bosq J', 'Sebban C', 'Le Maignan C', 'Stamattoulas A', 'Dupriez B', 'Raphael M', 'Pico JL', 'Ribrag V']","['Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/therapeutic use', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2005/11/15 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/15 09:00'],"['2005/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)47806-X [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdi403 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2005 Dec;16(12):1928-35. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdi403.

BRCA1 has also been implicated in telomere maintenance through its ability to regulate the transcription of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, resulting in telomere shortening, and to colocalize with the telomere-binding protein TRF1. The high incidence of nonreciprocal translocations in tumors arising from BRCA1 mutation carriers and Brca1-null mice also raises the possibility that BRCA1 plays a role in telomere protection. To date, however, the consequences for telomere status of disrupting BRCA1 have not been reported. To examine the role of BRCA1 in telomere regulation, we have expressed a dominant-negative mutant of BRCA1 (trBRCA1), known to disrupt multiple functions of BRCA1, in telomerase-positive mammary epithelial cells (SVCT) and telomerase-negative ALT cells (GM847). In SVCT cells, expression of trBRCA1 resulted in an increased incidence of anaphase bridges and in an increase in telomere length, but no change in telomerase activity. In GM847 cells, trBRCA1 also increased anaphase bridge formation but did not induce any change in telomere length. BRCA1 colocalized with TRF2 in telomerase-positive cells and with a small subset of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) in ALT cells. Together, these results raise the possibility that BRCA1 could play a role in telomere protection and suggest a potential mechanism for one of the phenotypes of BRCA1-deficient cells.","['French, Juliet D', 'Dunn, Jasmyn', 'Smart, Chanel E', 'Manning, Nathan', 'Brown, Melissa A']","['French JD', 'Dunn J', 'Smart CE', 'Manning N', 'Brown MA']","['School of Molecular and Microbial Sciences, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Anaphase/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Genes, BRCA1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/*physiology', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/genetics', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20290 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Mar;45(3):277-89. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20290.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We characterized two cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with marker chromosomes and 11q23-25 amplicons. Case 1 was a 14-year-old male with an additional ring of chromosome 11 material as the sole karyotypic abnormality, as determined by G-banding and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. Standard comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) showed amplification in 11q23-qter. However, the MLL gene, in 11q23, was not amplified by FISH. Case 2 was a 38-year-old male with the G-banding karyotype 51,XY,+8,+19,+3mar and with 11q22-qter amplification by standard CGH. This patient also had the MLL-LARG fusion gene. We used microarray-based CGH (array-CGH) to characterize the amplicons. In case 1, the amplified region in 11q24.3-25 (5.5 Mb) was continuous, and MLL was not amplified, as expected. In case 2, the amplicon was divided into two distinct parts, in 11q23.3 (1.2 Mb) and in 11q23.3-25 (13.3 Mb). It contained a loss ( approximately 1 Mb) in 11q23.3, and the amplicon breakpoint was in the middle of MLL. Although the amplicon size varied, the patients had a common amplified region in 11q24-25 that comprised 14 genes. Expression microarray of case 1 revealed that three of these genes, FLI1, NFRKB, and SNX19, were also overexpressed. The results indicate that the 11q24-q25 region may harbor new candidate oncogenes. In addition, the complex amplicon of case 2 suggests some intriguing chromosomal mechanisms.","['Tyybakinoja, Anne', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla', 'Elonen, Erkki', 'Knuutila, Sakari']","['Tyybakinoja A', 'Saarinen-Pihkala U', 'Elonen E', 'Knuutila S']","['Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute and HUSLAB, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Deletion', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/metabolism']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20288 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Mar;45(3):257-64. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20288.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NFRKB protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with RMS is 70% with the use of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Novel therapeutic approaches are necessary to improve on these outcomes particularly among the more aggressive alveolar RMS (ARMS) and late stages of disease, where 5-year survival is less than 20%. Retinoids have been successfully used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and neuroblastoma. PURPOSE: However, analysis of retinoids as a differentiating agent for RMS has been incomplete. This work examined the ability of retinoic acid (RA) to promote differentiation of RMS cell lines by examining the expression of myogenic proteins in five RMS cell lines in response to All-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) or 9-cis retinoic acid (CRA). RESULTS: Analysis of growth curves indicates that both retinoids suppress cell growth of Rh4 and Rh28. RD cells only responded to-CRA whereas Rh30 and Rh18 did not respond. Following treatment with ATRA FACS analysis showed an altered cell cycle with the same pattern as the growth curves. ATRA altered cellular morphology of two cell lines, Rh4 and Rh28, and induced Troponin T expression in these cells suggesting a differentiating effect. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that retinoids are effective inducers of growth arrest and differentiation in some RMS cell lines, and offer a basis for further in vivo testing in mice of ATRA as a potential approach to ARMS treatment.","['Barlow, Jason W', 'Wiley, Joe C', 'Mous, Marieke', 'Narendran, Aru', 'Gee, Matthew F W', 'Goldberg, Michael', 'Sexsmith, Elizabeth', 'Malkin, David']","['Barlow JW', 'Wiley JC', 'Mous M', 'Narendran A', 'Gee MF', 'Goldberg M', 'Sexsmith E', 'Malkin D']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mutation', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Troponin T/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2005/11/12 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20650 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Nov;47(6):773-84. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20650.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During military conflicts, US military personnel have been wounded by DU shrapnel. The health effects of embedded DU are unknown. Published data from our laboratory demonstrated that DU exposure in vitro can transform immortalized human osteoblast cells (HOS) to the tumorigenic phenotype. Results from our laboratory have also shown that DU is genotoxic and mutagenic in cultured human cells. Internalized DU could be a carcinogenic risk and concurrent alpha particle and heavy metal toxic effects complicate this potential risk. Anecdotal reports have suggested that DU can cause leukemia. To better assess this risk, we have developed an in vivo leukemogenesis model. This model involves using murine hematopoietic cells (FDC-P1) that are dependent on stimulation by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin 3 (IL-3) and injected into mice to produce myeloid leukemia. Although immortalized, these cells are not tumorigenic on subcutaneous inoculation in mice. Intravenous injection of FDC-P1 cells into DU-implanted DBA/2 mice was followed by the development of leukemias in 76% of all mice implanted with DU pellets. In contrast, only 12% of control mice developed leukemia. Karyotypic analysis confirmed that the leukemias originated from FDC-P1 cells. The growth properties of leukemic cells from bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node were assessed and indicate that the FDC-P1 cells had become transformed in vivo. The kidney, spleen, bone marrow, muscle, and urine showed significant elevations in tissue uranium levels prior to induction of leukemia. These results demonstrated that a DU altered in vivo environment may be involved in the pathogenesis of DU induced leukemia in an animal model.","['Miller, Alexandra C', 'Bonait-Pellie, Catherine', 'Merlot, Robert F', 'Michel, John', 'Stewart, Michael', 'Lison, Paul D']","['Miller AC', 'Bonait-Pellie C', 'Merlot RF', 'Michel J', 'Stewart M', 'Lison PD']","['Applied Cellular Radiobiology Department, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research, Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20889-5603, USA. millera@afrri.usuhs.mil']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Animal', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uranium/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/11/12 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-005-8226-z [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2005 Nov;279(1-2):97-104. doi: 10.1007/s11010-005-8226-z.,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells, we found that As2O3 induced cell death in time- and dose-dependent manners. Similarly, dependent regulation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) promoter, mRNA synthesis, and resultant protein expression was also observed. Additionally, transfection of a small interfering RNA of p21 could block the As2O3-induced cell growth arrest. The As2O3-induced p21 activation was attenuated by inhibitors of EGFR and MEK in a dose-dependent manner. Using a reporter assay, we demonstrated the involvement of the EGFR-Ras-Raf-ERK1/2 pathway in the promoter activation. In contrast, JNK inhibitor enhanced the As2O3-induced p21 activation, also in a dose-dependent fashion. Over-expression of a dominant negative JNK plasmid likewise also enhanced this activation. Furthermore, MEK inhibitor attenuated the anti-tumor effect of As2O3. In contrast, in combination with JNK inhibitor and As2O3 enhanced cellular cytotoxicity. Therefore, we conclude that in A431 cells the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways might differentially contribute to As2O3-induced p21 expression and then due to cellular cytotoxicity.","['Huang, Huei-Sheng', 'Liu, Zi-Miao', 'Ding, Ling', 'Chang, Wen-Chang', 'Hsu, Pei-Yin', 'Wang, Shu-Hui', 'Chi, Ching-Chi', 'Chuang, Cheng-Hsin']","['Huang HS', 'Liu ZM', 'Ding L', 'Chang WC', 'Hsu PY', 'Wang SH', 'Chi CC', 'Chuang CH']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. huanghs@mail.ncku.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*metabolism', '*Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*metabolism/toxicity', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'raf Kinases/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11373-005-9040-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2006 Jan;13(1):113-25. doi: 10.1007/s11373-005-9040-z.

Formation of a molecular conjugate vector by conjugation of noninfective ecotropic murine Moloney leukemia virus to polylysine (eMMLV-PL) enabled high-efficiency transduction of human HPC using in vitro and in vivo assays. Xenotransplanted NOD-SCID mice durably expressed the transgene in human leukocytes and human progenitor cells with eMMLV-PL achieving three-fold increased transduction efficiency when directly compared to optimized amphotropic MMLV (aMMLV) transduction. Both aMMLV and eMMLV assembled conjugate vectors showed similar transduction efficiency indicating predominant polylysine-mediated uptake. Integration of retroviral sequences was determined from individual human HPC recovered from eMMLV-PL-xenotransplanted animals. This simple and versatile concept of conjugate gene transfer vectors has the potential to enhance transduction efficiency as well as to improve certain safety aspects of human gene therapy. Moreover, because it permits effective cellular internalization of particles, this concept of molecular conjugates can be used as research tool to investigate the interactions of otherwise noninfectious viruses or modified viral particles at the genomic level.","['Yang, G', 'Zhong, Q', 'Huang, W', 'Reiser, J', 'Schwarzenberger, P']","['Yang G', 'Zhong Q', 'Huang W', 'Reiser J', 'Schwarzenberger P']","['Department of Genetics, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Polylysine/*chemistry', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['7700911 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cgt.7700911 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2006 May;13(5):460-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700911.,,['25104-18-1 (Polylysine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study comprised 76 children (38 girls, 38 boys) ages 9.84 to 210 months who were being treated for various malignant diseases with ifosfamide. The children were enrolled after identification of genotype coding for three classes of glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) at the initial stage of diagnosis. (P) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze the urinary excretion of unchanged ifosfamide, 2DCIF, and 3DCIF metabolites on consecutive days after the end of the 3-hour infusion of ifosfamide. In children with polymorphic locus of the GSTP1 gene compared with children with homozygous wild alleles, increased urinary excretion of 3DCIF (P=0.029) and decreased creatinine clearance was found (Mann-Whitney P=0.03; median 81.1 mL/min/1.73 m vs. 105.0 mL/min/1.73 m, respectively). The authors' multidimensional analysis model revealed that besides the total ifosfamide dose and co-administration of other toxic drugs, polymorphic locus of GSTP1 gene may be one of the factors determining a higher toxicity of the cytostatic agent. The model was construed at P=0.029. Moreover, no correlation was found between the GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype and ifosfamide toxicity and the urinary excretion of its metabolites. The results of this analysis indicate that individual reactions to ifosfamide can depend on inherited genetic polymorphisms, especially associated with the GSTP1 gene coding detoxifying enzyme.","['Zielinska, Elzbieta', 'Zubowska, Malgorzata', 'Misiura, Konrad']","['Zielinska E', 'Zubowska M', 'Misiura K']","['Clinic of Paediatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. ezieln@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/*urine', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/urine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/urine', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/drug effects', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/*urine', 'Infant', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/*urine', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology/urine', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology/*urine', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200511000-00003 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000187429.52616.8a [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Nov;27(11):582-9. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000187429.52616.8a.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '36761-83-8 (dechloroethylcyclophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'IIB78D4DQA (dechloroethylifosfamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among male occupations, increased risks were noted for sales agents, seamen, and chemical process workers. For female occupations, increased risks were observed among mechanics, iron and metalware workers, hairdressers, and launderers and dry cleaners.

Several of these loci, including the Friend virus susceptibility gene 2 (Fv2), dominant white spotting gene (W), and Steel gene (Sl), regulate the initial polyclonal expansion of infected erythroid progenitor cells. W and Sl encode the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, stem cell factor, respectively. W mutant mice are severely anemic, and earlier work suggested that this defect in erythroid differentiation is the cause for the resistance to Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia. Here we show that in bone marrow, W/W(v) mice have near normal numbers of target cells and the initial infection of bone marrow occurs normally in vivo. In contrast, spleen cells from W/W(v) mice infected both in vitro and in vivo with Friend virus failed to give rise to erythropoietin-independent colonies at any time following Friend virus infection, suggesting that mutation of the Kit receptor specifically affects target cells in the spleen, rendering the mutant mice resistant to the development of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia. In addition, we show that the Kit+ pathogenic targets of Friend virus in the spleen are distinct from the pathogenic targets in bone marrow and this population of spleen target cells is markedly decreased in W/W(v) mice and these cells fail to express Sf-Stk.

These viruses can infect a variety of cell types, but only T lymphocytes become transformed, which is defined in vitro as showing indefinite interleukin-2-independent growth. Studies have indicated that HTLV-1 has a preferential tropism for CD4+ T cells in vivo and is associated with the development of leukemia and neurological disease. Conversely, the in vivo T-cell tropism of HTLV-2 is less clear, although it appears that CD8+ T cells preferentially harbor the provirus, with only a few cases of disease association. The difference in T-cell transformation tropism has been confirmed in vitro as shown by the preferential transformation of CD4+ T cells by HTLV-1 versus the transformation of CD8+ T cells by HTLV-2. Our previous studies showed that Tax and overlapping Rex do not confer the distinct T-cell transformation tropisms between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. Therefore, for this study HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 recombinants were generated to assess the contribution of LTR and env sequences in T-cell transformation tropism. Both sets of proviral recombinants expressed p19 Gag following transfection into cells. Furthermore, recombinant viruses were replication competent and had the capacity to transform T lymphocytes. Our data showed that exchange of the env gene resulted in altered T-cell transformation tropism compared to wild-type virus, while exchange of long terminal repeat sequences had no significant effect.

HTLV-1 encodes the positive trans-regulatory proteins Tax and Rex, both of which are essential for viral replication. Tax activates transcription initiation from the viral long terminal repeat and modulates the transcription or activity of a number of cellular genes. Rex regulates gene expression posttranscriptionally by facilitating the cytoplasmic expression of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs. Tax and Rex mutants have been identified that have defective activities or impaired biochemical properties associated with their function. To ultimately determine the contribution of specific protein activities on viral replication and cellular transformation of primary T cells, mutants need to be characterized in the context of an infectious molecular clone. Since the tax and rex genes are in partially overlapping reading frames, mutation in one gene frequently disrupts the other, confounding interpretation of mutational analyses in the context of the virus. Here we generated and characterized a unique proviral clone (H1IT) in which the tax and rex genes were separated by expressing Tax from an internal ribosome entry site. We showed that H1IT expresses both functional Tax and Rex. In short- and long-term coculture assays, H1IT was competent to infect and immortalize primary human T cells similar to wild-type HTLV-1. In contrast, H1IT failed to efficiently replicate and persist in inoculated rabbits, thus emphasizing the importance of temporal and quantitative regulation of specific mRNA for viral survival in vivo.","['Younis, Ihab', 'Yamamoto, Brenda', 'Phipps, Andrew', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Younis I', 'Yamamoto B', 'Phipps A', 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology/virology', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/23/14473 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.23.14473-14481.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Dec;79(23):14473-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.23.14473-14481.2005.,,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",PMC1287553,,,,,"['R01 CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) provide a major thrust of the inflammatory response, though excessive ROSs may be deleterious. G-CSF stimulation showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in ROS production, correlating with activation of Lyn and Akt. Inhibition of Lyn, PI3-kinase, and Akt abrogated G-CSF-induced ROS production. This was also blocked by DPI, a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Following G-CSF stimulation, neutrophils from Lyn-/- mice produced less ROSs than wild-type littermates. G-CSF induced both serine phosphorylation and membrane translocation of p47phox, a subunit of NADPH oxidase. Because patients with a truncated G-CSF receptor have a high risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we hypothesized that dysregulation of ROSs contributes to leukemogenesis. Cells expressing the truncated G-CSF receptor produced more ROSs than those with the full-length receptor. G-CSF-induced ROS production was enhanced in bone marrow-derived neutrophils expressing G-CSFRdelta715, a truncated receptor. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine diminished G-CSF-induced ROS production and cell proliferation by inhibiting Akt activation. These data suggest that the G-CSF-induced Lyn-PI3K-Akt pathway drives ROS production. One beneficial effect of therapeutic targeting of Lyn-PI3K-kinase-Akt cascade is abrogating ROS production.","['Zhu, Quan-Sheng', 'Xia, Ling', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Lowell, Clifford A', 'Touw, Ivo P', 'Corey, Seth J']","['Zhu QS', 'Xia L', 'Mills GB', 'Lowell CA', 'Touw IP', 'Corey SJ']","['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas--M.

There were no significant differences in transplantation characteristics between the HLA DR15-positive and -negative groups. There was no significant difference in chronic GVHD, OS, or PFS between the HLA DR15-positive versus-negative groups in any disease or donor relation subgroups.

Whereas chlorambucil, busulfan, and radiophosphorus (32P) have been demonstrated to increase the risk of transformation, the leukemogenic potential of hydroxyurea (HU) continues to be a matter of debate. Clinical studies have suggested that HU may cause a small increase in the risk of AML, but it has proven difficult to establish whether AML is actually caused by HU or arises during the natural progression of PV and ET. Reports that HU undergoes metabolic activation to species that induce mutation appear to support the notion that it is leukemogenic. Here, we suggest that the ability of HU to induce mutation in cell culture studies results from the generation of nitrogen dioxide via the autoxidation of nitric oxide, a product of HU metabolism. However, we argue that autoxidation would not occur in vivo, leading to the conclusion that generation of the mutagen nitrogen dioxide is peculiar to cell culture systems and has little relevance to the use of HU in the management of PV and ET.","['Burkitt, Mark J', 'Raafat, Alaeddin']","['Burkitt MJ', 'Raafat A']","['Gray Cancer Institute, PO Box 100, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, HA6 2JR United Kingdom. mark_john_burkitt@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/etiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/drug therapy', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/06/01 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65664-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3429 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Mar 15;107(6):2219-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3429.

Mice heterozygous for the Runx1 null mutation, Runx1+/-, are considered to be genetically comparable with human FPD/AML patients but do not develop spontaneous leukaemia. To induce additional genetic alterations, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was employed with the use of BXH2 mice, which develop myeloid leukaemia because of the random integration of retrovirus present in the mouse. Heterozygous disruption of Runx1 in BXH2 mice resulted in a shortening of the latency period of leukaemia. In addition, BXH2-Runx1+/- mice exhibited more marked myeloid features than control mice. Moreover, the c-Kit gene, mutated in human RUNX leukaemias, was recurrently activated in BXH2-Runx1+/- mice, and a colony-forming assay revealed synergism between the Runx1+/- status and c-KIT overexpression. In conclusion, the BXH2-Runx1+/- system is a promising mouse model to investigate the mechanism of leukaemogenesis in FPD/AML.","['Yamashita, Namiko', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Huang, Liqun', 'Yanagida, Masatoshi', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Nakamura, Takuro', 'Shigesada, Katsuya', 'Asou, Norio', 'Ito, Yoshiaki']","['Yamashita N', 'Osato M', 'Huang L', 'Yanagida M', 'Kogan SC', 'Iwasaki M', 'Nakamura T', 'Shigesada K', 'Asou N', 'Ito Y']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5793 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05793.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Nov;131(4):495-507. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05793.x.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,['U01-CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with normal bone marrow, the chemotherapy resistance protein MRP1 and apoptosis related genes BAX and CASPASE3 were found to be overexpressed in AML blasts. Univariate analysis revealed that the most important determinants of prognosis were presence of balanced translocations, age, white blood cell count and extramedullary disease, in order of statistical significance. In a multivariate analysis, balanced translocations retained their prognostic significance and FLT3 ITD as well as high gene expression of MDR1 were negative prognostic factors.

The aim of this study was to generate a transcriptional profile of relapsed ALL to increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in therapy failure. RNA was extracted from 11 pairs of cryopreserved pre-B ALL bone marrow specimens taken from the same patients at diagnosis and relapse, and analysed using HG-U133A microarrays. Relapse specimens overexpressed genes that are involved with cell growth and proliferation, in keeping with their aggressive phenotype. When tested in 72 independent specimens of pre-B ALL and T-ALL, the identified genes could successfully differentiate between diagnosis and relapse in either lineage, indicating the existence of relapse mechanisms common to both. These genes have functions relevant for oncogenesis, drug resistance and metastasis, but are not related to classical multidrug-resistance pathways. Increased expression of the top-ranked gene (BSG) at diagnosis was significantly associated with adverse outcome. Several chromosomal loci, including 19p13, were identified as potential hotspots for aberrant gene expression in relapsed ALL. Our results provide evidence for a link between drug resistance and the microenvironment that has previously only been considered in the context of solid tumour biology.","['Beesley, Alex H', 'Cummings, Aaron J', 'Freitas, Joseph R', 'Hoffmann, Katrin', 'Firth, Martin J', 'Ford, Jette', 'de Klerk, Nicolas H', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Beesley AH', 'Cummings AJ', 'Freitas JR', 'Hoffmann K', 'Firth MJ', 'Ford J', 'de Klerk NH', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Basigin/genetics/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5785 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05785.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Nov;131(4):447-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05785.x.,,"['0 (BSG protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '136894-56-9 (Basigin)']",,,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 2006 Oct;135(2):274-5.

The 50-year commemoration of the March 1, 1954 Bravo thermonuclear test has rekindled interest in this area. This paper explores the documentation for, and the plausibility of, claims for disease causation by nuclear testing. Given the sheer volume of testing that the US conducted in the Pacific, it appears plausible that excess cancer would have occurred in areas of Micronesia other than the Marshall Islands. An excess of birth abnormalities in the Marshall Islands has been documented. While diabetes is not a radiogenic disease, and other cancers are generally less radiogenic than leukemia or thyroid cancer, the social and cultural effects of nuclear testing specifically, and the strategic uses to which Micronesia has been put generally, have had roles in the social production of disease.

BACKGROUND: Pigmentation of finger- and toenails presents a wide range of differential diagnostic considerations. They can be of infectious, melanocytic or exogenous origin or caused by metabolic disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three women and one man, ranging in age from 62 and 87 years, were treated with hydroxycarbamide for myeloproliferative syndrome or chronic myelogenous leukemia for five to twelve years. All four patients were Fitzpatrick skin types II. RESULTS: Several months after starting this therapy, they developed streaky longitudinal pigmentation of their fingernails and toenails. In two patients, these findings were diagnosed by chance, whereas two patients sought dermatological advice because of nail pigmentation. In two of the patients the longitudinal pigmentation disappeared a few month after discontinuation of hydroxycarbamide. The melanonychia persisted in another patient, while the fourth was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: When melanonychia is identified in hematology-oncology patients, a careful medical history should be obtained. A list of medications is crucial, since hydroxycarbamide causes nail pigmentation. In each case of nail pigmentation, an acral lentiginous melanoma must be excluded.","['Neynaber, Sven', 'Wolff, Hans', 'Plewig, Gerd', 'Wienecke, Ralf']","['Neynaber S', 'Wolff H', 'Plewig G', 'Wienecke R']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Dermatologie und Allergologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,101164708,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hyperpigmentation/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/drug therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/drug therapy', 'Nail Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/11/12 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/12 09:00'],"['2005/11/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1439-0353.2004.04093.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges. 2004 Jul;2(7):588-91. doi: 10.1046/j.1439-0353.2004.04093.x.,,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],,,Longitudinale Melanonychie bei Einnahme von Hydroxycarbamid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vitro studies in human fibroblast models indicated that telomere dysfunction results in chromosome instability. Loss of telomere function can result either from critical shortening of telomeric DNA or from loss of distinct telomere-capping proteins. It is less clear whether telomere dysfunction has an important role in human cancer development in vivo. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a good model to study mechanisms that generate chromosome instability in human cancer development because distinct groups of AML are characterized either by aberrations that theoretically could result from telomere dysfunction (terminal deletions, gains/losses of chromosome parts, nonreciprocal translocations), or aberrations that are unlikely to result from telomere dysfunction (e.g., reciprocal translocations or inversions). Here we demonstrate that AML with multiple chromosome aberrations that theoretically could result from telomere dysfunction is invariably characterized by critically short telomeres. Short telomeres in this group are not associated with low telomerase activity or decreased expression of essential telomeric capping proteins TRF2 and POT1. In contrast, telomerase activity levels are significantly higher in AML with short telomeres. Notably, short telomeres in the presence of high telomerase may relate to significantly higher expression of TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere length. Our observations suggest that, consistent with previous in vitro fibroblast models, age-related critical telomere shortening may have a role in generating chromosome instability in human AML development.","['Swiggers, Susan J J', 'Kuijpers, Marianne A', 'de Cort, Maartje J M', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Zijlmans, J Mark J M']","['Swiggers SJ', 'Kuijpers MA', 'de Cort MJ', 'Beverloo HB', 'Zijlmans JM']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cellular Senescence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'TATA Box Binding Protein-Like Proteins/metabolism', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/*physiology', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/11/11 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/11/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20286 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Mar;45(3):247-56. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20286.,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TATA Box Binding Protein-Like Proteins)', '0 (TERF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA interference is an approach to silence gene at post-transcriptional level. We show that dsRNA targeted against the translocation region leads to more than 90% inhibition of BCR-ABL mRNA and protein expression levels using K562 as a model. Lack of BCR-ABL leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase as observed by decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p21 and p27 cdk inhibitors mRNA. Apoptosis resistance imparted by BCR-ABL is lost in these cells in caspase-dependent or independent manner. Decrease in Bcl-XL is observed along with decrease in mitochondrial membrane integrity. Transient removal of BCR-ABL expression has a profound effect on proliferation and clonogenic capacity also confirmed by long-term silencing using lentiviral vectors. Interestingly, low level of BCR-ABL message leads to enhanced erythroid differentiation and reduced expression of megakaryocytic markers. Importantly, in six CML patient samples studied, silencing BCR-ABL in the lineage depleted enriched stem cell population leads to a decrease in colony-forming capacity. Thus, long-term silencing of BCR-ABL might prove to be a promising alternative approach in CML patients especially for those who do not respond to any other drug treatment.","['Rangatia, J', 'Bonnet, D']","['Rangatia J', 'Bonnet D']","['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay/methods']",2005/11/11 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/11/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403999 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403999 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):68-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403999.,,"['0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are multifunctional proteins with MMPs inhibitory effects. However, little is known about the application of TIMPs in the treatment of leukemia. Here, we investigated the effects of TIMP-3 overexpression via adenoviral gene delivery on the in vitro growth and invasiveness of leukemic cells and the in vivo progress of K562-derived xenografts in nude mice. The in vitro invasiveness of K562 cells was markedly impaired by AdTIMP-3 infection. Moreover, TIMP-3 significantly inhibited K562-derived angiogenic factors-induced proliferation, migration and bFGF-induced tube formation of endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro, and reduced VEGF-induced gelatinases expression and activation in ECs. Although TIMP-3 overexpression had no direct effect on the growth of K562 cells in vitro, repeated intratumoral injection of AdTIMP-3 significantly inhibited the growth of K562 xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, lower microvessel density, less vessel maturity and increased apoptosis were observed in AdTIMP-3-treated K562 xenografts, suggesting the importance of antiangiogenic action of TIMP-3. These data demonstrated the potential of applying AdTIMP-3 as an effective antiangiogenic adjuvant in the treatment of leukemia progression.","['Yu, X F', 'Yang, C', 'Liang, L H', 'Liu, B', 'Zhou, B', 'Li, B', 'Han, Z C']","['Yu XF', 'Yang C', 'Liang LH', 'Liu B', 'Zhou B', 'Li B', 'Han ZC']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gelatinases/biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",2005/11/11 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/11/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404021 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404021 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):1-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404021.,,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to parental HL-60 cells, doxorubicin and etoposide failed to trigger apoptosis in chemoresistant HL-60/Doxo and HL-60NP16 cells overexpressing MRP1 and MDR1, respectively. Chemosensitive HL-60 cells displayed sphingosine kinase-1 inhibition coupled with ceramide generation. In contrast, chemoresistant HL-60/ Doxo and HL-60/VP16 had sustained sphingosine kinase-1 activity and did not produce ceramide during treatment. Enforced expression of sphingosine kinase-1 in chemosensitive HL-60 cells resulted in marked inhibition of apoptosis that was mediated by blockade of mitochondrial cytochrome c efflux hence suggesting a control of apoptosis at the pre-mitochondrial level. Incubation with cell-permeable ceramide of chemoresistant cells led to a sphingosine kinase-1 inhibition and apoptosis both prevented by sphingosine kinase-1 over-expression. Furthermore, F-12509a, a new sphingosine kinase inhibitor, led to ceramide accumulation, decrease in sphingosine 1-phosphate content and caused apoptosis equally in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines that is inhibited by adding sphingosine 1-phosphate or overexpressing sphingosine kinase-1.

The MT-2 cell is known to produce multiple cytokines spontaneously. In this study, we investigated the impact of ActD on the cytokine production from MT-2 cells and HIV-1 replication in a latently infected cell line, U1. MT-2 cells were pulse-treated with 0 or 200 nM of ActD, and culture supernatants were collected 3 days after incubation. Supernatants from untreated cells (Sup0) induced HIV-1 replication by 150-fold in U1 cells. Culture supernatants from ActD-treated cells (Sup200) enhanced HIV-1 replication by 1200-fold. A combination of a sequential chromatographic approach and mass spectrometric analysis identified that the HIV-inducing factors in Sup200 were interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-beta. Quantitative analysis revealed that ActD treatment increased the concentration of IL-6 in Sup200 by 600% compared with that in Sup0 but decreased the amount of TNFbeta in Sup200 by 85%. Northern blot analysis showed that ActD treatment increased IL-6 transcripts; however, no change was seen in TNFbeta transcripts.

H&E-stained tissue sections from the archives of the Shanxi Tumor Hospital, China, were reviewed and 447 cases with sufficient materials were selected for detailed study. A panel of antibodies and probes was assembled, including antibodies to ALK1, bcl-6, CDs 1alpha, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 23, 30, 43, 56, 68, 79alpha, and 99, cyclin D1, EMA, kappa, lambda, LMP1, PAX5, TdT, Vs38C and ZAP70, plus EBER RNA probe by in situ hybridization. The 447 lymphoma cases, subtyped according to the WHO classification, were assembled in triplicate into 11 tissue microarrays and examined with the panel of markers described. Among the 447 cases, 385 (82.6%) were confirmed to be non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and 62 (13.9%) were Hodgkin lymphomas of classic type (CHL). Of the NHL cases, 68.6% were B-cell lymphomas and 30.6% T/NK-cell lymphomas. Histiocytic neoplasms accounted for only three cases (0.8%). Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) were the most common subtype (35.1%), followed by peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified (PTun, 12.0%), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MALT lymphomas, 11.7%), follicular lymphomas (FL, 8.6%), T-lymphoblastic lymphomas (T-LBL, 7.0%), anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL, 4.2%), B small lymphocytic lymphomas (B SLL, 3.6%), and mantle cell lymphomas (MCL, 2.6%). Of 263 B-cell neoplasms, 105 (39.9%) expressed immunoglobulin light chain, including 52 kappa and 53 lambda, detectable in paraffin sections. The incidence of DLBCL was similar to many Western countries and Asia. The frequency of FL was, however, much lower than the usual pattern in Western countries, although NK/T-cell lymphomas were more common (30.6%), similar to other countries in Asia, including Japan and Korea. With regard to markers of EBV infection, 8 of 385 (2.1%) NHL cases gave positive findings by both in situ hybridization (EBER RNA) and immunohistochemistry (LMP-1), whereas 24 (6.2%) expressed only the EBER and 12 (3.1%) expressed only LMP-1. EBV positivity was found in 24 of 119 (20.2%) T and NK cell lymphomas, in 20 of 263 (7.6%) B cell neoplasms, and in 37 of 62 (59.7%) CHLs. In CHLs there was complete concordance of results by both in situ hybridization (EBER RNA) and immunohistochemistry (LMP-1) procedures. ZAP70 was detected in most T cell-lineage disorders (61.4%) and also in a subset of B small lymphocytic lymphomas (50%). However, ZAP-70 was expressed in a minority of other types of B-cell lymphomas, including precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (25%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (26.7%), follicular lymphoma (15.2%), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (9.1%). Immunohistochemical analysis represents an effective method for assessing ZAP-70 expression and reveals that a variety of B-cell malignant neoplasms express ZAP-70, albeit at low frequency.","['Wang, Jinfen', 'Young, Lillian', 'Win, William', 'Taylor, Clive R']","['Wang J', 'Young L', 'Win W', 'Taylor CR']","['Department of Pathology, Shanxi Tumor Hospital, Taiyuan, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'China/epidemiology', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma/*classification/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', '*Tissue Array Analysis', '*World Health Organization', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis']",2005/11/11 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/11/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['00129039-200512000-00005 [pii]', '10.1097/01.pai.0000176161.38402.b2 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2005 Dec;13(4):323-32. doi: 10.1097/01.pai.0000176161.38402.b2.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occasional CD5-positive neoplasms with prominent co-expression of these antigens are encountered, precluding definitive immunophenotypic classification. The authors studied the clinicopathologic features of 26 neoplasms with this indeterminate immunophenotype. Available morphologic material was reviewed and analysis of CYCLIN D1 derangement was performed in selected cases by a combination of immunohistochemical, molecular, and cytogenetic techniques. Individual neoplasms were classified based on correlation of morphologic features and results of CYCLIN D1 studies. The neoplasms were classified into five categories: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (14 cases), ""favor chronic lymphocytic leukemia"" (3 cases), mantle cell lymphoma (3 cases), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (1 case), and unclassifiable (5 cases). Three of the unclassifiable neoplasms had morphologic features of mantle cell lymphoma, but CYCLIN D1 derangement could not be demonstrated. Neither relative expression of CD23 and FMC-7 nor intensity of CD20 or surface immunoglobulin expression was helpful in final classification. The authors conclude that CD5-positive small B-cell neoplasms with an indeterminate immunophenotype are a heterogeneous group, requiring additional studies for final classification.

B5(3) and B5(2) represent steric terms, while pi(2,4) represents the hydrophobic character of the substituents on the ring. The strong dependence of caspase-mediated apoptosis on mostly steric parameters suggests that the process is a receptor-mediated interaction with caspases or mitochondrial proteins being the likely targets. Conversely, cytotoxicity studies of 65 electron-releasing phenols in the L1210 cell line led to the development of the following equation: log 1/ID50 = -1.39sigma+ - 0.28 B5(2,6) + 0.16 log P - 0.58I(2) - 1.04I(1) + 3.90. The low coefficient with log P may pertain to cellular transport that may be enhanced by a modest increase in overall hydrophobicity, while the presence of sigma+ is consistent with the suggestion that radical stabilization is of prime importance in the case of electron-releasing substituents. On the other hand, the QSAR for the interactions of 27 electron-attracting phenols in L1210 cells, log 1/ID50 = 0.56 log P - 0.30 B5(2) + 2.79, suggests that hydrophobicity, as represented by log P is of critical importance. Similar cytotoxicity patterns are observed in other mammalian cell lines such as HL-60, MCF-7, CCRF-CEM, and CEM/VLB. The significant differences between the cytotoxicity and apoptosis QSAR for electron-releasing phenols suggest that cytotoxicity involves minimal apoptosis in most of these substituted monophenols.","['Selassie, Cynthia D', 'Kapur, Sanjay', 'Verma, Rajeshwar P', 'Rosario, Melissa']","['Selassie CD', 'Kapur S', 'Verma RP', 'Rosario M']","['Department of Chemistry, Pomona College, 645 North College Avenue, Claremont, California 91711, USA. cselassie@pomona.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Phenols/*chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",2005/11/11 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/11/11 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm050567w [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2005 Nov 17;48(23):7234-42. doi: 10.1021/jm050567w.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenols)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interpretation of immunophenotypic data within a six-parameter analytical space relies on the standardization and validation of the instrument, the reagents, and the procedure. To address whether or not residual normal lymphocytes, usually present within leukemic samples, can serve as internal quality control for fluorescence intensity, 116 leukemic and 35 normal samples were analyzed. METHODS: Eight laboratories participated in the study and recruited a total of 151 individuals including 29 patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), 77 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 with T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and 35 normal bone marrow donors. Lymphocytes were gated according to the CD45hi/SSClo gating strategy, after which median fluorescence intensities (MFI) as well as percentages of positive cells (%positive) for CD19, CD22, CD7, and CD3 were recorded. Nonparametric statistics were used to compare variation within and between laboratories. RESULTS: Normal lymphocytes within leukemic samples do not show substantial differences compared to lymphocytes from normal controls with respect to expression of CD19, CD22, CD7, and CD3. In particular, longitudinal control charts of MFI values for CD3 antigen provide useful information on analytical and instrument performance. CONCLUSION: Residual normal lymphocytes can serve as internal quality control for studies addressing fluorescence intensity in the setting of immunophenotyping of acute leukemias.","['Ratei, Richard', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Lacombe, Francis', 'Jagoda, Krystyna', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Kraan, Jaco', 'De Santiago, Maria', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Bjorklund, Elisabeth', 'Ludwig, W-D', 'Gratama, Jan', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Ratei R', 'Karawajew L', 'Lacombe F', 'Jagoda K', 'Del Poeta G', 'Kraan J', 'De Santiago M', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Bjorklund E', 'Ludwig WD', 'Gratama J', 'Orfao A']","['HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Charite-University Medicine Berlin, Germany. rratei@berlin.helios-kliniken.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

A high frequency of microsatellite instability and evidence of MSH2 loss in alkylating chemotherapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) suggests that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) dysfunction may be an initiating event in disease evolution. Subsequent accumulation of secondary genetic changes as a result of DNA MMR loss may ultimately lead to the gross chromosomal abnormalities seen in t-AML. Homologous recombination repair (HRR) maintains chromosomal stability by the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and is therefore a possible target for deregulation in MMR dysfunctional t-AML. In order to test this hypothesis Msh2- proficient and -deficient murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were used to examine the effects of MMR status and methylating agent treatment on cellular expression of DNA double-strand break repair genes. HRR gene expression was significantly deregulated in Msh2 null ES cell clones compared to wild-type clones. Furthermore, some Msh2 null clones expressed high levels of Rad51 specifically, a critical component of HRR. Such Rad51 superexpressing clones were also observed when expression was determined in monocytic myeloid cells differentiated from ES cells. A deregulated HRR phenotype could be partially recapitulated in MMR-competent wild-type cells by treatment with the methylating agent, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Furthermore, treatment with melphalan, a leukaemogenic DNA crosslinking chemotherapy nitrogen mustard predicted to elicit HRR, selected against cells with deregulated HRR. These data suggest a t-AML mechanism whereby DNA MMR loss promotes the emergence of HRR gene superexpressing clones, with concomitant chromosomal instability. However, melphalan selection against clones with deregulated HRR suggests that persistence and expansion of unstable clones may require additional genetic alterations that promote cell survival.","['Worrillow, L J', 'Allan, J M']","['Worrillow LJ', 'Allan JM']","['Department of Biology, Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, University of York, York, North Yorkshire YO10 5DD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Mice', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/deficiency', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209208 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209208 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Mar 16;25(12):1709-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209208.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody, RFB4, was readily labeled with (90)Y using the highly stable chelate, 1B4M-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Labeled RFB4 selectively bound to the CD22(+) Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi, but not to CD22(-) control cells in vitro as compared with a control antibody, and was more significantly bound (P = 0.03) to Daudi solid tumors growing in athymic nude mice. Biodistribution data correlated well with the antitumor effect. The therapeutic effect of (90)Y-labeled anti-CD22 (Y22) was dose-dependent, irreversible, and the best results were achieved in mice receiving a single i.p. dose of 196 microCi. These mice displayed a significantly better (P < 0.01) antitumor response than control mice and survived >200 days with no evidence of tumor. Histology studies showed no significant injury to kidney, liver, or small intestine. Importantly, tumor-bearing mice treated with Y22 had no radiologic bone marrow damage compared with tumor-bearing mice treated with the control-labeled antibody arguing that the presence of CD22(+) tumor protected mice from bone marrow damage. When anti-CD22 radioimmunotherapy was compared to radioimmunotherapy with anti-CD19 and anti-CD45 antibodies, all three antibodies distributed significantly high levels of radioisotope to flank tumors in vivo compared with controls (P < 0.05), induced complete remission, and produced long-term, tumor-free survivors. These findings indicate that anti-CD22 radioimmunotherapy with Y22 is highly effective in vivo against CD22-expressing malignancies and may be a useful therapy for drug-refractory B cell leukemia patients.","['Vallera, Daniel A', 'Brechbiel, Martin W', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Dusenbery, Katie E', 'Clohisy, Dennis R', 'Vitetta, Ellen S']","['Vallera DA', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Burns LJ', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Dusenbery KE', 'Clohisy DR', 'Vitetta ES']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, 55455, USA. valle001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Binding', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Yttrium Radioisotopes']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/21/7920 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0725 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 1;11(21):7920-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0725.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,['R01-CA36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I study of cloretazine combined with cytarabine (1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, ara-C) was conducted in patients with refractory disease. DESIGN: Ara-C was given i.v. at a fixed dose of 1.5 gm/m(2)/d by continuous infusion for 4 days (patients ages <65 years at time of diagnosis) or 3 days (patients ages > or =65 years). Cloretazine was given i.v. over 15 to 60 minutes on day 2 at a starting dose of 200 mg/m(2), with escalation in 100 mg/m(2) increments in cohorts of three to six patients until a maximum tolerated dose was established. The DNA repair enzyme O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) was measured at baseline. RESULTS: Forty patients, including 32 with acute myeloid leukemia, received 47 courses of treatment. Complete responses were seen at cloretazine dose levels of > or =400 mg/m(2) in 10 of 37 (27%) evaluable patients, and in this patient subset, AGT activity was significantly lower in patients that responded to treatment than in patients who did not (P < or = 0.027). Dose-limiting toxicities (gastrointestinal and myelosuppression) were seen with 500 and 600 mg/m(2) of cloretazine combined with the 4-day ara-C schedule but not seen with the 3-day schedule. CONCLUSION: The recommended cloretazine dose schedule for future studies is 600 mg/m(2) combined with 1.5 gm/m(2)/d continuous infusion of ara-C for 3 days. The cloretazine and ara-C regimen has significant antileukemic activity. AGT activity may be a predictor of response to cloretazine.","['Giles, Francis', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Gerson, Stanton', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Karsten, Verena', 'Cahill, Ann', 'Yee, Karen', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Sznol, Mario', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Giles F', 'Verstovsek S', 'Thomas D', 'Gerson S', 'Cortes J', 'Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Ravandi F', 'Kornblau S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Karsten V', 'Cahill A', 'Yee K', 'Albitar M', 'Sznol M', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Chemical', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Time Factors']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/21/7817 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1070 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 1;11(21):7817-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1070.,,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated other ATP-binding cassette proteins such as BCRP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP5 for their potential implication in chemoresistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: Eighty five AML patient samples were analyzed in this study. First, MRP3 function was higher in patients which had a high level of leukocytes (P = 0.01), a M5 FAB subtype (P = 0.04), and an intermediate or poor cytogenesis (P = 0.05). BCRP activity was not correlated with clinical or biological variables, but high Pgp activity was correlated with the following variables: CD34 expression (P = 0.002), FAB subtype (P = 0.002), intermediate or poor cytogenesis (P = 0.02), and elderly patients (P = 0.03). Second, Pgp, MRP3, and BCRP activities were correlated with complete remission (P = 0.02, P = 0.04, and P = 0.04, respectively), disease-free survival (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, and P = 0.25, respectively), and overall survival (P = 0.04, P = 0.04, and P = 0.05, respectively) in multivariate analysis. The patient samples expressing one or none of these Pgp, MRP3, or BCRP functional proteins have a better prognosis than the patients expressing two or three of these functional proteins (complete remission, P = 0.02; disease-free survival, P = 0.01; overall survival, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BCRP and MRP3 may also be involved in chemoresistance in AML, especially MRP3 in patients with M5 FAB. Additional modulation of BCRP or MRP3 to Pgp modulation may be necessary in some patients in order to improve the treatment outcome.","['Benderra, Zineb', 'Faussat, Anne Marie', 'Sayada, Lydia', 'Perrot, Jean-Yves', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Chaoui, Driss', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Marzac, Christophe', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Legrand, Ollivier']","['Benderra Z', 'Faussat AM', 'Sayada L', 'Perrot JY', 'Tang R', 'Chaoui D', 'Morjani H', 'Marzac C', 'Marie JP', 'Legrand O']","['Laboratoire Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM U736), Universitaire Paris 6 (UMR 736), France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/21/7764 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1895 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 1;11(21):7764-72. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1895.,,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '1YV0492L5Z (multidrug resistance-associated protein 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighty-three percent of patients had active disease at the moment of transplant. That is, 14 of the 23 patients analyzed (60%) had unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain gene (IgV(H)) status; 8 of 25 patients (32%) had 11q-, with four of them also displaying unmutated IgV(H); and six (24%) had 17p- (five were also unmutated). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 47.3 months, all 22 patients alive are disease free; overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years were 70% and 72%, respectively. According to molecular/cytogenetic characteristics, overall survival and EFS for unmutated CLL and/or with 11q- aberration (n = 13) were 90% and 92%, respectively, not significantly different to those with normal in situ hybridization, 13q- and +12, or mutated CLL (n = 7). All six patients with 17p deletion were transplanted with active disease, including three with refractory disease; all except one reached complete remission after the transplant and two are alive and disease free. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 20%; more than two lines before transplant is an independent prognostic factor for NRM (P = 0,02), EFS (P = 0.02), and overall survival (P = 0.01). Patients older than 55 years have a higher risk of NRM (hazard ratio, 12.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-111). Minimal residual disease was monitored by multiparametric flow cytometry in 21 patients. Clearance of CD79/CD5/CD19/CD23 cells in bone marrow was achieved in 68% and 94% of the patients at days 100 and 360, respectively.

We aimed at elucidating the relationship between the immunogenotype patterns at diagnosis and relapse as well as their clinical and biological relevance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were analyzed in 41 children with a TEL-AML1+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia and an early (up to 30 months after diagnosis; n = 12) or late (at 30 months or later; n = 29) disease recurrence by a standardized PCR approach. RESULTS: In 68% of the patients (group I), we identified differences in the immunogenotype patterns, whereas no changes were observed in the remaining 32% (group II). The divergence resulted more often from clonal selection than clonal evolution and consisted predominantly of losses (0-6, median 5) and/or gains (0-4, median 1) of rearrangements. The frequency and number of clonal immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor rearrangements in group I was higher at diagnosis (2-13, median 5) than at relapse (2-7, median 4), whereas it was the lowest in group II (1-5, median 3). Although group I children were younger at diagnosis, there was no correlation between particular immunogenotype patterns and remission duration. CONCLUSION: These findings imply that the clonal heterogeneity in younger children most likely reflects an ongoing high recombinatorial activity in the preleukemic/leukemic cells, whereas the more uniform repertoire observed in older children mirrors end-stage rearrangement patterns of selected cell clones that evolved during the prolonged latency period.","['Panzer-Grumayer, E Renate', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'del Giudice, Laura', 'Peham, Martina', 'Mann, Georg', 'Eckert, Conny', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Germano, Giuseppe', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Haas, Oskar A']","['Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Cazzaniga G', 'van der Velden VH', 'del Giudice L', 'Peham M', 'Mann G', 'Eckert C', 'Schrauder A', 'Germano G', 'Harbott J', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Gadner H', 'Haas OA']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Techniques', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immune System/pathology', 'Immunoglobulins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/21/7720 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1239 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 1;11(21):7720-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1239.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify such potential targets, we used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as a tool for functional genomics in cell lines as well as primary normal and CML CD34+ cells. In a conditional cell culture model, we demonstrate that RNAi-mediated reduction of SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 protein expression inhibits BCR-ABL-dependent but not cytokine-dependent proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, colony formation of purified primary CML but not of normal CD34+ colony-forming cells is specifically reduced by inhibition of SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 expression, respectively. In addition, coexpression of both anti-BCR-ABL and anti-SHP2 shRNAs from a single lentiviral vector induces stronger inhibition of colony formation as compared to either shRNA alone. The data indicate that BCR-ABL expression may affect the function of normal signaling molecules. Targeting these molecules may harbor significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of patients with CML.","['Scherr, Michaela', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Battmer, Karin', 'Dallmann, Iris', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Eder, Matthias']","['Scherr M', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Battmer K', 'Dallmann I', 'Schultheis B', 'Ganser A', 'Eder M']","['Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Zentrum Innere Medizin, Abteilung Hamatologie, Hamostaseologie und Onkologie, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, D-30623 Hannover, Germany. m.scherr@t-online.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65762-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3087 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Apr 15;107(8):3279-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3087.

Here, we addressed this issue by developing an algorithm to mimic the behavior of regulatory networks in silico and to identify the dynamic response to disease and changing cellular conditions. RESULTS: With regulatory pathway and gene expression data as input, the algorithm provides quantitative assessments of a wide range of responses, including susceptibility to disease, potential usefulness of a given drug, or consequences to such external stimuli as pharmacological interventions or caloric restriction. The algorithm is particularly amenable to the analysis of systems that are difficult to recapitulate in vitro, yet they may have important clinical value. The hypotheses derived from the algorithm were biologically relevant and were successfully validated via independent experiments, as illustrated here in the analysis of the leukemia-associated BCR-ABL pathway and the insulin/IGF pathway related to longevity. The algorithm correctly identified the leukemia drug target and genes important for longevity, and also provided new insights into our understanding of these two processes.

Serial monitoring of CML28 mRNA levels by SYBR Green I real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique was performed in 14 patients, including 10 patients with CML and 3 patients with AML, 1 patient with Ph(+) ALL. The results showed that the sensitivity of the established method was at 10(-4) (0.05 ng) level, with interassay variation and intraassay variation of standard samples both below 10%. The CML28 was highly expressed in AML and CML-BP or AP. CML28 level in newly diagnosed group was (6.58 +/- 2.34) x 10(-2), in pre-conditioning regimen group was (2.19 +/- 0.32) x 10(-2), in group that 1 month after HSCT was (1.35 +/- 1.28) x 10(-2), in group that 3 months after HSCT was (4.57 +/- 6.39) x 10(-3). CML28 can be detected 3 months after HSCT in 1 patient with CML-CP and 3 patients with CML-AP or BC. 2 of them with low level (<2 x 10(-2)) survived without relapse, the other 2 case with high level (>2 x 10(-2)) relapsed within one year, 1 case died and 1 case received the second time HSCT, CML28 level decreased rapidly after HSCT, but still higher than 2 x 10(-2) and relapse has taken place. The conclusions was made that CML28 mRNA level is obviously correlated with the development of leukemia. Serial quantification of CML28 mRNA levels are necessary for HSCT recipients, and more informative than a single detection.

By using FCM, the changes of CD13, CD14, CD15, CD11b and cell cycles were detected in HL-60 cells treated with ATRA (10(-6) mol/L), Ara-C (10 ng/ml) and TPA (10(-8) mol/L) respectively. The samples were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot for the expression of JWA, Bcl-2, HSP27 and HSP70 at day 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. The results showed that HL-60 cells committedly differentiated into granulocyte-, monocyte-, macrophage-like cells. As a result, JWA was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner, while Bcl-2 was down- regulated at the same time. In ATRA and TPA group, the change of HSP70 had positive correlation with JWA, and negative correlation with Bcl-2. The expression of HSP27 was not detected. Contrast to the cells from APL patient, the expression of JWA need not be activated by ATRA in advance. In this study, we also exposed HL-60 cells in higher dose of Ara-C (20 ng/ml), and JWA expression underwent opposite trend comparing with in lower dose of Ara-C (10 ng/ml). It is concluded that JWA may play double important roles in regulating ATRA and TPA-induced differentiation and apoptosis in leukemic cells. The JWA expression had a negative correlation between induction and cytotoxic response. The difference of JWA expressions between HL-60 cell and ANLL patient cells would be involved in different leukemia pathogenesis.","['Shen, Qun', 'Zhou, Jian-Wei', 'Sheng, Rui-Lan', 'Zhu, Guang-Rong', 'Cao, Hai-Xia', 'Lu, Hua']","['Shen Q', 'Zhou JW', 'Sheng RL', 'Zhu GR', 'Cao HX', 'Lu H']","['Department of Hematology, The Jiangsu TCM Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing TCM University, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2005/11/10 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)05-0804-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;13(5):804-8.,,"['0 (ARL6IP5 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is concluded that IAA/HRP can inhibit proliferation of K562 cells and induce K562 cell apoptosis, its mechanism may be related with the increase of intracellular free radical due to the effects of IAA/HRP.","['Yang, Ling', 'Song, Tu-Sheng', 'Huang, Chen', 'Liu, Li-Ying', 'Luo, Yu', 'Ni, Lei', 'Si, Lu-Sheng']","['Yang L', 'Song TS', 'Huang C', 'Liu LY', 'Luo Y', 'Ni L', 'Si LS']","[""Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Indoleacetic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/11/10 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)05-0769-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;13(5):769-73.,,"['0 (Indoleacetic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6U1S09C61L (indoleacetic acid)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis rate and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry; the changes of transcript and protein level were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results indicated that As(4)S(4) had significant cytotoxicity on K562 cells. At the concentration of 0.5 micromol/L, the cell viability decreased significantly after being cultured with As(4)S(4) for 24 hours. When the concentration was lower than 0.1 micromol/L, As(4)S(4) had a little effect on K562 cells. The effect of As(4)S(4) on K562 was time- and concentration- dependent. After being cultured with As(4)S(4) at the concentration of 1.0 micromol/L for 24 to 48 hours, K562 cells displayed typical morphological changes of apoptosis. At a concentration greater than or equal to 1.0 micromol/L, As(4)S(4) could induce apoptosis significantly. After 12 hours of incubation with 1.0 micromol/L As(4)S(4), the apoptosis rate increased from (3.47 +/- 0.42)% to (6.16 +/- 0.98%). At the same time, the percentage of cells in G(1) phase decreased from (69.65 +/- 3.24)% to (50.53 +/- 2.86)%, whereas the percentage of cells in G(2)/M phase increased from (9.56 +/- 2.51)% to (12.91 +/- 2.13)%. The mRNA level of Bcl-X(L) and the protein level of pAkt were down-regulated after the inhibition of As(4)S(4), while the mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bad and Bax had no change. Both of the transcript and protein level of bcr-abl had no change after incubation with As(4)S(4). It is concluded that As(4)S(4) can inhibit the growth of K562 cells efficiently through inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. It seems that As(4)S(4) interferes with pAkt pathway and down-regulates Bcl-X(L), which may be involved in the response of K562 to this agent.","['Ye, Qi-Dong', 'Gu, Long-Jun', 'Zhao, Yan-Xia', 'Zhao, Jin-Cai', 'Chen, Wen-Gao', 'Zhang, Bei', 'Jiang, Li-Min']","['Ye QD', 'Gu LJ', 'Zhao YX', 'Zhao JC', 'Chen WG', 'Zhang B', 'Jiang LM']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, The Shanghai Second Medical University, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2005/11/10 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)05-0759-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;13(5):759-63.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the clinical significance of cyclin B1, the expression of cyclin B1 in acute leukemia (AL) patients was measured; the expression of cyclin B1 and p21(cipl), and their cell cycle distribution were assayed by flow cytometry in 136 adult patients with newly diagnosed AL, 10 continuous complete remission (CCR) AL and 17 normal controls; the mRNA of cyclin B1 and p21(cipl), and the proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in patients and normal controls were detected with semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that the expression of cyclin B1 in newly diagnosed AL patients was significantly higher than that in normal controls. For the relapsed AL patients, the cyclin B1 expression was also higher than that in normal controls, but lower than that in newly diagnosed cases, there was no significant difference between the remission cases and normal controls, nor difference between CCR AL patients and normal controls. All patients with high cyclin B1 expression had an unscheduled expression manner, that cyclin B1 protein appeared in G(1) phase, and in some case it even higher than that of G(2) phase. The response rate (partial remission + complete remission) and survival rate in the cyclin B1 high expressed patients were higher than that of cyclin B1 low expressed patients. The relapse rate in cyclin B1 high expressed patients was higher than that in cyclin B1 normally expressed patients. The survival rate in cyclin B1 high expressed patients was higher than that in cyclin B1 low expression patients. A negative correlation between the expression of cyclin B1 and p21(cipl) was observed. Additionally, cyclin B1 protein expression was generally correlated with proliferation index (PI) and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). It is concluded that this study demonstrates for the first time cyclin B1 overexpression and abnormally distribution in cell cyclin of newly diagnosed AL patients. It was considered that cyclin B1 may play an important role in leukemic pathogeneses and can be one of the factors influencing the prognosis of AL patients.","['Ma, Wei-Dong', 'Xu, Shi-Rong', 'Yan, Yun-Li', 'Guo, Xiao-Nan', 'Qiao, Shu-Kai', 'Xue, Fang', 'Gao, Xiao-Li']","['Ma WD', 'Xu SR', 'Yan YL', 'Guo XN', 'Qiao SK', 'Xue F', 'Gao XL']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hosptial, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin B/*genetics', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/11/10 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)05-0751-08 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;13(5):751-8.,,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the treatment of leukemia cell line K562 and its multidrug-resistant cell line K562/A02 by thapsigargin, intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) in K562 and K562/A02 were measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer with calcium sensitive fluorescence indicator Fura-2/AM; expression changes of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were detected by Western blot; morphological change of apoptotic cell was investigated by AO/EB fluorescent staining under fluorescent microscope; apoptosis rate was determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining; the expression of MAGE-3 gene mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that (1) thapsigargin induced the enhancement of [Ca(2+)]i with different extent in K562 and K562/A02 cells, and the enhancement of [Ca(2+)]i was dose-dependent in experiment range. At the same time, thapsigargin induced upregulation of GRP78 protein expression and typical apoptotic changes of K562 and K562/A02 cells, apoptotic rate was also dose-dependent in experiment range. The [Ca(2+)]i in K562/A02 cells were higher than that in K562 cells. (2) in the course of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis by thapsigargin, the expression of MAGE-3 gene mRNA was remarkably downregulated. Moreover, the expression of MAGE-3 gene mRNA in K562/A02 cells was higher than that in K562 cells. It is concluded that (1) thapsigargin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis of K562 and K562/A02 cells in experiment range, and this may be associated with downregulation of MAGE-3 mRNA expression or MAGE-3 gene may participates in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. (2) MAGE-3 gene may possess anti-apoptotic activity, multidrug resistance in K562/A02 cells can be associated with [Ca(2+)]i increase and upregulation of MAGE-3 expression.","['Feng, Xian-Qi', 'Xiao, Juan', 'Nie, Shu-Min', 'Liu, Fang', 'You, Yong', 'Zou, Ping']","['Feng XQ', 'Xiao J', 'Nie SM', 'Liu F', 'You Y', 'Zou P']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. fxqnsm2000@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology']",2005/11/10 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)05-0741-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;13(5):741-5.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MAGEA3 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, this type of AML usually shows some specific characteristics and has a good response to chemotherapy with a high remission rate and a relatively long median survival. On the other hand, some reports also showed poor prognosis in AML patients with t (8; 21), and the associated bad-prognosis factors have not been strongly established to date. To investigate this issue and to further identify the related characteristics of t (8; 21) AML in China, 75 Chinese AML patients with t (8; 21) were retrospectively analyzed. They comprised 68 cases of M(2), five of M(4) and two of M(5) according to FAB classification. The results indicated that Auer rods were observed in 39 patients (52%) and marrow eosinophilia was detected in only 5 patients (6.7%). These patients showed high level of HLA-DR and CD34 expression, while CD19 was detected in only 13 patients (20.9%). Cytogenetically, 62.5% cases had additional chromosomal abnormalities, and the main associated recurrent additional abnormalities were loss of a sex chromosome (LOS), trisomy 4, del (9q) and trisomy 8. After conventional induction therapy, 62 patients attained complete remission (CR) resulting in the CR rate 82.7%. With a follow-up of 1 to 96 months, 19 cases relapsed at a median time of 10.5 months (range 3 to 42 months). The median overall survival was 20 months, and the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 32.3%. In multivariate analyses of prognostic factors, karyotype, extramedullary leukemia, age and post-remission therapy were of prognostic value for OS. Patients with additional chromosomal anomalies had shorter survival compared to those with t (8; 21) only (P = 0.019), no matter which kind of additional karyotype it was. Extramedullary leukemia was an adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.012). Patients aged 15 years or less had a longer survival than those aged more than 15 years (P = 0.045). Patients accepted HSCT in post-remission therapy had better outcome compared to those with chemotherapy only. It is concluded that Chinese AML patients with t (8; 21) had some different characteristics as compared with patients from other countries, a relatively poor outcome was observed in our patients, especially in those with extramedullary leukemia or additional chromosomal abnormalities.

Using retroviral transduction of bone marrow progenitors followed by transplantation into mice, we demonstrate that inhibition of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation impairs competition, promoting the expansion of progenitors that acquire oncogenic mutations which restore cell cycle progression. Conditions that impair DNA replication dramatically enhance the proliferative advantage provided by the expression of Bcr-Abl or mutant p53, which provide no apparent competitive advantage under conditions of healthy replication. Furthermore, for the Bcr-Abl oncogene the competitive advantage in contexts of impaired DNA replication dramatically increases leukemogenesis. Impaired replication within hematopoietic progenitor cell pools can select for oncogenic events and thereby promote leukemia, demonstrating the importance of replicative competence in the prevention of tumorigenesis. The demonstration that replication-impaired, poorly competitive progenitor cell pools can promote tumorigenesis provides a new rationale for links between tumorigenesis and common human conditions of impaired DNA replication such as dietary folate deficiency, chemotherapeutics targeting dNTP synthesis, and polymorphisms in genes important for DNA metabolism.","['Bilousova, Ganna', 'Marusyk, Andriy', 'Porter, Christopher C', 'Cardiff, Robert D', 'DeGregori, James']","['Bilousova G', 'Marusyk A', 'Porter CC', 'Cardiff RD', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', '*DNA Replication', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'E2F2 Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/metabolism']",2005/11/10 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2005/11/10 09:00'],"['2005/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['05-PLBI-RA-0611R2 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pbio.0030401 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2005 Dec;3(12):e401. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030401.

Parameters evaluated were age, gender, with or without administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), with or without hematopoietic transplantation, the number of antibiotics, the type of antibiotics, the highest level of C-reactive protein (CRP), with or without antifungal prophylaxis, the duration of neutropenia, and the number of neutrophils before and after the administration of antibiotics. Logistic analysis was used for statistical evaluation. With univariate analysis, significant clinical efficacy was observed with the use of carbapenems (p = 0.0009, Odds; 4.58) when the number of neutrophils was not less than 500/microL (P < 0.0001, Odds: 14.1) after administration of antibiotics.

One of these mutations results in an alteration of glycine 90 to aspartic acid (G90D), which has been found in both tumor and genomic DNA, raising the possibility that it is associated with an increased risk for cancer. A novel microarray-based technology was used to screen for this single-nucleotide polymorphism in 387 cancer patients and 329 control individuals. These data were used for case-control and family-based comparisons in order to study the association of this polymorphism with susceptibility to lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The frequency of the G90D polymorphism in breast cancer patients was significantly higher in cases (3%) than in controls (0.3%). The wild-type Abeta subunit interacted with the B56gamma (PPP2R5C), PR72 (PPP2R3A), and PR48 subunits of PP2A but did not interact with the B55alpha (PPP2R2A), B56alpha (PPP2R5A), or B56beta (PPP2R5B) regulatory subunits in an in vitro binding assay. The G90D alteration inhibited the interaction of Abeta with the B56gamma subunit but had no effect on binding to the PR72 subunit. These results provide evidence that the G90D alteration of the Abeta subunit of PP2A is associated with a low frequency of breast carcinoma and that the role of this alteration in transformation is likely to involve decreased interaction with the B56gamma regulatory subunit.","['Esplin, Edward D', 'Ramos, Purita', 'Martinez, Bobbie', 'Tomlinson, Gail E', 'Mumby, Marc C', 'Evans, Glen A']","['Esplin ED', 'Ramos P', 'Martinez B', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Mumby MC', 'Evans GA']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, 75390-9041, USA. edward.esplin@alumni.southwestern.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Aspartic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pedigree', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Phosphatase 2']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20284 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Feb;45(2):182-90. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20284.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies detected immunoreactivity against proteins of a human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle type-I (HIAP-I) in serum samples from the majority of patients with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease of the thyroid that can also affect other organs, most prominently the eyes. To determine whether hyperthyroid animals might provide a model for the retroviral involvement in thyroid autoimmunity, serum samples from 32 cats (21 hyperthyroid and 11 controls) and 10 hypothyroid dogs were examined for immunoreactivity with HIAP-I using a Western blot technique. Of the 21 hyperthyroid cats 15 (71.4%) were HIAP-I positive, while only 2 of 11 (11.8%) control animals without endocrine pathology were positive. No significant correlations were seen between HIAP seroreactivity and serum thyroid hormone levels (T3 and T4), age, gender, treatment history, vaccination status, or weight. No seroreactivity to HIAP-I was detected in hypothyroid dogs. An examination of HIAP-I reactivity in feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-seroconverting cats found that 7/9 (78%) animals viremic for FeLV-A showed an alteration in HIAP serology, whereas only 1/7 (14%) nonviremic animals showed a change in HIAP-I serology.

Outcomes in this population have not been studied. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: All patients admitted to the ICU, from January 1997 to June 2003, for organ failures due to newly diagnosed, untreated cancer and deemed necessary to receive immediate cancer chemotherapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For the period of 6.5 yrs, 100 patients met the study criteria: 43 had acute leukemia, 37 lymphoma, and 12 solid tumors. Median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 39 (30-48) points, and median Logistic Organ Dysfunction score was 5 (3-7) points. Three variables were independently associated with 30-day mortality: need for vasopressor therapy (odds ratio, 6.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-19.4), mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 6.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-22.94); and hepatic failure (odds ratio, 7.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-48.27). Overall survival was 60% after 30 days and 49% after 180 days. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was chiefly dependent on the nature and number of organ failures, not on the nature or stage of the malignancy. The 30-day and 180-day survival rates indicate that, in this selected group of patients, advanced disease at cancer diagnosis should not lead to refusal of ICU admission. Moreover, administration of chemotherapy in the intensive care unit is feasible, and although the mortality rate is high, routine ICU admission of patients with newly diagnosed cancer, specific organ failure, and the need for administration of chemotherapy in the ICU deserves evaluation.","['Darmon, Michael', 'Thiery, Guillaume', 'Ciroldi, Magali', 'de Miranda, Sandra', 'Galicier, Lionel', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Le Gall, Jean-Roger', 'Schlemmer, Benoit', 'Azoulay, Elie']","['Darmon M', 'Thiery G', 'Ciroldi M', 'de Miranda S', 'Galicier L', 'Raffoux E', 'Le Gall JR', 'Schlemmer B', 'Azoulay E']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, Saint Louis University Hospital and Paris 7 University, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Survival Rate']",2005/11/09 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['00003246-200511000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ccm.0000181728.13354.0a [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2005 Nov;33(11):2488-93. doi: 10.1097/01.ccm.0000181728.13354.0a.,,,,,,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2005 Nov;33(11):2689-91.

Transformation to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, plasma cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, or Hodgkin's disease (HD) may also occur. CLL patients are also at a significantly increased risk of developing a second malignant neoplasm later in life. One of the most common of these is HD.

Pretreatment (24 hours) with a subtoxic concentration of LAQ824 (30 nmol/L) followed by a minimally toxic concentration of roscovitine (10 micromol/L; 24 hours) resulted in greater than additive effects on apoptosis in U937, Jurkat, and HL-60 human leukemia cells and blasts from three patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. These events were associated with enhanced conformational changes in Bax; mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor; and a marked increase in caspase activation. LAQ824/roscovitine-treated cells displayed caspase-dependent down-regulation of p21(CIP1) and Mcl-1 and a pronounced caspase-independent reduction in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) expression. The lethality of this regimen was significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of XIAP, a nuclear localization signal-defective p21(CIP1) mutant, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2. Combined exposure to LAQ824 and roscovitine resulted in a significant reduction in XIAP mRNA levels and diminished phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Notably, roscovitine blocked LAQ824-mediated differentiation. Finally, LAQ824 and roscovitine individually and in combination triggered an increase in generation of reactive oxygen species; moreover, coadministration of the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine prevented LAQ824/roscovitine-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that combined treatment of human leukemia cells with LAQ824 and roscovitine disrupts maturation and synergistically induces apoptosis, lending further support for an antileukemic strategy combining novel histone deacetylase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Maggio, Sonia C', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Craig, Ruth', 'Vrana, Julie', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Maggio SC', 'Atadja P', 'Craig R', 'Vrana J', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, MCV Station Box 230, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Roscovitine', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/11/1772 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0157 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Nov;4(11):1772-85. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0157.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (LAQ824)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",,,,,,"['CA61774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the broad anticancer activity observed in preclinical studies, cloretazine and chloroethylating-only [i.e., 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine] and carbamoylating-only (i.e., 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-[(methylamino)carbonyl]hydrazine) analogues were evaluated in five murine hematopoietic cell lines. These cell lines were separable into two groups by virtue of their sensitivity to 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine; the sensitive group included L1210, P388, and F-MEL leukemias (IC50s, 6-8 micromol/L) and the resistant group consisted of Ba/F3 bone marrow and WEHI-3B leukemia cells (IC50s, 50-70 micromol/L). Resistant cells expressed O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), whereas sensitive cells did not. A correlation existed between AGT expression and the functional status of p53; AGT- cells possessed defective p53, whereas AGT+ cells contained wild-type p53. Based on recent findings on regulation of AGT gene expression by others, we suspect that silencing of the AGT gene by promoter hypermethylation frequently occurs during tumor progression involving p53 inactivation. O6-Chloroethylguanine is the initial DNA lesion that progresses to lethal interstrand DNA cross-links. Cloretazine exhibited a much higher preference toward the O6-chloroethylation of guanine, as measured by the difference in IC50s to wild-type and AGT-transfected L1210 cells, than 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, which targets the same site in DNA. Preferential toxicity of cloretazine against AGT- tumor cells coupled with decreased toxicity to AGT+ cells in host tissues constitute the therapeutic basis for cloretazine.","['Ishiguro, Kimiko', 'Shyam, Krishnamurthy', 'Penketh, Philip G', 'Sartorelli, Alan C']","['Ishiguro K', 'Shyam K', 'Penketh PG', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Silencing', 'Glycerol/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Guanine/chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hydrazines/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/metabolism/*physiology', 'Prodrugs/chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/11/1755 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0169 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Nov;4(11):1755-63. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0169.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'AAO1P0WSXJ (thioglycerol)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)']",,,,,,['CA-90671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has also been shown to alkylate DNA through an epoxide-mediated electrophilic attack, and this alkylation is greatly enhanced at specific sites by topoisomerase II. In this article, we describe the synthesis of the two diastereomers of O5-methyl psorospermin and their in vitro activity against a range of solid and hematopoietic tumors. The diastereomeric pair (+/-)-(2'R,3'R) having the naturally occurring enantiomer (2'R,3'R) is the most active across all the cell lines and shows approximately equal activity in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. In subsequent studies using all four enantiomers of O5-methyl psorospermin, the order of biological potency is (2'R,3'R) > (2'R,3'S) = (2'S,3'R) > (2'S,3'S). This order of potency is also found in the topoisomerase II-induced alkylation of O5-methyl psorospermin and can be rationalized by molecular modeling of the psorospermin-duplex binding complex. Therefore, this study defines the optimum stereochemical requirements for both the topoisomerase II-induced alkylation of DNA and the biological activity by psorospermin and its O5-methyl derivatives. Finally, (2'R,3'R) psorospermin was found to be as effective as gemcitabine in slowing tumor growth in vivo in a MiaPaCa pancreatic cancer model. In addition, (2'R,3'R) psorospermin in combination with gemcitabine was found to show an at least additive effect in slowing tumor growth of MiaPaCa.","['Fellows, Ingrid M', 'Schwaebe, Michael', 'Dexheimer, Thomas S', 'Vankayalapati, Hariprasad', 'Gleason-Guzman, Mary', 'Whitten, Jeffrey P', 'Hurley, Laurence H']","['Fellows IM', 'Schwaebe M', 'Dexheimer TS', 'Vankayalapati H', 'Gleason-Guzman M', 'Whitten JP', 'Hurley LH']","['The University of Texas at Austin, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Epoxy Compounds/chemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Time Factors', 'Xanthones/administration & dosage/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/11/1729 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0183 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Nov;4(11):1729-39. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0183.,,"['0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Xanthones)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '74045-97-9 (psorospermin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,['CA49751/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine whether a novel bispecific antisense oligonucleotide targeting both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL induces apoptosis and enhances chemosensitivity in androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cells. An antisense oligonucleotide with complete sequence identity to Bcl-2 and three-base mismatches to Bcl-xL selected from five antisense oligonucleotides targeting various regions with high homology between Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was found to be the most potent inhibitor of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in PC3 cells. This selected Bcl-2/Bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide reduced mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, reducing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels to 12% and 19%, respectively. Interestingly, Mcl-1 was down-regulated as well, although levels of Bax, Bad, or Bak were not altered after treatment with this bispecific antisense oligonucleotide. Indirect down-regulation of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, including XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, via second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases was also observed after bispecific antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Executioner caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 were shown to be involved in apoptosis induced by bispecific antisense oligonucleotide. This Bcl-2/Bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide also enhanced paclitaxel chemosensitivity in PC3 cells, reducing the IC50 of paclitaxel by >90%. These findings illustrate that combined suppression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members using this antisense oligonucleotide could be an attractive strategy for inhibiting cancer progression through alteration of the apoptotic rheostat in androgen-independent prostate cancer.","['Yamanaka, Kazuki', 'Rocchi, Palma', 'Miyake, Hideaki', 'Fazli, Ladan', 'Vessella, Bob', 'Zangemeister-Wittke, Uwe', 'Gleave, Martin E']","['Yamanaka K', 'Rocchi P', 'Miyake H', 'Fazli L', 'Vessella B', 'Zangemeister-Wittke U', 'Gleave ME']","['The Prostate Centre, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Androgens/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Prostate/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/11/1689 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0064 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Nov;4(11):1689-98. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0064.,,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied early deaths in a series of large multicenter trials to assess direct causes of death, their predictability, and whether current management strategies have reduced their frequency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 3,107 newly diagnosed patients entered onto United Kingdom Medical Research Council MM trials from 1980 to 2002 were studied. Trial files, final clinical summaries, and postmortem reports were analyzed. RESULTS: Death within 60 days of trial entry occurred in 299 patients (10%). Logistic regression modeling identified beta 2-microglobulin, performance status, and age as the most important predictors of early death, but only with 61% sensitivity and 73% specificity. Forty-five percent of deaths were attributable to infection, which was often associated with bone pain (particularly thoracic pain) and delay in presenting to medical care. Neutropenia was present at diagnosis in only 11 of the 135 deaths from infection. Renal failure was present in 28% of early deaths and was linked to light-chain MM, hypercalcemia, dehydration, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There was no time related reduction in the percentage or nature of early deaths in 1,550 patients older than 65 years receiving similar therapy between 1982 and 2002. CONCLUSION: A tenth of patients die within 60 days of diagnosis of MM. Infection and renal failure are the main direct causes of early mortality, which cannot be accurately predicted by presenting prognostic features.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment blood samples from 84 cytogenetically normal AML patients aged less than 60 years, who were characterized for BAALC expression, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), and MLL partial tandem duplication (PTD) and uniformly treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9621 protocol, were analyzed for ERG expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Patients were divided into quartiles according to ERG levels and were compared for clinical outcome. High-density oligonucleotide arrays were used to identify genes differentially expressed between high and low ERG expressers. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.7 years, patients with the upper 25% of ERG expression values had a worse cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; P < .001) and overall survival (OS; P = .011) than the remaining patients. In a multivariable analysis, high ERG expression (P < .001) and the presence of MLL PTD (P = .027) predicted worse CIR. With regard to OS, an interaction was observed between expression of ERG and BAALC (P = .013), with ERG overexpression predicting shorter survival only in low BAALC expressers (P = .002). ERG overexpression was an independent prognostic factor even when the unfavorable group of FLT3 ITD patients lacking an FLT3 wild-type allele was included. High ERG expression was associated with upregulation of 112 expressed-sequenced tags and named genes, many of which are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: ERG overexpression in AML patients with normal cytogenetics predicts an adverse clinical outcome and seems to be associated with a specific molecular signature.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Edwards, Colin G', 'Vardiman, James W', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Larson, Richard A', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Baldus CD', 'Ruppert AS', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Whitman SP', 'Kolitz JE', 'Edwards CG', 'Vardiman JW', 'Powell BL', 'Baer MR', 'Moore JO', 'Perrotti D', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Larson RA', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus OH 43210, USA. marcucci-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.6137 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.6137 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 20;23(36):9234-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.6137.

However, a number of patients relapse and allogeneic transplantation following conditioning with chemotherapy and radiotherapy offers the possibility of long-term survival in a proportion of these patients. A significant number of patients with ALL develop disease that is refractory to further therapy. The infusion of unmodified donor lymphocytes (DLI) following relapse after allogeneic transplantation has been shown to be curative in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). However, in ALL the success rate is much lower. The results of in vitro and limited in vivo studies suggest that it may be possible to manipulate lymphocytes from the transplant donor to produce cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) with increased effectiveness in killing patients' ALL cells. This may be done in a number of ways. For example, some strategies utilise the patients dendritic cells (DC) to present tumour antigens to donor lymphocytes and convert them into CTL either by pulsing DC taken in remission with ALL cells or lysate, fusing such 'normal' DC with ALL cells or using DC cultured from the patient's ALL cells. Other approaches include exploiting the expression of leukaemia-specific antigens such as the proteinase PR-3 or the zinc finger transcription factor Wilms tumour-1 protein (WT-1) to stimulate CTL responses. Alternatively, immunotherapeutic strategies might exploit differences in minor histocompatibility antigens such as HA-1 and HA-2 between donor and recipient. These are expressed solely on haemopoietic cells making them suitable targets for donor derived anti-leukaemic cells. In vivo studies to date suggest that educated T-cells may have a role to play in the treatment of relapsed and refractory ALL in the future.","['Blair, Allison', 'Goulden, Nicholas J', 'Libri, Nathan A', 'Oakhill, Anthony', 'Pamphilon, Derwood H']","['Blair A', 'Goulden NJ', 'Libri NA', 'Oakhill A', 'Pamphilon DH']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, National Blood Service, Southmead Road, Bristol BS10 5ND, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Secondary Prevention', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/transplantation', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(04)00051-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2004.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2005 Nov;19(6):289-300. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2004.09.002.

Contrary to KN-CKIepsilon, WT-CKIepsilon attenuated the IL-3-induced activation of Akt with the increase of PTEN activity. Similarly, the increase of Akt activation, as well as PTEN inactivation, was accompanied both by a decrease of CKIepsilon expression induced by all-trans retinoic acid and by the addition of a specific inhibitor for CKIepsilon in HL-60 cells. CKIepsilon seems to activate PTEN by physical interaction.

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is produced by natural killer lymphocytes that interact with the invading trophoblast. This may activate urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and gelatinase enzymes, which play a crucial role in trophoblast invasion. Oestrogen stimulates, while progesterone inhibits, LIF. The role of endometrial contractility in displacing human embryos from the Fallopian tube to the lumen cavity of the uterus or vagina in terms of pregnancy or wastage is still a matter of discussion. Endometriosis and its associated abnormal uterine contractions may be also linked to implantation failure.

Report of two cases and review of the literature.,S35-41,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of malignancies in a cohort of Behcet's disease patients and review the world literature. METHODS: Our database of 128 patients was searched and the age standardized rate (ASR) for cancer was calculated. Furthermore, we performed a MEDLINE search from 1970 through 2003, as well as, a search in the proceedings of international conferences for cases of malignancies associated with Behcet's disease. RESULTS: Two of our 128 patients with Behcet's disease were found to have solid tumors. One male had lung cancer and the other female had kidney cancer. The ASR for cancer cases in our population was investigated and it was found to be 1,600 per 100,000 in 10 years. The ASR for cancer cases in Greece according to WHO is 272.51 per 100,000 per year and therefore 2,725 per 100,000 in 10 years. In the world literature 112 cases of malignancies associated with Behcet's disease were found: Sixty five cases were of male patients and 46 of female with 1 case of unknown gender. The solid malignancies associated with Behcet's disease included cases of bladder, breast, uterus, thyroid and stomach cancer, whereas haematological malignancies included leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease and lymphosarcoma. The treatment administered in these patients with their disease is also reported. CONCLUSION: The age standardized rate of cancer in our population was lower than that of the general population in Greece, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, there is discrepancy in the world literature and the possibility of development of malignancies in Behcet's disease patients should not be ignored.","['Kaklamani, V G', 'Tzonou, A', 'Kaklamanis, P G']","['Kaklamani VG', 'Tzonou A', 'Kaklamanis PG']","['Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, USA.

T-cells from cord blood that had been stimulated by different stimulators (IL-2, PHA, CML cells, K562 cells and bcr-abl peptide) were amplified in vitro by liquid T-cell culture and the mixed lymphocyte and tumor cell culture (MLTC) method. By using the RT-PCR, the CDR3 segments of 24 variable region genes of TCR beta was analyzed in T-cells from 22 cases of cord blood before and after T-cell culture, to observe the usage of TCR Vbeta repertoire. The PCR products were further labeled with fluorescence and analyzed by the Genescan technique for the CDR3 size, to evaluating clonality of the detectable TCR Vbeta T-cells. Only a part of 24 Vbeta subfamily T-cells (3-15 subfamilies) could be detected, however, all of the 24 TCR Vbeta subfamily of T-cells were detected after in vitro culture with PHA or IL-2+anti-CD3 antibody. The number of expressed TCR Vbeta subfamilies was gradually reduced by prolonging the time of culture with CML-associated antigens. The restricted expression of TCR Vbeta subfamilies and oligoclonal expansion of Vbeta21 T-cells were found in cultured T-cells induced by CML cells, K562 cells or bcr-abl peptide. In conclusion, T-cells from cord blood may have the potential capability of proliferation in different TCR Vbeta subfamily T-cells, and the ability for restricted expression and clonal expansion, when T-cells were induced by CML associated antigen.","['Li, Yangqiu', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Zhang, Yuping', 'Wu, Xiuli']","['Li Y', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu X']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical college of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245330500226662 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2005 Oct;10(5):387-92. doi: 10.1080/10245330500226662.,,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells after 2 courses of consolidation therapy showed the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome in two cells out of 20 analysed. We retrospectively examined the sample of bone marrow cells before chemotherapy; It showed minor BCR/ABL positivity with FISH and RT-PCR methods. The Ph chromosome disappeared after consolidation chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but the Ph chromosome reappeared at relapse. We postulated that there were two clones, both a Ph-positive clone and Ph-negative clone. At the initial diagnosis, Ph chromosome was not detected because the G-banding method analyzed only metaphase cells, which contained few Ph-positive clones. In order to offer effective therapy with molecular targeting agents, in this poor prognostic disease, it is necessary to detect Ph chromosome before the first chemotherapy and BCR/ABL detection with FISH or RT-PCR methods appears more useful than G-banding chromosome analysis.","['Hato, Akio', 'Murayama, Tohru', 'Nishikawa, Shinichiro', 'Kajimoto, Kazuyoshi', 'Gomyo, Hiroshi', 'Sugimoto, Takeshi', 'Mizuno, Ishikazu', 'Koizumi, Tamio']","['Hato A', 'Murayama T', 'Nishikawa S', 'Kajimoto K', 'Gomyo H', 'Sugimoto T', 'Mizuno I', 'Koizumi T']","['Hematology/Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Hyogo Medical Center for Adults, Akashi, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemic Infiltration/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",2005/11/09 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/11/09 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245330500226787 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2005 Oct;10(5):379-81. doi: 10.1080/10245330500226787.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The post transplant course was complicated by PRCA. She presented on day +75 with fever, followed by rapid enlargement of tonsils, and a cluster of lymph nodes in the cervical and submandibular regions. A cervical lymph node biopsy revealed the histopathologic findings consistent with PTLD. The immunoblasts were shown to contain EBV viral genomic DNA by PCR, and immunocytochemistry study for the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr encoded RNAs1 (EBER1) were both positive. She responded rapidly to Rituximab and achieved complete resolution of clinical findings and symptoms of both EBV-PTLD and PRCA. CONCLUSION: EBV-PTLD may occur with increasing frequency due to the increasing numbers of transplant recipients, transplant physician should be aware of this life-threatening complication.

In previous studies, we identified two novel proteins, zfBLP1 and zfMcl-1a, which are similar to those of the Bcl-2 family as a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that regulate cellular anti-apoptosis. To evaluate the effect of dysregulated hepatocyte apoptosis during zebrafish hepatogenesis, we demonstrate the transgenic overexpression of either zfBLP1 or zfMcl-1a in zebrafish larval liver. Results showed that 18%-43% of larvae overexpressed zfBLP1 and that 16%-37% of larvae overexpressed zfMc1-1a in the liver leading to liver hyperplasia in 5-day postfertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae. Histologically, zebrafish larvae exhibiting liver hyperplasia displayed a normal type of hepatocyte and the same cell numbers in their two liver buds compared with only one liver bud of wild-type larvae. Of interest, the expression of cyclin genes (A2, B, D1, and E), hepatocyte nuclear factor genes (HNF-1alpha, beta, -3beta, and 4alpha), and oncogenic markers (P53, c-myc, beta-catenin, N-ras, and gankyrin) were up-regulated, while the expression of C/EBP-alpha was down-regulated in a zfMcl-1a-mediated anti-apoptotic process of the liver. Increased cell death and proliferation was found in both hepatic cells of zebrafish larvae overexpressing either zfBLP1 or zfMcl-1a. However, those zebrafish larvae with liver hyperplasia only lived approximately 10 days. (This finding may have been due to liver abnormalities that led to failure of liver function.) In conclusion, transgenic overexpression of zfBLP1 or zfMcl-1a in zebrafish larvae interrupts regulation of the homeostatic balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death during hepatogenesis and leads to liver hyperplasia.","['Her, Guor Mour', 'Cheng, Chih-Hung', 'Hong, Jiann-Ruey', 'Sundaram, Gnanapackiam Sheela', 'Wu, Jen-Leih']","['Her GM', 'Cheng CH', 'Hong JR', 'Sundaram GS', 'Wu JL']","['Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan. gmher@mail.ntou.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', '*Homeostasis', 'Hyperplasia/embryology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Larva/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/embryology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Zebrafish/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/dvdy.20624 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2006 Feb;235(2):515-23. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.20624.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (bcl2l1 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (mcl1a protein, zebrafish)']",,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical studies have demonstrated that decitabine has activity in patients with MDS. Preliminary results of a phase III multicenter North American trial comparing low-dose decitabine to supportive care verified that therapy with decitabine resulted in higher response rates, improved quality of life, and prolonged time to leukemic transformation and/or death. However, further elucidation of its mechanism of action is required, as clinical response to decitabine does not correlate with demethylation of the p15 gene promoter or the repetitive DNA element LINE. Decitabine appears to upregulate both hypermethylated and nonmethylated genes. Ongoing studies aim to determine the optimal dose, schedule, and route of administration of decitabine, and to evaluate whether efficacy can be improved by using it in combination with other agents, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors.","['Yee, Karen W L', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Yee KW', 'Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Giles FJ']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'North America', 'Valproic Acid/administration & dosage']",2005/11/08 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0019-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Dec;84 Suppl 1:18-24. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0019-7.,,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HDAC inhibitors enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in leukemia cells (HL60, Jurkat, K562, and U937) through multiple mechanisms; up-regulation of DR4, DR5, Bak, Bax, Bim, Noxa and PUMA, down-regulation of IAPs, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and cFLIP, release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO and Omi/Htr2) to the cytosol, induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1, activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The sequential treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors followed by TRAIL was more effective in inducing apoptosis than the concurrent treatment or single agent alone. The up-regulation of death receptors and inhibition of cFLIP by HDAC inhibitors will increase the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis, due to enhance activation of caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, and release of mitochondrial proteins to the cytosol, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Thus, the combination of HDAC inhibitors and TRAIL can be used as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of leukemia.","['Shankar, Sharmila', 'Singh, Thiyam R', 'Fandy, Tamer E', 'Luetrakul, Thitidaj', 'Ross, Douglas D', 'Srivastava, Rakesh K']","['Shankar S', 'Singh TR', 'Fandy TE', 'Luetrakul T', 'Ross DD', 'Srivastava RK']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201-1180, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 Dec;16(6):1125-38.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, several types of cancer cells display a low sensitivity to TRAIL or are completely resistant to this pro-apoptotic cytokine. TRAIL signalling is dependent on four receptors. Two of them, death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and DR5), induce apoptosis, whereas decoy receptors 1 and 2 (DcR1 and DcR2) are unable to evoke cell death upon TRAIL binding. TRAIL resistance may be related to the expression of TRAIL decoy receptors. TRAIL has been proposed as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of haematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Surprisingly, however, very limited information is available concerning the expression of TRAIL receptors in AML blasts. Here, we have evaluated, using flow cytometry, TRAIL receptor surface expression and sensitivity to TRAIL-dependent apoptosis of AML blasts from 30 patients. We observed frequent expression of TRAIL DcR1 and DcR2, while expression of DR4 and DR5 was less frequent. Nevertheless, the expression of DR4 or DR5 in leukaemic cells was always matched by a similar expression of one of the decoy receptors. Leukaemic blasts were invariably resistant, even to a high concentration (1000 ng/ml) of TRAIL. We suggest that AML blasts are resistant to TRAIL apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, it is unlikely that TRAIL alone might be used in the future as an innovative pharmacological agent for the treatment of AML.","['Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Mantovani, Irina', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Grafone, Tiziana', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Cappellini A', 'Mantovani I', 'Tazzari PL', 'Grafone T', 'Martinelli G', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Motorie e della Salute, Sezione di Anatomia, Universita di Cassino, 03043 Cassino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*analysis/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 Dec;16(6):1041-8.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on the first long-term treatment of two cancer patients with ART in combination with standard chemotherapy. These patients with metastatic uveal melanoma were treated on a compassionate-use basis, after standard chemotherapy alone was ineffective in stopping tumor growth. The therapy-regimen was well tolerated with no additional side effects other than those caused by standard chemotherapy alone. One patient experienced a temporary response after the addition of ART to Fotemustine while the disease was progressing under therapy with Fotemustine alone. The second patient first experienced a stabilization of the disease after the addition of ART to Dacarbazine, followed by objective regressions of splenic and lung metastases. This patient is still alive 47 months after first diagnosis of stage IV uveal melanoma, a situation with a median survival of 2-5 months.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that CLA isomers are capable of inhibiting the growth of a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro; however, their modulatory effects on the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells remain poorly understood. In the present study, CLA was shown to inhibit the proliferation of murine myeloid leukemia WEHI-3B JCS cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological, flow cytometric and functional analyses revealed that CLA induced the differentiation of WEHI-3B JCS cells into matured macrophage-like cells, as indicated by increases in the cytoplasm:nucleus ratio and vacuolation, the expression of macrophage differentiation antigens (Mac-1 and F4/80) and the enhanced monocytic serine esterase activity of CLA-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that CLA up-regulated the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IFN-gamma genes in WEHI-3B JCS cells, which had previously been shown to play an important role in triggering the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, CLA-treated WEHI-3B JCS cells had also shown reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that CLA might exert its growth-inhibitory effects on myeloid leukemia cells by triggering their terminal differentiation, which is mediated, at least in part, by modulation of the cytokine gene expression in the leukemia cells.","['Lui, Oi-Lan', 'Mak, Nai-Ki', 'Leung, Kwok-Nam']","['Lui OL', 'Mak NK', 'Leung KN']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, P.R.

Recent advances in the molecular genetics of breast cancer have identified various genes associated with tumorigenesis. There is evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. sulindac, have some anti-proliferative effects on various tumors involving altered p53 function. Most of these studies have been performed with various human colon carcinoma cell lines and few of them focus on non-malignant proliferative human mammary epithelial cell lines. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to analyze the differentially expressed genes of the p53 signaling pathway by means of a gene array for the immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F, treated with sulindac. Out of the total 96 genes, only 17 were altered by the drug treatment. Among these 17 genes, 6 showed significant alteration (Q > 2.0), whereas 11 genes showed moderate alterations. Altered genes included BRCA1 associated protein-1 [ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (bap1)]; cell division cycle 2, G1 to S and G2 to M [cdk1(cdc2)]; and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 1 (gadd45), which were down-regulated. However, N-myc gene 1 (rtp), promyelocytic leukemia (pml), and nuclear factor of kappa-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell 3 and p65 [avian (rel A)] were up-regulated.

Furthermore, adhesion molecule expression is attenuated on mouse mastocytoma and human leukemia cells that survive short-term culture in the presence of paclitaxel. In the present study we show that MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells that survived culture for 72 h in the presence of submaximal cytotoxic concentrations of paclitaxel (0.02 and 0.01 microg/ml) showed decreased expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Paclitaxel treatment of MDA-MB-435 cells was associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and the activation of caspase-3. The antioxidant glutathione protected MDA-MB-435 cells from paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity and reduced ICAM-1 expression. In addition, a selective inhibitor of caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK), as well as a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), partially prevented the decrease in ICAM-1 expression observed following paclitaxel treatment, but did not protect against paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that the paclitaxel-induced reduction in ICAM-1 expression by MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells is both ROS- and caspase-dependent, whereas paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity is ROS-dependent and does not involve caspases. Decreased ICAM-1 expression by breast carcinoma cells that survive paclitaxel treatment may negatively impact on cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated destruction of paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells in the context of chemo-immunotherapy or chemo-adoptive immunotherapy.","['Fawcett, Helen', 'Mader, Jamie S', 'Robichaud, Matthew', 'Giacomantonio, Carman', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Fawcett H', 'Mader JS', 'Robichaud M', 'Giacomantonio C', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 1X5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Dec;27(6):1717-26.,,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because agents active in advanced cancers tend to be beneficial in earlier stage disease, docetaxel is now to be assessed, along with hormonal therapy, in the adjuvant setting among patients whose localized prostate cancer has features that put them at particular risk for recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. Data from a pilot study suggest that neo-adjuvant treatment with docetaxel may be appropriate for selected high-risk patients and that such treatment can be undertaken without increasing surgical morbidity. Gene-expression profiling of tissue before and after docetaxel treatment is providing further insight into its effects. A randomized trial, conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, will evaluate neoadjuvant docetaxel in high-risk patients, whereby patients will be randomized to either immediate radical prostatectomy or surgery preceded by hormonal therapy plus docetaxel.

Functional CD70-CD27 interactions could contribute to lymphoma and leukemia progression. This possibility was studied using DNA microarrays on a unique case of low-grade lymphoma/leukemia characterized by recurrent cycles of acute leukemic phase alternating with spontaneous remission. Upon induction of the acute phase expression of CD70 and CD27 in the leukemic cells increased 38- and 25-fold, respectively. Coexpression of membrane CD70 and CD27 on the leukemic (CD5+CD19+) cells was maximal 2-3 days following initiation of the attack. Soluble CD27 in the patient's serum was elevated during remission and further increased in the attack. Functional tests showed that neither anti-CD70 nor anti-CD27 Abs affect the rate of apoptosis. However, the anti-CD70 Ab specifically enhanced proliferation of the remission phase leukemic cells, whereas proliferation of the acute-phase counterparts that express higher level of membrane CD70 was unaffected. Hence, in this lymphoma/leukemia, membrane CD70 is presented on the leukemic cells in a responsive state during the remission and a nonresponsive state during the attack. Presumably, CD70 in its responsive state provides a costimulatory receptor for initiating the next acute phase while its nonresponsive state enables the remission.","['Kaufmann, Yael', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Rosenthal, Esther', 'Hirsch, Yasmine Jacob', 'Many, Amira', 'Rechavi, Gideon']","['Kaufmann Y', 'Amariglio N', 'Rosenthal E', 'Hirsch YJ', 'Many A', 'Rechavi G']","[""Institute of Hematology, Safra Children's Hospital, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. yaelka@sheba.health.gov.il""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD27 Ligand', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/blood/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['175/10/6940 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.175.10.6940 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Nov 15;175(10):6940-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.10.6940.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLDF6 (0.1mg/kg i.p. but not 1mg/kg i.p.) improved not only long-term (24h) memory in adult rats in the water maze behavioural paradigm but also performance in the delayed matching-to-position (DMTP) task (0.3 and 1.0 but not 0.1mg/kg i.p). Hence, HLDF6 not only enhanced allocentric spatial learning and reference memory (water maze) but also improved temporal, spatial and working memory processes in the DMTP behavioural paradigm. Immunoreactivity blotting analysis of HLDF (the protein precursor of HLDF6) was performed and the following rank order of visual intensities from brain structures was noted: hippocampus cerebral cortex cerebellum hypothalamus striatum. Subsequently, we found that the highest absolute levels of HLDF were expressed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex as detected by ELISA. We also demonstrated that HLDF6 enhanced [(3)H]-thymidine and [(14)C]-leucine incorporation into whole brain and hippocampal homogenates (maxima occurring within the range 10 (-12)-10 (-6) M) suggesting that this hexapeptide promoted de novo DNA and protein biosynthesis. We discuss this data in terms of their implications for links with other integrative metabolic pathways involving immediate early gene activation which may underpin a potential application for HLDF6 in limiting memory impairments associated with neurodegenerative diseases.","['Sewell, Robert D E', 'Gruden, Marina A', 'Pache, David M', 'Storogeva, Zinaida I', 'Kostanyan, Irina A', 'Proshin, Andrei T', 'Yurasov, Vasily V', 'Sherstnev, Vladimir V']","['Sewell RD', 'Gruden MA', 'Pache DM', 'Storogeva ZI', 'Kostanyan IA', 'Proshin AT', 'Yurasov VV', 'Sherstnev VV']","['Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Redwood Building, Cathays Park, King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3XF, UK. sewell@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Psychopharmacol,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",8907828,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/*drug effects/pathology', 'Conditioning, Operant/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Discrimination Learning/drug effects', 'Escape Reaction/drug effects', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maze Learning/drug effects', 'Memory/*drug effects', 'Memory, Short-Term/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Orientation/drug effects', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Retention, Psychology/drug effects']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['19/6/602 [pii]', '10.1177/0269881105056645 [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychopharmacol. 2005 Nov;19(6):602-8. doi: 10.1177/0269881105056645.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (cell differentiation factor 8.2-kDa)']",,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of cancer during pregnancy remains a dilemma because cytotoxic therapy has been associated with the presence of severe side-effects. The outcome of children that received antracyclines during pregnancy, including during the first trimester, remain unknown because long-term follow-up is not available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-one children whose mothers (29 acute leukemia, 33 malignant lymphoma and 19 Hodgkin's disease) were treated with cytotoxic drugs, including anthracyclines, during pregnancy were evaluated to detect cardiac toxicity, including clinical evaluation and echocardiogram [all parameters were evaluated, but fraction shortening (FS) was taking as the best parameter to evaluate cardiac toxicity in children] every 5 years after birth until 29 years of age. RESULTS: Children with actual age of 9.3-29.5 years (mean 17.1) did not show any clinical date of cardiac disfunction, in all cases echocardiogram was normal and FS did not showed any abnormality during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The use of anthracyclines did not show any clinical or echocardiogram evidence of late cardiac toxicity. We hope that the present report increases the number of reports of the long-term follow-up of children who received cytotoxic drugs, in order to define the best treatment in this special patient setting.","['Aviles, A', 'Neri, N', 'Nambo, M J']","['Aviles A', 'Neri N', 'Nambo MJ']","['Oncology Research Unit and Department of Hematology, Oncology Hospital National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico, D.F.

PBMCs were pre-treated with tenofovir and infected by exposure to an irradiated cell line chronically harbouring HTLV-1. Measurements of viral DNA, as well as viral gene and protein expression, at 4 weeks after infection, revealed that tenofovir at concentrations of 1 microM and higher completely protected PBMCs against HTLV-1; lower concentrations did not fully prevent HTLV-1 infection of the cultures. Nevertheless, in the long term, cell growth of infected PBMCs was inhibited in vitro even by 0.1 microM tenofovir. In addition, tenofovir directly inhibited HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, in a cell-free assay that utilizes a crude preparation from HTLV-1 viral particles as a source of the enzyme. The selectivity index of tenofovir for HTLV-1, was about four times higher than that of azidothymidine.

Only DOX caused statistically significant changes in the parameters examined. Within 30 min of drug injection, changes were observed in the fluidity of the hydrophobic parts of the lipid bilayer and erythrocyte membrane protein conformation.

Idarubicin, in contrast, caused no identifiable change in any of the parameters studied and therefore seems to be safe for erythrocytes.

Since inflammatory mediators, including members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, suppress proliferation of normal epithelial cells, we hypothesized that epithelial cells must develop mechanisms to evade this inhibition during the tumorigenesis. This study compared the cytokine responses of normal epithelial cells to that of premalignant cells. METHODS: Short-term primary cultures of epithelial cells were established from bronchial brushings. Paired sets of brushings were obtained from areas of normal bronchial epithelium and from areas of metaplastic or dysplastic epithelium, or areas of frank endobronchial carcinoma. In 43 paired cultures, the signalling through the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathways and growth regulation by IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) were determined. Inducible expression and function of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor was assessed by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide. RESULTS: Normal epithelial cells respond strongly to OSM, IFNgamma and EGF, and respond moderately to IL-6, and do not exhibit a detectable response to LIF. In preneoplastic cells, the aberrant signaling that was detected most frequently was an elevated activation of ERK, a reduced or increased IL-6 and EGF response, and an increased LIF response. Some of these changes in preneoplastic cell signaling approach those observed in established lung cancer cell lines. Epigenetic control of LIF receptor expression by histone acetylation can account for the gain of LIF responsiveness. OSM and macrophage-derived cytokines suppressed proliferation of normal epithelial cells, but reduced inhibition or even stimulated proliferation was noted for preneoplastic cells. These alterations likely contribute to the supporting effects that inflammation has on lung tumor progression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that during the earliest stage of premalignant transformation, a modified response to cytokines and EGF is evident. Some of the altered cytokine responses in primary premalignant cells are comparable to those seen in established lung cancer cell lines.","['Loewen, Gregory M', 'Tracy, Erin', 'Blanchard, Frederic', 'Tan, Dongfeng', 'Yu, Jihnhee', 'Raza, Sameera', 'Matsui, Sei-Ichi', 'Baumann, Heinz']","['Loewen GM', 'Tracy E', 'Blanchard F', 'Tan D', 'Yu J', 'Raza S', 'Matsui S', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. gregory.loewen@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Densitometry', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-5-145 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-145 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Nov 4;5:145. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-145.,20051104,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",PMC1289280,,,,,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA037447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although similar questions for the same type of cancer are addressed in these different studies, a comparative analysis of their results is hampered by the use of heterogeneous microarray platforms and analysis methods. RESULTS: In contrast to a meta-analysis approach where results of different studies are combined on an interpretative level, we investigate here how to directly integrate raw microarray data from different studies for the purpose of supervised classification analysis. We use median rank scores and quantile discretization to derive numerically comparable measures of gene expression from different platforms. These transformed data are then used for training of classifiers based on support vector machines. We apply this approach to six publicly available cancer microarray gene expression data sets, which consist of three pairs of studies, each examining the same type of cancer, i.e. breast cancer, prostate cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. For each pair, one study was performed by means of cDNA microarrays and the other by means of oligonucleotide microarrays. In each pair, high classification accuracies (> 85%) were achieved with training and testing on data instances randomly chosen from both data sets in a cross-validation analysis. To exemplify the potential of this cross-platform classification analysis, we use two leukemia microarray data sets to show that important genes with regard to the biology of leukemia are selected in an integrated analysis, which are missed in either single-set analysis. CONCLUSION: Cross-platform classification of multiple cancer microarray data sets yields discriminative gene expression signatures that are found and validated on a large number of microarray samples, generated by different laboratories and microarray technologies. Predictive models generated by this approach are better validated than those generated on a single data set, while showing high predictive power and improved generalization performance.","['Warnat, Patrick', 'Eils, Roland', 'Brors, Benedikt']","['Warnat P', 'Eils R', 'Brors B']","['Department of Theoretical Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. p.warnat@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/03/23 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-6-265 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-6-265 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 4;6:265. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-6-265.,20051104,,PMC1312314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present paper was to describe the authors' experience of two CD117+ DLBCL (one of follicle center-cell origin and one nasal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- plasmablastic lymphoma associated with lytic bone lesions), as determined by tissue immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The CD117 expression in DLBCL was further evaluated using tissue microarrays and seven additional plasmablastic lymphomas, using two commercially available anti-CD117 antibodies (Ab-1, Oncogene and A4502, DakoCytomation). Membranous +/- cytoplasmic staining was seen with Ab-1 in 24/65 (37%) DLBCL, including 21/56 microarray DLBCL, two index cases, and 1/7 additional plasmablastic lymphomas, with persistent staining in 13% of microarray DLBCL despite preincubation with KIT peptide. However, A4502 had only membranous staining of the index cases and one additional EBV- plasmablastic lymphoma with medullary disease. The present study suggests that (i) CD117 expression can be detected sporadically in DLBCL of follicle center-cell origin and a subset of plasmablastic lymphomas; (ii) staining for CD117 might help in identifying EBV- plasmablastic lymphomas associated with bone marrow involvement; and (iii) CD117 antibodies should be carefully validated prior to use, because non-specific staining, as observed with Ab-1, could lead to false-positive results.","['Vakiani, Efsevia', 'Cattoretti, Giorgio', 'Colovai, Adriana I', 'Murty, Vundavalli V', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Bhagat, Govind']","['Vakiani E', 'Cattoretti G', 'Colovai AI', 'Murty VV', 'Alobeid B', 'Bhagat G']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/chemistry/*immunology/pathology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemistry/*immunology/pathology']",2005/11/08 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['PIN1893 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2005.01893.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2005 Nov;55(11):716-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2005.01893.x.,,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As(2)O(3) induces differentiation and inhibits growth. It also causes mitochondrial damage mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), leading to apoptosis. Mitochondria might be the key target of antitumor activity by As(2)O(3); however, its mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Using two human glioblastoma cell lines, A172 and T98G, we found that As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis in A172 cells but not in T98G cells. As(2)O(3)-induced ROS production was observed in both cell lines; however, the dissipation of DeltaPsi(m), Bax oligomerization and caspase activation occurred only in As(2)O(3)-sensitive A172 cells. To determine the mechanisms of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis after ROS generation, we examined the change of mitochondrial morphology. As we reported previously, mitochondrial aggregation occurs before cytochrome c release during apoptosis, thus playing a role in cell death progression. We observed mitochondrial aggregation in As(2)O(3)-sensitive A172 cells but not in T98G cells treated with As(2)O(3). Using laser scanning cytometry, we quantitatively confirmed the results, which indicate that mitochondrial aggregation plays an important role in regulating sensitivity to As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. We propose a sequential process involving ROS generation, mitochondrial aggregation, Bax oligomerization and DeltaPsi(m) dissipation, and caspase activation during As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis.","['Haga, Naomi', 'Fujita, Naoya', 'Tsuruo, Takashi']","['Haga N', 'Fujita N', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glioblastoma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00114.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2005 Nov;96(11):825-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00114.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of four cases.,374-8,"Central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis remains a daunting diagnosis. This opportunistic mycosis historically carries a mortality rate approaching 100% in immunocompromised patients, with death ensuing within days after the onset of neurological symptoms. From their literature review, the authors concluded that children contracting CNS aspergillosis while undergoing systemic chemotherapy for leukemias represent a particularly unfortunate prognostic group. Antifungal medications prove ineffective for treating CNS aspergillosis in patients immunocompromised because of their chemotherapy regimens. In contrast, withholding chemotherapy to reverse immunosuppression, thereby improving the efficacy of antifungal medications, allows for progression of the primary leukemic disease. The authors present a series of four immunosuppressed patients whose course of treatment for leukemia was complicated by CNS Aspergillus sp. abscesses. Multiple cerebral fungal abscesses developed in two patients and a single cerebral abscess developed in two. All four patients underwent frameless stereotactic resection of the aspergilloma. All children later experienced resolution of their CNS infections and full neurological recovery. At 2- to 4-year follow ups, one patient has died of leukemia and the other three continue to thrive without evidence of recurrent aspergillosis. Given the grave natural history cited in the literature for this disease when medical treatment is instituted alone, the authors stress the crucial role of stereotactic neurosurgery for the intelligent treatment of immunocompromised children suspected of harboring a CNS aspergilloma abscesses. The authors propose that the goal for successful treatment in these patients should be gross-total resection of the abscess, its wall, and its capsule.","['Middelhof, Charles A', 'Loudon, William G', 'Muhonen, Michael D', 'Xavier, Christopher', 'Greene, Clarence S Jr']","['Middelhof CA', 'Loudon WG', 'Muhonen MD', 'Xavier C', 'Greene CS Jr']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, Irvine, USA. neurodock@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Diseases/*mortality/*surgery', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neuroaspergillosis/*mortality/*surgery', '*Stereotaxic Techniques']",2005/11/08 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/ped.2005.103.4.0374 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2005 Oct;103(4 Suppl):374-8. doi: 10.3171/ped.2005.103.4.0374.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, but not differentiation, in HL-60 cells. IFN-alpha enhanced TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. We also investigated the expression of c-Myc and Bcl-2 oncoproteins, which are implicated in the survival or death of a cell. The levels of c-Myc protein expression were not changed by IFN-alpha alone at 24hrs of treatment, but were down-regulated at 72 hrs, accompanied by the appearance of apoptotic cells. While, IFN-alpha did not affect the level of Bcl-2 protein expression during this cultivation time. Interestingly, a combination treatment of IFN-alpha with TNF-alpha showed a greater decrease of c-Myc expression than TNF-a alone at 24hrs. Whereas, IFN-alpha did not significantly modulate Bcl-2 expression levels which were down-regulated by TNF-alpha. Therefore, the enhancement of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis by IFN-a might be closely associated with the greater down-regulation of c-Myc protein, rather than Bcl-2. In contrast, with rapid down-regulation of c-Myc expression caused by TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha down-regulated c-Myc rather late (at 72 hrs), suggesting that both cytokines have a distinct pathway regulating c-Myc protein expression. However, the enhancement of apoptosis in the combination treatment would suggest the presence of a common signaling pathway for induction of apoptosis at down-stream of c-Myc.","['Nakashima, A', 'Kumakura, S', 'Mishima, S', 'Ishikura, H', 'Kobayashi, S']","['Nakashima A', 'Kumakura S', 'Mishima S', 'Ishikura H', 'Kobayashi S']","['Dept. of Neurology, Hematology & Rheumatology, University Hospital School of Medicine, Shimane University Izumo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep;24(3):447-56.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carvedilol or captopril were applied on malignant cells at 0.1, 1, 5, 10 and 50 micromol. Cell survival was determined 48 hrs after drugs action by MTT. On all cell lines tested, carvedilol was a very potent inhibitor of cell proliferation. The order of sensitivity of various human cell lines to carvedilol's antiproliferative action was: myelogenous leukemia K562 (IC50 = 22.66 +/- 2.14 micromol), > cervix carcinoma HeLa (IC50 = 30.56 +/- 5.16 micromol), > melanoma Fem-x (IC50 = 32.17 +/- 5.75 micromol), > breast tumor MDA-MB-361 (IC50 = 35.04 +/- 2.95 micromol). In contrast, captopril, used in doses from 0.1-50 micromol, was ineffective (IC50 > 50 micromol) to the same cell lines. It is important to note that captopril in concentrations > 1 micromol led to a statistically significant increase in the percent of survived melanoma Fem-x cells (p < 0.05). Understanding the action of these established and clinically accepted agents could provide a basis for design of improved therapeutic regimens in the treatment of cancer diseases.","['Stanojkovic, T P', 'Zizak, Z', 'Mihailovic-Stanojevic, N', 'Petrovic, T', 'Juranic, Z']","['Stanojkovic TP', 'Zizak Z', 'Mihailovic-Stanojevic N', 'Petrovic T', 'Juranic Z']","['Dept. of Experimental Oncology, Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro. tanjast@lycos.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Captopril/*pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Carvedilol', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Propanolamines/*pharmacology']",2005/11/08 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep;24(3):387-95.,,"['0 (Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists)', '0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Propanolamines)', '0K47UL67F2 (Carvedilol)', '9G64RSX1XD (Captopril)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using the cDNA microarray technology, B-CLL samples were found to overexpress receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), as compared to normal CD19(+) B cells. These findings were validated at the protein level by Western blot and flow cytometry analyses. Moreover, unlike primary normal B cells, leukemic B-CLL cells showed surface expression of RANK, the cognate transmembrane receptor of RANKL. When added in vitro to B-CLL cultures, either alone or in association with chlorambucil or fludarabine, recombinant RANKL did not significantly modulate cell viability, and it minimally affected the IL-8 expression/release. On the other hand, treatment with RANK-Fc chimera potently upregulated the release of IL-8 in the B-CLL culture supernatants, suggesting involvement of reverse signaling through transmembrane RANKL in IL-8 induction. In turn, exposure of B-CLL cells to recombinant IL-8 significantly decreased spontaneous apoptosis as well as chlorambucil- and fludarabine-mediated cytoxicity in B-CLL cells. Since IL-8 has been implicated in progression of B-CLL disease, our findings suggest that, by upregulating IL-8, the RANKL/RANK system may contribute to the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Secchiero, Paola', 'Corallini, Federica', 'Barbarotto, Elisa', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'di Iasio, Maria Grazia', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Secchiero P', 'Corallini F', 'Barbarotto E', 'Melloni E', 'di Iasio MG', 'Tiribelli M', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteoprotegerin', 'RANK Ligand', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/06/06 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20547 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2006 Apr;207(1):158-64. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20547.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Osteoprotegerin)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF11B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic criteria are derived from canine studies and to our knowledge, have not been critically reviewed for cats. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings in cats with multiple myeloma and appraise diagnostic criteria. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of medical records was performed. Inclusion required an antemortem diagnosis of multiple myeloma using 2 of 4 criteria: 1) >or=20% plasma cells in the bone marrow, or >or=10% if atypical plasma cells; 2) paraproteinemia; 3) radiographically-evident osteolysis; 4) light chain proteinuria. Alternatively, a postmortem diagnosis was based on the findings of multiple plasma cell neoplasms, with marrow involvement. RESULTS: Sixteen cats were diagnosed with multiple myeloma between 1996 and 2004, with a median age of 14.0 years; 9 of 16 (56%) were castrated males, and 7 of 16 (44%) were spayed females. Laboratory abnormalities included hyperglobulinemia (14/16, 87.5%), with 11/14 (78.5%) monoclonal and 3/14 (21.4%) biclonal gammopathies; hypoalbuminemia (4/16, 25%); light chain proteinuria, (4/9, 44.4%); hypocholesterolemia (11/16, 68.7%); hypercalcemia, (3/15, 20%); nonregenerative anemia, (11/16, 68.7%); regenerative anemia, (1/16, 6.2%); neutropenia (5/15, 33.3%); thrombocytopenia (8/16, 50%); and marrow plasmacytosis (14/15, 93.3%). Plasma cells were markedly immature, atypical, or both in 10 of 12 (83.3%) cats. Focal or multifocal osteolysis was noted in 6 of 12 (50%) cats for which radiographs were available for review; generalized osteopenia was found in 1 (8.3%) cat. Noncutaneous, extramedullary tumors were found in all cats assessed, 7/7 (100%), including spleen (6), liver (3), and lymph nodes (4). The disease in 1 of 2 cats with cutaneous tumors progressed to plasmacytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Common findings in feline multiple myeloma include atypical plasma cell morphology, hypocholesterolemia, anemia, bone lesions, and multi-organ involvement. Based on the results of this study, we advocate modifying diagnostic criteria in cats to include consideration of plasma cell morphology and visceral organ infiltration.","['Patel, Reema T', 'Caceres, Ana', 'French, Adrienne F', 'McManus, Patricia M']","['Patel RT', 'Caceres A', 'French AF', 'McManus PM']","['Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/pathology/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/pathology/veterinary', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Osteolysis/pathology/veterinary', 'Paraproteinemias/pathology/veterinary', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology/veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-165x.2005.tb00059.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2005 Dec;34(4):341-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165x.2005.tb00059.x.,,,PMC7527652,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed clinical responses to VPA in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML. Here, we report follow-up data on 75 patients. Of these, 66 were started on VPA monotherapy, with later addition of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in patients who did not respond or relapsed. Nine patients were treated with VPA + ATRA from the start. Median treatment duration was 4 months for VPA and 2 months for ATRA. Hematological improvement, according to international working group criteria for MDS, was observed in 18 patients (24%). Median response duration was 4 months. ATRA exerted no additional effect in patients receiving the combination from the start or benefited primary VPA nonresponders. However, of ten VPA responders who relapsed, four achieved a second response after addition of ATRA. Response rates were strongly dependent on disease type according to WHO classification. We found a response rate of 52% in MDS patients with a normal blast count (refractory sideroblastic anemia, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, and refractory sideroblastic cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia). The response rate was 6% in refractory anemia with excess blasts (I + II), 16% in AML, and 0% in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Bone marrow blast count was the only variable that predicted responses. We conclude that VPA is clinically useful in low-risk MDS. For patients with high-risk MDS, VPA may be combined with chemotherapy or demethylating drugs. If patients relapse after an initial response to VPA, ATRA has the potential to induce a prolonged second response.","['Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Knipp, Sabine', 'Fox, Frank', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Gattermann, Norbert']","['Kuendgen A', 'Knipp S', 'Fox F', 'Strupp C', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Steidl C', 'Germing U', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany. kuendgen@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Female', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Valproic Acid/*therapeutic use']",2005/11/05 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0026-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Dec;84 Suppl 1:61-6. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0026-8.,,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients were treated according to a modified ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol. Retrospective analysis of all types of infections according to the treatment phase and the degree of neutropenia is presented. RESULTS: A total of 610 infectious episodes were recorded. Most infections were documented during maintenance (57%), followed by the induction phase (20.3%). During maintenance, 347 episodes were encountered, with nonspecific viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) being the commonest diagnosis (40.0%). Additionally, 38 of 58 total specific viral infections occurred during maintenance: 16 herpes simplex, 7 varicella, 10 herpes zoster infections [varicella-zoster virus (VZV), 45%]. The majority of bacteremia and fever of unknown origin occurred during induction (20%). The number of Gram-negative bacteremia was 50% of the total (26 of 52).

Fewer infections (9.3%) were recorded with concurrent very severe neutropenia (ANC <100 microl(-1)), although 38.5% of positive blood cultures were documented with severe neutropenia. No infection-related fatality occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the severe infections occurred during induction. Gram-positive bacteremia and Gram-negative bacteremia were almost equal. URIs were the commonest infections during the entire treatment and during maintenance. Specific viral infections represented a smaller percentage of the total (VZV was the commonest pathogen).

In a previously reported microarray study, we found NF-kappaB pathway genes differentially expressed between peripheral (PTCL) and lymphoblastic lymphomas. Here, we investigated the expression of NF-kappaB pathway genes using cDNA microarrays in a group of 62 PTCL and in reactive lymph nodes. We found two different subgroups of PTCL based on the expression of NF-kappaB pathway genes. One-third of PTCL showed clearly reduced expression of NF-kappaB genes, while the other group was characterized by high expression of these genes. This distinction was found among all T-cell lymphoma categories analyzed (PTCL unspecified, angioimmunoblastic, cutaneous and natural killer/T lymphomas) with the exception of anaplastic lymphomas (ALCL), which were characterized by reduced NF-kappaB expression in anaplastic cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of NF-kappaB-p65 protein confirmed these differences among PTCL subgroups. Importantly, we found that differentiation between NF-kappaB-positive and -negative PTCL could be of clinical interest. The expression profile associated to reduced expression of NF-kappaB genes was significantly associated with shorter survival of patients and seems to be an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis.","['Martinez-Delgado, B', 'Cuadros, M', 'Honrado, E', 'Ruiz de la Parte, A', 'Roncador, G', 'Alves, J', 'Castrillo, J M', 'Rivas, C', 'Benitez, J']","['Martinez-Delgado B', 'Cuadros M', 'Honrado E', 'Ruiz de la Parte A', 'Roncador G', 'Alves J', 'Castrillo JM', 'Rivas C', 'Benitez J']","['Human Genetics Department, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/classification/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/analysis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403960 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403960 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2254-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403960.,,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these resistant patients a therapeutic approach based on a combination of drugs is more likely to be effective. In the last years, constitutive NF-kappaB/Rel activity has been demonstrated in several hematological malignancies. As a result, NFkB/Rel-blocking approaches have been proposed as antineoplastic strategies. Furthermore, the identification of specific kinases within the NF-kappaB activation pathway offers a selective target to address tailored therapies. In the current study, we show that the IKK inhibitor PS1145 is able to inhibit the proliferation of CML cell lines and primary BM cells. Moreover, the addition of Imatinib increases the effects of PS1145 in resistant cell lines and BM cells from resistant patients, with a further increase of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and colony growth. Our data provide the rational for a new therapeutic approach, which combines Imatinib and the IKK inhibitor PS1145 in CML resistant patients.","['Cilloni, D', 'Messa, F', 'Arruga, F', 'Defilippi, I', 'Morotti, A', 'Messa, E', 'Carturan, S', 'Giugliano, E', 'Pautasso, M', 'Bracco, E', 'Rosso, V', 'Sen, A', 'Martinelli, G', 'Baccarani, M', 'Saglio, G']","['Cilloni D', 'Messa F', 'Arruga F', 'Defilippi I', 'Morotti A', 'Messa E', 'Carturan S', 'Giugliano E', 'Pautasso M', 'Bracco E', 'Rosso V', 'Sen A', 'Martinelli G', 'Baccarani M', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, Turin, Italy. daniela.cilloni@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay/methods']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403998 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403998 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):61-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403998.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PS1145)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, some aspects are variable among APL patients, with differences substantially related to morphological variants, peripheral leukocytes count, the presence of a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, different PML/RARalpha isoforms (long, variable or short) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) mutations. In order to better define this variability, we investigated the gene expression profiles of 18 APL cases revealing, besides a high uniformity in gene expression pattern, the presence of few robust differences among patients able to identify, by an unsupervised analysis, two major clusters of patients characterized by different phenotypes (hypogranular M3v vs classical M3) and by the presence or absence of Flt3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs). Further supervised analysis confirmed that Flt3 status was the APL parameter best associated with these two subgroups. We identified, between Flt3 wild-type and Flt3-ITDs subsets, 147 differentially expressed genes that were involved in the cytoskeleton organization, in the cell adhesion and migration, in the proliferation and the coagulation/inflammation pathways as well as in differentiation and myeloid granules constitution suggesting a role of Flt3 mutations in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of APL.","['Marasca, R', 'Maffei, R', 'Zucchini, P', 'Castelli, I', 'Saviola, A', 'Martinelli, S', 'Ferrari, A', 'Fontana, M', 'Ravanetti, S', 'Torelli, G']","['Marasca R', 'Maffei R', 'Zucchini P', 'Castelli I', 'Saviola A', 'Martinelli S', 'Ferrari A', 'Fontana M', 'Ravanetti S', 'Torelli G']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. marasca@unimore.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Multigene Family', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404000 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404000 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):103-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404000.,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the cyclin D1 and D3 genes (CCND1 and CCND3) are recurrently involved in genomic rearrangements, especially in B-cell lymphoid neoplasias, no clear involvement of the cyclin D2 gene (CCND2) has been reported to date. Here, we identified chromosomal translocations targeting the CCND2 locus at 12p13, and the T-cell receptor beta (TCRB) or the TCRA/D loci in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs). Expression analysis demonstrated dramatic cyclin D2 overexpression in the translocated cases (n=3) compared to other T-ALLs (total, n=89). In order to evaluate dysregulation in T-ALL with respect to normal T-cell differentiation, we analyzed CCND2 expression in normal purified human thymic subpopulations. CCND2 levels were downregulated through progression from the early stages of human T-cell differentiation, further suggesting that the massive and sustained expression in the CCND2-rearranged T-ALL cases was oncogenic. Association with other oncogene expression (TAL1, HOXAs, or TLX3/HOX11L2), NOTCH1 activating mutations, and/or CDKN2A/p16/ARF deletion, showed that cyclin D2 dysregulation could contribute to multi-event oncogenesis in various T-ALL groups.

We recently reported that the BM contains a highly mobile population of CXCR4+ cells that express mRNA for various markers of early tissue-committed stem cells (TCSCs), including neural TCSCs. Here, we report that these cells not only express neural lineage markers (beta-III-tubulin, Nestin, NeuN, and GFAP), but more importantly form neurospheres in vitro. These neural TCSCs are present in significant amounts in BM harvested from young mice but their abundance and responsiveness to gradients of motomorphogens, such as SDF-1, HGF, and LIF, decreases with age. FACS analysis, combined with analysis of neural markers at the mRNA and protein levels, revealed that these cells reside in the nonhematopoietic CXCR4+/Sca-1+/lin-/CD45 BM mononuclear cell fraction. Neural TCSCs are mobilized into the peripheral-blood following stroke and chemoattracted to the damaged neural tissue in an SDF-1-CXCR4-, HGF-c-Met-, and LIF-LIF-R-dependent manner. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the postnatal BM harbors a nonhematopoietic population of cells that express markers of neural TCSCs that may account for the beneficial effects of BM-derived cells in neural regeneration.","['Kucia, M', 'Zhang, Y P', 'Reca, R', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Machalinski, B', 'Majka, M', 'Ildstad, S T', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Shields, C B', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Kucia M', 'Zhang YP', 'Reca R', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Machalinski B', 'Majka M', 'Ildstad ST', 'Ratajczak J', 'Shields CB', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurons/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/physiology', 'Regeneration/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Stroke/*physiopathology']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404011 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Jan;20(1):18-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404011.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",,,,,,['R01 CA106281-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major limitation of autologous HCT is disease recurrence, while the problem with allogeneic HCT is the restriction to relatively young and otherwise medically fit patients because of complications from high-dose therapy coupled with those from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The well-described benefits of graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects have stimulated the development of conditioning regimens with attenuated doses of chemoradiotherapy that may provide both a degree of cytoreduction before allografting (reduced intensity) and facilitate allogeneic cell engraftment through immuno- suppression (nonmyeloablative). Both reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative approaches seek to exploit GVT activity of donor cells to eradicate cancer. Because of intrinsic or acquired insensitivity of some malignancies to standard dose chemotherapy and the limitations of GVT effects in eradicating large tumor burdens, high-dose autologous HCT has been used before reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT. This approach appears to improve response rates for malignancies such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, while avoiding morbidity and mortality of high-dose allogeneic HCT.

Immunotherapy is much more effective when applied at the stage of minimal residual disease, especially against slowly growing tumors because development of graft-versus-leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, or in a broader sense graft-versus-tumor effects renders immunotherapy more time consuming. Hence, eradication of rapidly growing bulky tumors may be difficult or impossible to achieve. Considering the fact that optimal immunotherapy may be accomplished in patients treated at the stage of minimal (MRD) disease, in patients with hematological malignancies and chemosensitive solid tumors a stage of MRD may be best achieved following administration of myeloablative high-dose chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT). Taken together, immunotherapy following autoSCT may provide an ideal combination for improving the cure rate of otherwise incurable cancers, especially if tumor cells may respond to cytokine-mediated immunotherapy or cell-mediated cytokine-activated immunotherapy. Following lymphocyte depletion in the course of autoSCT, adoptive transfer of alloreactive or tumor-reactive lymphocytes may be much more effective due to the preponderance of anticancer effector cells on the one hand, and elimination or depletion of the patient's regulatory cells that may downregulate anticancer effector mechanisms.","['Slavin, Shimon']",['Slavin S'],"['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy and Transplantation Research Center, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. slavin@cc.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology/*transplantation', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2005/11/05 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['88412 [pii]', '10.1159/000088412 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2005;114(4):214-20. doi: 10.1159/000088412.,,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

Mesenchymal or marrow-derived stromal cells, which constitute a large proportion of the non-neoplastic cells within the tumor microenvironment, constitutively secrete the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). CXCL12 secretion by stromal cells attracts cancer cells, acting through its cognate receptor, CXCR4, which is expressed by both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumor cells. CXCR4 promotes tumor progression by direct and indirect mechanisms. First, CXCR4 is essential for metastatic spread to organs where CXCL12 is expressed, and thereby allows tumor cells to access cellular niches, such as the marrow, that favor tumor-cell survival and growth. Second, stromal-derived CXCL12 itself can stimulate survival and growth of neoplastic cells in a paracrine fashion. Third, CXCL12 can promote tumor angiogenesis by attracting endothelial cells to the tumor microenvironment. CXCR4 expression is a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, such as acute myelogenous leukemia or breast carcinoma. Promising results in preclinical tumor models indicate that CXCR4 antagonists may have antitumor activity in patients with various malignancies. Collectively, these observations reveal that CXCR4 is an important molecule involved in the spread and progression of a variety of different tumors. As such, CXCR4 antagonists, although initially developed for treatment of AIDS, actually may become effective agents for the treatment of neoplastic disease.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Burger JA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas M.

Disease resistance can occur if donor T cells are not appropriately activated in vivo. Ex vivo T-cell activation might overcome disease-induced anergy and augment GVT activity. We performed a phase 1 trial of ex vivo-activated DLI (aDLI) for 18 patients with relapse after SCT. Activated donor T cells are produced through costimulation with anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-coated beads. Patients with aggressive malignancies received induction chemotherapy, and all patients received conventional DLI (median, 1.5 x 10(8) mononuclear cells/kg) followed 12 days later by aDLI. Activated DLI was dose escalated from 1 x 10(6) to 1 x 10(8) CD3+ cells per kilogram in 5 levels. Seven patients developed acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) (5 grade I-II, 2 grade III), and 4 developed chronic GVHD. Eight patients achieved complete remission, including 4 of 7 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 2 of 4 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 1 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 1 of 2 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Four complete responders relapsed while 4 remain alive in remission a median 23 months after aDLI. Overall, 10 of 18 remain alive 11 to 53 months after aDLI.

METHODS: This population-based case-control study investigated whether acute leukaemia is increased among children who were in utero or <6 years of age at the time of the Chernobyl accident. Confirmed cases of leukaemia diagnosed from April 26, 1986 through December 31, 2000 in contaminated regions of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine were included. Two controls were matched to each case on sex, birth year, and residence. Accumulated absorbed radiation dose to the bone marrow was estimated for each subject. RESULTS: Median estimated radiation doses of participants were <10 mGy. A significant increase in leukaemia risk with increasing radiation dose to the bone marrow was found. This association was most evident in Ukraine, apparent (but not statistically significant) in Belarus, and not found in Russia. CONCLUSION: Taken at face value, these findings suggest that prolonged exposure to very low radiation doses may increase leukaemia risk as much as or even more than acute exposure. However the large and statistically significant dose-response might be accounted for, at least in part, by an overestimate of risk in Ukraine. Therefore, we conclude this study provides no convincing evidence of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia as a result of exposure to Chernobyl radiation, since it is unclear whether the results are due to a true radiation-related excess, a sampling-derived bias in Ukraine, or some combination thereof. However, the lack of significant dose-responses in Belarus and Russia also cannot convincingly rule out the possibility of an increase in leukaemia risk at low dose levels.","['Davis, S', 'Day, R W', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Mahoney, M C', 'McCarthy, P L', 'Michalek, A M', 'Moysich, K B', 'Onstad, L E', 'Stepanenko, V F', 'Voilleque, P G', 'Chegerova, T', 'Falkner, K', 'Kulikov, S', 'Maslova, E', 'Ostapenko, V', 'Rivkind, N', 'Shevchuk, V', 'Tsyb, A F']","['Davis S', 'Day RW', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Mahoney MC', 'McCarthy PL', 'Michalek AM', 'Moysich KB', 'Onstad LE', 'Stepanenko VF', 'Voilleque PG', 'Chegerova T', 'Falkner K', 'Kulikov S', 'Maslova E', 'Ostapenko V', 'Rivkind N', 'Shevchuk V', 'Tsyb AF']","['Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. sdavis@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radiometry/methods', 'Republic of Belarus/epidemiology', 'Russia/epidemiology', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2005/11/05 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2005/11/05 09:00'],"['2005/11/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['dyi220 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyi220 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2006 Apr;35(2):386-96. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyi220.

The combination of widespread exposures, established biological effects from acute, high-level exposures, and the possibility of leukemia in children from low-level, chronic exposures has made it both necessary and difficult to develop consistent public health policies. In this article we review the basis of both numeric standards and precautionary-based approaches. While we believe that policies regarding EMF should indeed be precautionary, this does not require or imply adoption of numeric exposure standards. We argue that cutpoints from epidemiologic studies, which are arbitrarily chosen, should not be used as the basis for making exposure limits due to a number of uncertainties. Establishment of arbitrary numeric exposure limits undermines the value of both the science-based numeric EMF exposure standards for acute exposures and precautionary approaches.

Unfortunately, these antiblastic therapies have also increased the risk of late complications such as second tumors, especially second lung cancers. Although the role of ionizing radiations in carcinogenesis is now clear, less is known about the damage caused by chemotherapy, immunodeficiency induced by drugs or hematological pathologies, and cigarette smoking. In HD, the relative risk (RR) of second lung cancer increases considerably in relation to the dose of ionizing radiation given to the patient, with an RR of 9.6 when more than 9 Gy are administered. Some studies have reported a significantly higher risk of second lung cancers in smokers compared with nonsmokers ( p = .03). The role of chemotherapy in the development of second lung cancers has yet to be determined. Although some authors correlate a greater risk with an increased number of chemotherapy cycles, others maintain that chemotherapy increases the risk of second lung cancer only if associated with cigarette smoking. Even less is known about the correlation between NHL and second lung cancer. Although the RR is higher in long-term NHL survivors than in healthy individuals (RR = 1.36), the heterogeneity of histotype and treatment does not permit us to confirm a correlation with chemotherapy and smoking. Conversely, in CLL, the development of second lung cancer appears to be linked to the immunodeficiency that accompanies this hematological malignancy. This is confirmed by the identical RR (1.66) for CLL patients subjected to chemotherapy and for those who have only follow-up.","['Amadori, Dino', 'Ronconi, Sonia']","['Amadori D', 'Ronconi S']","['Division of Oncology and Diagnostics, Ospedale G.

The differential diagnosis of the pneumonitis syndrome includes not only infection but also a multitude of noninfectious causes. In addition, the diagnosis may be difficult, owing to the subtlety of the clinical signs as a consequence of the impaired inflammatory response. Radiographic findings are often nonspecific, and invasive procedures and microbiological exams are required to establish the cause of pulmonary disease and to choose a specific therapy. However, invasive diagnostic procedures are often precluded by the poor general conditions and (particularly in acute leukemia patients) by concurrent thrombocytopenia. The approach to all infectious complications, including those of the lower respiratory tract, in immunocompromised patients with hematological diseases, is based on aggressive prevention strategies and the empirical administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials eventually followed by a clinically or microbiologically guided treatment modification. With regard to the antimicrobial treatment, given the variety of infectious and noninfectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with hematological diseases, the diversity of the underlying immunocompromised state, and the spectrum of clinical findings, no single general therapeutic algorithm can be applied.","['Girmenia, Corrado', 'Martino, Pietro']","['Girmenia C', 'Martino P']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Respir Crit Care Med,Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,9431858,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*diagnosis/*etiology/microbiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-922029 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Respir Crit Care Med. 2005 Oct;26(5):445-57. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-922029.,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process is probably influenced by both intravascular as well as extravascular levels of T cell chemotactic chemokines. We observed that native human AML cells usually showed constitutive secretion of the chemotactic chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5, whereas CCL17 was only released for a subset of patients and at relatively low levels. Coculture of AML cells with nonleukemic stromal cells (i.e., fibroblasts, osteoblasts) increased CXCL10 and CCL17 levels whereas CCL5 levels were not altered. However, a wide variation between patients in both CXCL10 and CCL5 levels persisted even in the presence of the stromal cells. Neutralization of CXCL10 and CCL5 inhibited T cell migration in the presence of native human AML cells. Furthermore, serum CCL17 and CXCL10 levels varied between AML patients and were determined by disease status (both chemokines) as well as patient age, chemotherapy and complicating infections (only CCL17). Thus, extravascular as well as intravascular levels of T cell chemotactic chemokines show a considerable variation between patients that may be important for T cell recruitment and the effects of antileukemic T cell reactivity in local AML compartments.","['Olsnes, Astrid Marta', 'Motorin, Dmitri', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Zaritskey, Andrey Y', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Olsnes AM', 'Motorin D', 'Ryningen A', 'Zaritskey AY', 'Bruserud O']","['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Chemokine CCL17', 'Chemokine CCL5', 'Chemokine CXCL10', 'Chemokines, CC/blood/*metabolism', 'Chemokines, CXC/blood/*metabolism', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infections/complications/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/complications/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2004/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-005-0080-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Jul;55(7):830-40. doi: 10.1007/s00262-005-0080-z.

To accelerate the identification of novel TAA in B-ALL, we used a combination of expression profiling and reverse immunology. We compared gene expression profiles of primary B-ALL cells with their normal counterparts, B-cell precursors. Genes differentially expressed by B-ALL cells included many previously identified as TAA in other malignancies. Within this set of overexpressed genes, we focused on those that may be functionally important to the cancer cell. The apoptosis-related molecule, BAX, was highly correlated with the ALL class distinction. Therefore, we evaluated BAX and its isoforms as potential TAA. Peptides from the isoform BAX-delta bound with high affinity to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-DR1. CD8+ CTLs specific for BAX-delta epitopes or their heteroclitic peptides could be expanded from normal donors. BAX-delta-specific T cells lysed peptide-pulsed targets and BAX-delta-expressing leukemia cells in a MHC-restricted fashion. Moreover, primary B-ALL cells were recognized by BAX-delta-specific CTL, indicating that this antigen is naturally processed and presented by tumor cells. This study suggests that (a) BAX-delta may serve as a widely expressed TAA in B-ALL and (b) gene expression profiling can be a generalizable tool to identify immunologic targets for cancer immunotherapy.","['Maia, Sara', 'Haining, W Nicholas', 'Ansen, Sascha', 'Xia, Zhinan', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Seth, Nilufer P', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Cardoso, Angelo A']","['Maia S', 'Haining WN', 'Ansen S', 'Xia Z', 'Armstrong SA', 'Seth NP', 'Ghia P', 'den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Sallan SE', 'Nadler LM', 'Cardoso AA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics/*immunology']",2005/11/04 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/21/10050 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1574 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 1;65(21):10050-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1574.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,"['K08HL72750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of FDC-P1, DeltaRaf-1:ER, DeltaA-Raf:ER, and DeltaB-Raf:ER cells to form tumors in severe combined immunodeficient mice was compared. Mice injected with DeltaRaf:ER cells were implanted with beta-estradiol pellets to induce the DeltaRaf:ER oncoprotein. Cytokine-dependent parental cell lines did not form tumors. Implantation of beta-estradiol pellets into mice injected with DeltaRaf:ER cells significantly accelerated tumor onset and tumor size. The recovered DeltaRaf:ER cells displayed induction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in response to beta-estradiol stimulation, indicating that they had retained conditional activation of ERK even when passed through a severe combined immunodeficient mouse. The DeltaRaf:ER cells were very sensitive to induction of apoptosis by the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor CI1040 whereas parental cells were much less affected, demonstrating that the MEK1 may be useful in eliminating Ras/Raf/MEK-transformed cells. Furthermore, the effects of in vivo administration of the MEK1 inhibitor were evaluated and this inhibitor was observed to suppress the tumorigenicity of the injected cells. This DeltaRaf:ER system can serve as a preclinical model to evaluate the effects of signal transduction inhibitors which target the Raf and MEK proteins.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Shi, Yuexi', 'Steelman, Linda S', 'Shelton, John G', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Marini, Frank', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Contractor, Rooha', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Konopleva M', 'Shi Y', 'Steelman LS', 'Shelton JG', 'Munsell M', 'Marini F', 'McQueen T', 'Contractor R', 'McCubrey JA', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/biosynthesis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'raf Kinases/*biosynthesis']",2005/11/04 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/21/9962 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1068 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 1;65(21):9962-70. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1068.,,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",,,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the feasibility of induction of potent GVL effects by DLI using intentionally mismatched lymphocytes followed by elimination of alloreactive donor T cells by cyclophosphamide for prevention of lethal GVHD following induction of very short yet most potent GVL effects. Mice inoculated with B-cell leukemia (BCL1) and mismatched donor lymphocytes were treated 2 weeks later with low-dose or high-dose cyclophosphamide. All mice receiving cyclophosphamide 2 weeks after DLI survived GVHD, and no residual disease was detected by PCR; all control mice receiving DLI alone died of GVHD. Analysis of host (female) and donor (male) DNA showed that cyclophosphamide treatment eradicated most alloreactive donor cells, yet mixed chimerism was converted to full donor chimerism following transient self-limited GVHD.

Although cell line models implicate somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene as a mechanism of in vitro glucocorticoid resistance, the relevance of this mechanism as a cause of clinical resistance in children with ALL is not known. Mutational screening of all coding exons of the GR gene and LOH analyses were done in a large cohort of relapsed ALL. We show that somatic mutations and LOH of the GR rarely contribute to relapsed disease in children with ALL. However, we report the second case of ALL with a somatic mutation of the GR involving a 29-bp deletion in exon 8 and resulting in a truncated protein with loss of part of the ligand-binding domain. There was no evidence of a remaining wild-type allele. Allele-specific PCR detected the mutated clone at day 28 after presentation, which persisted at a low level throughout the disease course before relapse several years later.

These mutations induce constitutive tyrosine kinase activity in the absence of the natural Flt3 ligand and confer growth factor independence, increased proliferation, and survival to myeloid precursor cells. The signaling pathways and downstream nuclear targets mediating leukemic transformation are only partly identified. Here, we show that the presence of Flt3-ITD constitutively activates Akt (PKB), a key serine-threonine kinase within the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Constitutive activation of Akt phosphorylated and inhibited the transcription factor Foxo3a. Restored Foxo3a activity reversed Flt3-ITD-mediated growth properties and dominant-negative Akt prevented Flt3-ITD-mediated cytokine independence. Conditional Akt activation targeted to the cell membrane induced cytokine-independent survival, cell cycle progression, and proliferation. Importantly, Akt activation was sufficient to cause in vitro transformation of 32D myeloid progenitor cells and in vivo promoted the development of a leukemia-like myeloid disease. Akt phosphorylation was found in myeloid blasts of 86% of AML patients, suggesting an important role in leukemogenesis.

PRCA following HSCT is associated with major ABO incompatibility between donor and recipient and is due to an inhibition of donor erythroid precursors by residual host isoagglutinins. The first patient developed PRCA resistant to several treatment options including donor-derived leukocyte infusions (DLI), high-dose erythropoietin (EPO), and rapid tapering of cyclosporin A (CsA). This patient also received anti-viral therapy as CMV and parvovirus B19 infections were regarded as additional causes of PRCA. Due to a loss of donor chimerism, he underwent second HSCT, but PRCA still persisted. He showed no evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Finally he was administered anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) at a dose of 150/m2 and PRCA resolved in a short period of time. The case was complicated by life-threatening pulmonary aspergillosis with septic shock, successfully treated with anti-fungal therapy. The second case concerns a patient, who revealed PRCA after major ABO-incompatible HSCT from his brother. Considering our experience with the previously described patient, he proceeded to rituximab at a dose of 150/m2 as first line treatment. We observed rapid recovery from PRCA without any side effects. We conclude that rituximab seems to be a promising therapeutic option in patients with PRCA after ABO-mismatched HSCT, in whom conventional treatment fails.","['Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Wojnar, Jerzy', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Wojciechowska-Sadus, Maria', 'Kopera, Malgorzata', 'Kruzel, Tomasz', 'Najda, Jacek', 'Nowak, Katarzyna', 'Holowiecki, Jerzy']","['Helbig G', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Wojnar J', 'Markiewicz M', 'Wojciechowska-Sadus M', 'Kopera M', 'Kruzel T', 'Najda J', 'Nowak K', 'Holowiecki J']","['Department of Haematology and BMT, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland. ghelbig@tlen.pl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Aspergillosis/etiology', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*complications', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Postoperative Complications/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Rituximab', 'Shock, Septic/etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90 Suppl:ECR33.,,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renal biopsy was consistent with MG and appropriate immunosuppressive therapy was prescribed. Both patients achieved complete remission and are alive without renal disease 4 and 2 years after the diagnosis of MG. The normal levels of albumin and non-nephrotic proteinuria in one of the two cases raise the question of whether the real incidence of MG after HSCT is underestimated.

The leukemic blast cells were CD-20 positive and he was treated with systemic anti CD-20 therapy (rituximab) with no CNS recurrence over a six-month period. He died due to a CD-20 negative bone marrow relapse.

Most common presentations are rhinocerebral and pulmonary. We here report the experience of a single center with mucormycoses in patients with hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: Mucormycoses were diagnosed in six patients, (median age of 52 years; range, 26-74) treated between 2001-2004. Diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=3), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1) and multiple myeloma (n=1). Mucormycosis was diagnosed in the neutropenic state following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (n=3) or intense chemotherapy (n=3). Sites of infections were rhinocerebral, facial and pulmonary involvement in one patient each and disseminated mucormycosis in three patients. The diagnosis was established by computed tomography followed by surgical interventions and histological diagnosis in 4 patients and post-mortem in two patients. Species identified were Rhizopus (n=3), Rhizomucor (n=2) and Absidia (n=1). Treatment responses were best if surgical resection was followed by aggressive antifungal chemotherapy. Five of six 6 patients died, all of complications of mucormycosis or their underlying disease. Only one patient with facial mucormycosis is still alive. CONCLUSIONS: This experience demonstrates that patient with mucormycoses have a high mortality rate and early recognition followed by aggressive surgical debridement, high dose antifungal therapy and attempts to correct the underlying immunocompromised state are crucial in the treatment of this fatal infection.","['Bethge, Wolfgang A', 'Schmalzing, Marc', 'Stuhler, Gernot', 'Schumacher, Ulrike', 'Krober, Stefan-Martin', 'Horger, Marius', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Hebart, Holger']","['Bethge WA', 'Schmalzing M', 'Stuhler G', 'Schumacher U', 'Krober SM', 'Horger M', 'Einsele H', 'Kanz L', 'Hebart H']","['Medical Center University of Tubingen, Hematology/Oncology Otfried-Muller Str. 10 , 72076 Tubingen; Germany. wolfgang.bethge@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Communicable Diseases, Emerging', 'Dermatomycoses/drug therapy/surgery', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/drug therapy/*etiology/mortality/surgery', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sinusitis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Viscera/microbiology', 'Voriconazole']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90 Suppl:ECR22.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed factors affecting primary graft failure in recipients of hematopoietic cell transplants from unrelated donors, which were performed using reduced intensity conditioning. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 144 patients whose transplants took place between March 1998 and October 2004. The data were analyzed in January 2005. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 51 years. The diagnoses were varied. Conditioning regimens were fludarabine, melphalan, campath (n=80), fludarabine, busulphan, campath (n=38), fludarabine, BEAM, campath (n=9) and other (n=17). The donor was 10/10 allele matched in 95/144 (66%) cases; 94 donated bone marrow and 50 peripheral blood stem cells. The 3-year probability of overall survival was 43%. The median follow-up was 724 days (range: 91-1651 days). Of evaluable patients, 7/140 (5%) failed to achieve myeloid engraftment. Primary graft failure was significantly associated with the use of a mismatched donor (6/47,13% versus 1/93, 1%, p=0.006), as well as: bone marrow as the source of stem cells (p=0.046), chronic myeloid leukemia compared to other diagnoses (p=0.022), and a female rather than a male donor (p=0.019). In multivariate analysis chronic myeloid leukemia, HLA mismatched and/or female donors remained significantly associated with primary graft failure. Single HLA mismatches were tolerated, however in multiply mismatched grafts, overall survival was worse (p=0.005); transplanted-related mortality (p=0.005) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (p=0.025) were increased. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data have implications for the choice of donor and stem cell source in transplants performed using reduced intensity conditioning regimens, suggesting that the use of bone marrow, female donors and HLA-mismatched grafts increase the risk of primary graft failure, and should be avoided in certain situations.","['Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Devereux, Steve', 'Das-Gupta, Emma', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Madrigal, Jose Alejandro', 'Pagliuca, Anthony', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Byrne, Jennifer L']","['Shaw BE', 'Russell NH', 'Devereux S', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Mackinnon S', 'Madrigal JA', 'Pagliuca A', 'Mufti GJ', 'Byrne JL']","['Nottingham City Hospital, United Kingdom. bshaw@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/mortality']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1562-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since coagulation processes take place on cell membranes, we hypothesized that expression of coagulation proteins on blast membrane could determine the hemostatic balance on the surface of leukemic cells and may correlate with thrombotic manifestations. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia were enrolled over an 11-month period. Twenty-five of the patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M(0-2), 11 had AML-M3, 6 had AML-M(4-5), and 9 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Peripheral blood and bone marrow were analyzed by flow-cytometry for tissue factor, protease-activated receptor 1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and thrombomodulin. RESULTS: Regardless of the leukemia subtype, tissue factor was predominantly present on leukemic blast surfaces as compared to protease-activated receptor 1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and thrombomodulin and it was significantly elevated (mean 63+/-6%) in AML-M3 and AML-M(4-5) as compared to AML-M0(-2) and ALL (mean 37+/-4%, p<0.001). Likewise, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression was greater in AML-M(4-5) (49+/-11%) than in in AML- M(0-2), M3 and, ALL (mean 17+/-3%, p<0.001). Thrombotic manifestations were present in 13 out of 51 (26%) patients. The tissue factor to urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ratio was higher in patients with a thrombotic event than in patients without thrombotic events (16+/-4 vs. 6+/-2, p=0.042). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that tissue factor predominates on leukemic blast surface, particularly in M3 and M4-5 subtypes, while urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is increased on M4-5 blasts. The hemostatic balance on the blast surface may contribute to thrombotic manifestations in leukemic patients.","['Nadir, Yona', 'Katz, Tamar', 'Sarig, Galit', 'Hoffman, Ron', 'Oliven, Anna', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Brenner, Benjamin']","['Nadir Y', 'Katz T', 'Sarig G', 'Hoffman R', 'Oliven A', 'Rowe JM', 'Brenner B']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. ynadir@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Female', 'Hemostasis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Thromboplastin/*physiology', 'Thrombosis/*metabolism/*physiopathology']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1549-56.,,"['0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZAP-70 is structurally and functionally homologous to Syk, a key mediator of B-cell receptor signaling. We therefore evaluated ZAP-70 expression in CLL B cells using Syk as an intracellular standard. DESIGN AND METHODS: The relative amounts of ZAP-70 and Syk were determined in purified B cells from 92 CLL patients using a novel reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure that co-amplifies both transcripts with equal efficiency. The ZAP-70/Syk mRNA ratio was correlated with VH gene mutation status, median treatment-free survival and FACS analysis of ZAP-70 expression. RESULTS: ZAP-70 was expressed in the majority of cases with unmutated VH genes (88%), but also at lower levels in a substantial fraction of cases with mutated VH genes (44%). High levels of ZAP-70, defined as ZAP-70/Syk mRNA ratios above 0.25, were observed mainly in cases with unmutated VH genes and correlated with short treatment-free survival. In contrast, no difference was observed in the median treatment-free survival between patients with low ZAP-70/Syk ratios (0.05-0.25) and patients with no or negligible ZAP-70 expression (ZAP-70/Syk<0.05). In 73 cases ZAP-70 expression was investigated by RT/PCR and FACS analysis; concordance with VH gene mutation status was 86% and 71%, respectively. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: ZAP-70 is frequently expressed in CLL B cells, but only high levels correlate with unmutated VH gene status and progressive disease. Expression of ZAP-70 can be accurately assessed by analysis of the ZAP-70/Syk mRNA ratio, thus providing an alternative to FACS analysis.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'Petlickovski, Aleksandar', 'Rumi, Carlo', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Piccioni, Paola', 'Tarnani, Michela', 'Puggioni, Pierluigi', 'Marietti, Sara', 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Laurenti L', 'Petlickovski A', 'Rumi C', 'Gobessi S', 'Piccioni P', 'Tarnani M', 'Puggioni P', 'Marietti S', 'Sica S', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['Department of Hematology, Catholic University Hospial A.

We aimed at defining whether flow cytometry (FC) techniques can bypass limitations of PCR for MRD determination. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 140 remission samples from 91 patients using both competitive PCR amplification of antigen-receptor genes and four-color FC identification of leukemia immunophenotype. These methods were chosen with the aim of detecting at least 0.1% blasts. RESULTS: MRD was measured using both PCR and FC methods in 123 samples and the two methods provided concordant results in 119 of them (97%). Moreover, three out of the four discordant results appeared minor since MRD was detectable by both methods, but at different levels. In 12 of 13 samples from nine patients, mainly infants with early CD10- and/or t(4;11) B-cell ALL and children with immature T-cell ALL, MRD could be determined using FC whereas PCR failed. Conversely, FC methods were unfeasible due to inappropriate leukemia immunophenotype in three additional children (including two with T-cell ALL) for whom PCR successfully provided MRD results. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The MRD results provided by FC techniques were highly concordant with those of competitive PCR. Moreover, the applicability of FC appeared higher in certain ALL subsets, although the appropriateness of this technique in terms of outcome prediction remains to be demonstrated.","['Robillard, Nelly', 'Cave, Helene', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Guidal, Christine', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Rohrlich, Pierre Simon', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Garand, Richard']","['Robillard N', 'Cave H', 'Mechinaud F', 'Guidal C', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Rohrlich PS', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Garand R']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/classification/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1516-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The C609T polymorphism is very common in Japan but we found no link with altered risk for infant ALL. However, a variant of another allele at nt 465 (C465T, Arg139Trp), also associated with diminished enzyme activity, was strongly associated (OR 6.36; CI 1.84-21.90; p=0.002) with infant ALL, especially in t(4;11)(q21;q23), MLL-AF4. No association was found between this allele and risk of infant AML with MLL gene fusions or infant ALL without MLL gene fusions. The same C465T allele has been linked recently, in an Oriental population, to sensitivity to benzene hematotoxicity. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data endorse the notion that infant ALL with MLL fusion genes have a unique etiology possibly involving transplacental exposure to chemicals.","['Eguchi-Ishimae, Minenori', 'Eguchi, Mariko', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Knight, Deborah', 'Sadakane, Yujirou', 'Isoyama, Keiichi', 'Yabe, Hiromasa', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Greaves, Mel']","['Eguchi-Ishimae M', 'Eguchi M', 'Ishii E', 'Knight D', 'Sadakane Y', 'Isoyama K', 'Yabe H', 'Mizutani S', 'Greaves M']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Variation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1511-5.,,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, balanced translocations tend to be found in younger patients while complex aberrant karyotypes are usually found in elderly patients with AML. However, detailed data on the population-based age-dependent incidences of distinct cytogenetic subtypes as well as of molecular mutations are lacking. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the population-based age-specific incidences of different cytogenetic subgroups in 2555 patients with AML between 21 and 70 years of age. We also investigated the association of specific molecular markers (FLT3-M, FLT3- TKD, MLL-PTD, NRAS, CEPBA, KITD816). RESULTS: The incidence of balanced translocations was rather constant over lifetime. In contrast, the incidence of unbalanced aberrations and especially complex aberrant karyotypes increased sharply with age. There were also different age-specific incidences of some recurrent molecular mutations.

We aimed to determine a predictor of relapse with the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) of AML1-ETO chimeric mRNA. DESIGN AND METHODS: We serially monitored AML1-ETO fusion transcripts using RQ-PCR in 113 bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 21 patients with AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia and analyzed the prognostic relevance of the results. RESULTS: Higher transcript levels at diagnosis were associated with a higher probability of relapse (p=0.038 in all patients and p=0.001 in adult patients). A decrease of less than 3-log at the time of achieving complete remission was also associated with a higher risk of relapse (p=0.035 in all patients and p=0.011 in adult patients). RQ-PCR detected the reappearance of AML1-ETO fusion transcripts in both peripheral blood and bone marrow during apparent complete remission. Detection of the transcripts preceded hematologic relapse by one to three months. The transcript levels in peripheral blood correlated with those in bone marrow at the same time point. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that regular monitoring of AML1-ETO chimeric transcript levels by RQ-PCR on bone marrow or peripheral blood samples could be extremely useful for the selection of high-risk patients and be an early predictor of relapse.","['Yoo, Soo Jin', 'Chi, Hyun Sook', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Seo, Eul-Ju', 'Seo, Jong Jin', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Park, Hyo-Soon', 'Park, Chan Jeoung']","['Yoo SJ', 'Chi HS', 'Jang S', 'Seo EJ', 'Seo JJ', 'Lee JH', 'Park HS', 'Park CJ']","['Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, Gachon Medical School, Gil Medical Center, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1493-501.,,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has previously been shown that resistance to the first cycle of induction chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor. We investigated whether resistance to chemotherapy be represented by gene-expression profiles, and which genes are associated with resistance. DESIGN AND METHODS: cDNA microarrays containing approximately 41,000 features were used to compare the gene-expression profile of AML blasts between 33 patients with good or poor response to induction chemotherapy. Data generated by cDNA-arrays were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Using significance analysis of microarrays, we identified a characteristic gene-expression profile which distinguished AML samples from patients with good or poor responses. In hierarchical clustering analysis poor responders clustered together with normal CD34+ cells. Moreover, 13/40 (32.5%) genes highly expressed in poor responders are also overexpressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Prediction analysis using 10-fold cross-validation revealed an 80% overall accuracy. Using the treatment-response signature to predict the outcome in an independent test set of 104 AML patients, samples were separated into two subgroups with significantly inferior response rate (43.5% vs. 66.7%, p=0.04), significantly shorter event-free and overall survival (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively) in the poor-response compared to in the good-response signature group. In multivariate analysis, the treatment-response signature was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.6, p=0.006).

RNA degradation thus constitutes a potential problem for laboratories quantifying minimal residual disease (MRD). Patients' samples that take a long time to be transported from the hospital to the analyzing laboratory may be subject to RNA degradation with a corresponding loss in sensitivity and possible generation of false negative results. Recently, RNA preservation systems have been developed in order to improve RNA stability. The aim of the present study was to investigate such a system. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the performance of the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit in follow-up CML peripheral blood samples and compared the results to those from unstabilized parallel Trizol extracted samples. The different sample processing methods were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. RESULTS: RNA isolated with the PAXgene system gave a superior yield per milliliter of blood than did the routine Trizol extraction method. However, although of comparable quality, the RNA did not PCR-amplify as efficiently as equal amounts of RNA from routinely processed samples. Therefore, RNA processed with the PAXgene system showed decreased sensitivity for MRD detection, resulting in false negative results. The sensitivity was comparable to that of samples processed routinely 20-30 hours after phlebotomy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that routinely processed, i.e. unstabilized, peripheral blood that reaches the laboratory and is processed within 30 hours is preferable for MRD detection. Optimal results were achieved with fresh samples processed within 5 hours with the Trizol method. However, RNA stabilization may be useful if sample transit is expected to exceed 30 hours.","['Thorn, Ingrid', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Ohlsen, Cecilia', 'Jonsson, Anna-Maria', 'Klangby, Ulf', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Barbany, Gisela']","['Thorn I', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Ohlsen C', 'Jonsson AM', 'Klangby U', 'Simonsson B', 'Barbany G']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/genetics', 'RNA Stability/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic/standards']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1471-6.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired HbH has recently been associated with mutations in an X-linked gene, ATRX, previously linked to inherited ATR-X syndrome (alpha thalassemia-retardation-X linked). DESIGN AND METHODS: A Swiss man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia complicated by various autoimmune disorders and by strikingly microcytic, hypochromic anemia was analyzed for the presence of acquired HbH. After HbH detection, we sought an underlying genetic cause. We used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to screen for an ATRX mutation, and measured ATRX expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The patient had 50% HbH-containing cells on supravital staining. Marrow karyotype and the alpha globin cluster were normal. A clonally-restricted ATRX point mutation was detected in the conserved splice donor motif in intron 4 (IVS 4 +2 T-->C). Plasmid vector cloning of patient ATRX cDNA demonstrated both exon 4 skipping and partial intron retention with activation of a cryptic splice site, both outcomes resulting in frameshifts with premature stop codon generation in exon 5 and near-decimation of ATRX expression in myeloid cells. Normal exon 6 alternative splicing was retained. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Intronic ATRX mutations with splicing consequences, uncommon in inherited ATR-X syndrome because of their devastating effect on expression of functional protein, should be routinely sought when undertaking molecular analysis of acquired HbH disease. Detection of an acquired ATRX mutation can help support clonality in karyotypically normal ambiguous myeloid disorders with HbH.","['Nelson, Maria E', 'Thurmes, Paul J', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Steensma, David P']","['Nelson ME', 'Thurmes PJ', 'Hoyer JD', 'Steensma DP']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"[""5' Flanking Region/*genetics"", 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'RNA Splice Sites/genetics', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein', 'alpha-Thalassemia/*genetics']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Nov;90(11):1463-70.,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (ATRX protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",,,,,,['K12 CA 90628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['RefSeq/NM_000489'],,,,,,,,,,,

The basal and cytokine (SDF-1, GM-CSF, bFGF, VEGF)-stimulated secretions of gelatinases 2 and 9 (MMPs-2 and -9) and expression of their genes were monitored by zymography and RT-PCR, respectively. A wide heterogeneity was found in the secretory capacities of these cells. The basal secretion of MMP-9 was more frequently observed than that of MMP-2 in both cell types. The cytokines VEGF and bFGF were found to induce predominant stimulatory effects on the MMP-2 secretion. In contrast, GM-CSF was shown to exert a more pronounced activation of the MMP-9 production. Experiments using inhibitors of metabolic pathways (U0126, LY294002 and SN50) revealed that the secretion of MMP-9 was mediated through PI3/MEK1 kinases. The MMP-2 secretion appeared to be however, stimulated through a different metabolic pathway. The microfluorimetric approach showed that the basal and stimulated secretions of MMPs-2 and -9 depended on the extracellular calcium pool. The cytokines VEGF and bFGF represent potent factors increasing the intracellular calcium concentration with similar kinetics. In contrast, GM-CSF was found to activate a verapamil-sensitive efflux of indo-1 from cytosol suggesting that this cytokine could be responsible for the activation of xenobiotic membrane transporters. Experiments using the trypan blue exclusion test demonstrated that bFGF, in contrast to VEGF and GM-CSF, markedly augmented pre-B ALL cell survival. Further investigations into a possible correlation between the plasma concentrations of MMP-2 and -9, VEGF, bFGF and GM-CSF, and the poor evolution of pre-B ALL in children could have valuable diagnostic implications.","['Pegahi, Rassa', 'Poyer, Florent', 'Legrand, Elisabeth', 'Cazin, Lionel', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre', 'Lamacz, Marek']","['Pegahi R', 'Poyer F', 'Legrand E', 'Cazin L', 'Vannier JP', 'Lamacz M']","['Groupe de recherche sur le Micro-Environnement et le Renouvellement Cellulaire Integre M.E.R.C.I., Faculte de medecine-pharmacie, Universite de Rouen, 22 boulevard Gambetta, 76183 Rouen Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2005 Sep;16(3):223-32.,,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytological remission is currently achieved in 95-98 % of these patients, although a significant proportion will later relapse. More sensitive techniques are required to measure residual leukemia and establish a new definition of complete remission. OBJECTIVE: To identify minimal residual disease (MRD) by immunological techniques and define its prognostic impact in children with ALL. METHODS: MRD was studied by flow cytometry in 53 children diagnosed in our department between June 1999 and April 2003 and treated using the Pethema protocols. All the children achieved complete cytological remission (< 5 %) with the induction treatment and had at least one useful phenotype for follow-up: 11 % were T phenotype, one was biphenotypic and the remainder were B cell leukemias. Bone marrow samples were analyzed post-induction, post-consolidation, after 6 and 11 months of maintenance treatment, at the end of treatment, and 3 months later. The positivity threshold was set at 0.01 % and the sensitivity of the technique was 1 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-5). RESULTS: A total of 199 samples were analyzed. Thirty-seven percent of the post-induction and 20 % of the post-consolidation samples analyzed were MRD-positive. Elimination was slower in patients with a T phenotype and in high-risk patients according to the traditional classification. After a median follow-up of 26 months, event free survival (EFS) in the group as a whole was 92 %. The EFS rate in the patients who were MRD-positive post-induction was 79 %. None of the patients who were MRD-negative post-induction has developed recurrence. CONCLUSION: Study of MRD is essential and should be included in all current treatment protocols for children with ALL. Its usefulness derives from the prognostic impact of the response to induction treatment. Continued sequential monitoring may predict recurrence before the onset of clinical or hematologic manifestations.","['Bastida Vila, P', 'Palacio Garcia, C', 'Solsona Riera, M', 'Ortega Aramburu, J J', 'Sanchez de Toledo Codina, J']","['Bastida Vila P', 'Palacio Garcia C', 'Solsona Riera M', 'Ortega Aramburu JJ', 'Sanchez de Toledo Codina J']","[""Servicio de Oncohematologia Infantil, Hospital Universitario Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Espana. pbastida@vhebron.net""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*epidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Remission Induction']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['13080401 [pii]', '10.1157/13080401 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2005 Nov;63(5):390-5. doi: 10.1157/13080401.,,,,,Leucemia minima residual: nuevo concepto de remision completa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the US, it is approved as monotherapy in patients aged > or =60 years with a first relapse of AML who are ineligible for other cytotoxic therapy. Monotherapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin results in complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) in approximately =25% of adults (including those aged > or =60 years) with CD33-positive AML in first relapse. Preliminary data indicate a potential role for gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a component of induction or consolidation regimens in adults and, based on an early study, in the treatment of children with AML, although randomised, controlled studies are needed. Serious adverse events, notably hepatotoxicity, characterise its tolerability profile, but gemtuzumab ozogamicin is comparatively well tolerated by most patients. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a valuable new treatment option for patients aged > or =60 years with CD33-positive AML in first relapse for whom other cytotoxic chemotherapy is not considered appropriate; patients with a first CR (CR1) of >12 months are likely to have the best outcome.","['Fenton, Caroline', 'Perry, Caroline M']","['Fenton C', 'Perry CM']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged']",2005/11/04 09:00,2006/02/09 09:00,['2005/11/04 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['651614 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200565160-00014 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2005;65(16):2405-27. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200565160-00014.,,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",,72,,,,,,,,,,,['BioDrugs. 2006;20(2):137-9.

The consequences of this inflammation, not only affect the quality of life of the patient, but can also suppose a limitation in the application of the treatment, as well as an increase in the hospital stay and therapeutic costs. A main obstacle for the study of the mucositis, has been the lack of a system adapted for its valuation by means of the oral examination. Methods developed to measure and quantify the changes produced in oral epithelium as a result of treatment of cancer can be very varied from more simple methods, such as general scales with four or five degrees of severity that link the mucositis to the state of oral health, to specific scales of treatment. In this last type of scale the type of antineoplastic treatment that gave rise to the mucositis is identified giving a global severity score for the mucositis. The establishment of a common scale for the evaluation of mucositis is important, not only for clinical purposes but also for the investigation of the degree of toxicity of the different therapeutic regimes that give rise to the mucositis.","['Lopez-Castano, Fuensanta', 'Onate-Sanchez, Ricardo E', 'Roldan-Chicano, Rocio', 'Cabrerizo-Merino, Maria Carmen']","['Lopez-Castano F', 'Onate-Sanchez RE', 'Roldan-Chicano R', 'Cabrerizo-Merino MC']","['Unidad Docente Pacientes Especiales, Clinica Odontologica Universitaria Murcia.']","['eng', 'spa']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",101231694,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Deglutition Disorders/diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mouth Mucosa/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Mucositis/etiology/*pathology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stomatitis/etiology/*pathology']",2005/11/03 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10489398 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal. 2005 Nov-Dec;10(5):412-21.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected the new mutation of BCR/ABL, resulting in premature termination and loss of BCR/ABL fusion protein expression, which might be possible mechanism for the resistance to imatinib in SR-1 cells.","['Park, Tae Ho', 'Kwon, Hyuk Chan', 'Kim, Hyo Jin', 'Han, Jin Yeong', 'Jeong, Jin Sook', 'Han, Hoon Yeon', 'Seo, Chi', 'Kwak, Jong Young', 'Park, Joo In']","['Park TH', 'Kwon HC', 'Kim HJ', 'Han JY', 'Jeong JS', 'Han HY', 'Seo C', 'Kwak JY', 'Park JI']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University, College of Medicine, Busan 602-715, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Nucleotides/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2005/11/03 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2005103116 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2005.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2005 Oct 31;37(5):507-11. doi: 10.1038/emm.2005.63.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exon 6 of BCL6 contains a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (-195 C>T; dbSNP ID: rs1056932) that alters a potential binding site for an exonic splicing enhancer. We used unconditional logistic regression models to examine the association between this SNP and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in a population-based case-control study of women residing in Connecticut (461 case patients and 535 control subjects). The risk of NHL among women with the CC genotype was more than double that of women with the TT genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 3.3). Higher risks were observed for two NHL subtypes, namely B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia/prolymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 7.8) and T-cell lymphoma (OR = 5.2, 95% CI = 2.0 to 13.3).

REVIEW METHODS: We sought studies providing data regarding the association of breastfeeding and occurrence of childhood leukemia. Studies were identified by using Medline, HHS Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding, US Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, reference lists, and national experts. Methodologic quality was evaluated for each study by using criteria from the US Preventive Services Task Force and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. RESULTS: We reviewed 111 citations to identify 32 potentially eligible full-text articles. Of the 10 studies reviewed, only 4 were sufficient to provide at least fair-quality evidence regarding the association between maternal breastfeeding and childhood leukemia. Studies conflicted regarding the protective effect of breastfeeding on childhood leukemia. In the 2 largest and highest quality studies, breastfeeding was associated with a significant risk reduction in one study with longer breastfeeding duration, reflecting greater protection, and a nonsignificant but suggestive difference in the other. Taken together, half of the studies associated breastfeeding with a lower risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: There are few high-quality studies that examine the potential for a protective effect of breastfeeding for childhood leukemia. Furthermore, the few studies that exist disagree regarding the association. It is estimated that the United States spends 1.4 billion dollars annually on the treatment of childhood leukemia. Patients, clinicians, and policy makers do not have the data that they need to make decisions regarding this important potential preventive measure.","['Guise, Jeanne-Marie', 'Austin, Donald', 'Morris, Cynthia D']","['Guise JM', 'Austin D', 'Morris CD']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA. guisej@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['*Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/prevention & control', 'Risk Reduction Behavior']",2005/11/03 09:00,2005/12/29 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['116/5/e724 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2005-0636 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2005 Nov;116(5):e724-31. doi: 10.1542/peds.2005-0636.,,,,36,,,,"['0990-0115/PHS HHS/United States', '1 K08 HS11338-01/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated performance limitations and restricted abilities to participate in personal care, to engage in routine activities like shopping or housework, and to attend work or school (participation restrictions) in a cohort of survivors of childhood cancer. SETTING: Epidemiologic survey and 26 institutions that treat childhood cancer. PATIENTS: Participants included 11 481 persons who were treated for primary brain cancer, leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney tumor, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, or malignant bone tumor before the age of 21 years and who survived at least 5 years after diagnosis. The comparison group included 3839 siblings of survivors of childhood cancer. MEASUREMENT: Medical data were abstracted, and participants or parents (if the participants were <18 years of age at survey completion) completed a 24-page questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with siblings, survivors were more likely to report performance limitations (risk ratio, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0]) and to report restricted participation in personal care skills (risk ratio, 4.7 [CI, 3.0 to 7.2]), routine activities (risk ratio, 4.7 [CI, 3.6 to 6.2]), and the ability to attend work or school (risk ratio, 5.9 [CI, 4.5 to 7.6]). Survivors of brain (26.6%) and bone (36.9%) cancer were most likely to report performance limitations, restricted ability to do routine activities (20.9% and 8.5%, respectively), and restricted ability to attend work or school (20.0% and 11.2%, respectively). Survivors of brain cancer were also most likely to report restricted abilities to perform personal care (10.5%). LIMITATIONS: There was the potential for participants to be healthier or more physically capable than nonparticipants or for persons to be more motivated to participate in this study if they had functional deficits. In addition, the nature of the questionnaire did not allow specific physical limitations to be measured. CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for functional limitations in physical performance and in participation in activities needed for daily living.","['Ness, Kirsten K', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Wall, Melanie M', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Gurney, James G']","['Ness KK', 'Mertens AC', 'Hudson MM', 'Wall MM', 'Leisenring WM', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Sklar CA', 'Robison LL', 'Gurney JG']","['Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. ness@epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,IM,"['Absenteeism', '*Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*physiopathology', 'Schools', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors', 'Work']",2005/11/03 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['143/9/639 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-143-9-200511010-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2005 Nov 1;143(9):639-47. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-143-9-200511010-00007.,,,,,,,,['CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['Ann Intern Med. 2005 Nov 1;143(9):I30.

We show here that c-Myb and c-Ets family members (Ets-1/2, PU.1, and Spi-B) control hGR 1A promoter regulation in T- and B-lymphoblast cells. Two T-lymphoblast lines, CEM-C7 and Jurkat, contain high levels of c-Myb and low levels of PU.1, whereas the opposite is true in IM-9 B-lymphoblasts. In Jurkat cells, overexpression of c-Ets-1, c-Ets-2, or PU.1 effectively represses dexamethasone-mediated up-regulation of an hGR 1A promoter-luciferase reporter gene, as do dominant negative c-Myb (c-Myb DNA-binding domain) or Ets proteins (Ets-2 DNA-binding domain). Overexpression of c-Myb in IM-9 cells confers hormone-dependent up-regulation to the hGR 1A promoter reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that hormone treatment causes the recruitment of hGR and c-Myb to the hGR 1A promoter in CEM-C7 cells, whereas hGR and PU.1 are recruited to this promoter in IM-9 cells. These observations suggest that the specific transcription factor that binds to footprint 12, when hGR binds to the adjacent footprint 11, determines the direction of hGR 1A promoter auto-regulation. This leads to a ""molecular switch"" model for auto-regulation of the hGR 1A promoter.","['Geng, Chuan-dong', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Geng CD', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Stanley S.

In the present study, we explored the apoptosis-inducing activity of HMA and the fundamental mechanism via which it regulates radiation-induced cell death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 was used. For X-irradiation and drug treatment, cells were plated at approximately 2x10(5) cells/ml. Exponentially growing cells were treated with 10 Gy of X-ray using a 6-MeV X-ray machine at a dose rate of 200-300 cGy/min. The cells were treated with 0.25 microM HMA immediately after irradiation and HMA remained for the entire culture period. The modes of cell death were discriminated by morphological changes, analysis of cell cycle, analysis of the mitochondrial events, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. RESULTS: Our data demonstrates that radiation induced a significant time-dependent increase of cell death and failed to sustain a prolonged G2 arrest in K562 cells. Radiation-induced cell death caused the accumulation of cyclinB1 and weak nuclear fragmentation, suggesting a mitotic catastrophe. This mitotic catastrophe was dependent upon the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening and was independent of caspase-3. In contrast, K562 cells treated with radiation and HMA had an accelerated cell death and induced a p53-independent apoptosis. This apoptotic pathway was dependent upon an initial hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, following the release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: Two mechanisms of radiation-induced cell death in K562 cells, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis, are regulated through distinct pathways, mitochondria and caspase-independent and -dependent, respectively. The findings of this study may provide new insights into improving the efficiency of radiotherapy in CML patients.","['Jo, Wol-Soon', 'Jeong, Min-Ho', 'Jin, Young-Hee', 'Jang, Ji-Yeon', 'Nam, Byung-Hyouk', 'Son, Seok-Hyun', 'Choi, Sun-Seob', 'Yoo, Young-Hyun', 'Kang, Chi-Dug', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin']","['Jo WS', 'Jeong MH', 'Jin YH', 'Jang JY', 'Nam BH', 'Son SH', 'Choi SS', 'Yoo YH', 'Kang CD', 'Lee JD', 'Jeong SJ']","['Research Supporting Center for Medical Science (BK21 Program), College of Medicine, Dong-A University, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*physiology', 'Mitosis/physiology/radiation effects', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",2005/11/03 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['P60181383661364Q [pii]', '10.1080/09553000500303773 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2005 Jul;81(7):531-43. doi: 10.1080/09553000500303773.,,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma VEGF levels were significantly higher in patients studied as compared with the 20 healthy subjects (p<0.001), the median plasma VEGF level detected in patients analysed and healthy controls was 433.4 pg mL(-1) (range 65.2-2,452.7 pg mL(-1)) and 81.6 pg mL(-1) (range 44.2-338.7 pg mL(-1)), respectively. On the other hand, no difference in bFGF plasma levels could be found between chronic-phase CML patients and the control group. There were significant associations between plasma VEGF levels and some characteristics of patients evaluated, with trends for higher VEGF values in patients with enlarged spleens (p = 0.02) and those with higher platelet count (p<0.001). Of the patients, 11 received imatinib treatment. The initial VEGF levels markedly decreased after 6 months of imatinib therapy in each patient (p<0.001).

Constitutively activated FLT3 provides cells with proliferative and anti-apoptotic advantages and portends an especially poor prognosis for patients with this mutation. FLT3/ITD mutations also contribute to a block of myeloid differentiation. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors suppress the growth and induce apoptosis and differentiation of leukemia cells expressing FLT3/ITD mutants. Therefore, FLT3 is a therapeutic target and inhibition of FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity may provide a new approach in the treatment of leukemia carrying these mutations.","['Zheng, Rui', 'Small, Donald']","['Zheng R', 'Small D']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*physiology']",2005/11/03 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['N108743T7771J436 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500261740 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2005 Dec;46(12):1679-87. doi: 10.1080/10428190500261740.,,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,89,,,,"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain KIR/KIR-L combinations might convey a predisposition to immune-mediated bone marrow failure. Examining the genotypic makeup of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (KIR-L) and KIR in patients with hematologic disorders could offer clues to immunogenetic risk factors for these diseases. The objective of this study is to establish the frequency of specific KIR genes and KIR-L alleles in aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplasia (MDS), and large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL), as compared with healthy control patients. METHODS: KIR genotyping was performed on DNA from 113 patients with AA, PNH, MDS, and LGL using sequence specific primer amplification. Results of genotypic KIR analysis were examined with HLA typing. Comparisons in frequency of KIR-L groups, KIR genotype profiles, and KIR/KIR-L mismatch were performed to determine whether specific KIR genes and KIR-L are overrepresented in bone marrow failure states. RESULTS: No difference in frequency of KIR-L groups was found relative to the healthy controls. AA and PNH showed decreased frequency of KIR-2DS1 and KIR-2DS5 genes: KIR-2DS1 35% vs 21% (p = 0.15) for AA and 19% for PNH (p = 0.13); KIR-2DS5 31% vs 14% (p = 0.08) for AA and 12% (p = 0.06) for PNH. These differences were even greater when compared to a larger group of control individuals from a study with similar genetic background. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced frequency of these KIR in AA and PNH may indicate an immunogenetic relationship between these diseases.","['Howe, Evan C', 'Wlodarski, Marcin', 'Ball, Edward J', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Howe EC', 'Wlodarski M', 'Ball EJ', 'Rybicki L', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Syndrome']",2005/11/03 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00362-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Nov;33(11):1357-62. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.07.005.,,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two compounds present a remarkable cytotoxicity after UVA irradiation (365 nm), reaching an IC50 of 0.1 microM in the leukaemia cell lines and 0.3-0.5 microM in the solid tumour cell lines. Their effect on the cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry in Jurkat cells. The compounds induce cell cycle perturbations and trigger a massive apoptosis as revealed by the externalisation of Annexin V-targeted residues at the outer plasmatic membrane. Furthermore the drugs induce, upon UVA irradiation significant variations of the mitochondrial potential (Deltapsi(mt)) measured by flow cytometry using the fluorochrome JC-1. In addition we characterized the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the probe dihydroethidine (HE) and the oxidations of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin using the interacting probe nonyl acridine orange (NAO). Both compounds stimulate the production of ROS, and remarkably induce oxidation of cardiolipin. We have investigated the DNA-binding properties of these two compounds by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence. The two compounds exhibit a low affinity toward the macromolecule. The mode of binding was also investigated by means of flow linear dichroism (LD) which has revealed that the two compounds do not efficiently intercalate into DNA. Finally, the DNA-photocleavaging properties of the test compounds were studied on pBR322 plasmid DNA as a model. Only compound 1 is able to induce a significant production of single strand breaks only after digestion with the base excision repair enzyme Endo III. Altogether these data suggest that DNA is not a preferential target of these molecules and other subcellular structures may be responsible for their high phototoxic activity.","['Viola, Giampietro', 'Salvador, Alessia', 'Vedaldi, Daniela', 'Fortunato, Elena', 'Disaro, Silvia', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Queiroz, Maria-Joao R P']","['Viola G', 'Salvador A', 'Vedaldi D', 'Fortunato E', 'Disaro S', 'Basso G', 'Queiroz MJ']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita di Padova, Via Marzolo 5, 35131 Padova, Italy. giampietro.viola.1@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Reducing clathrin levels by RNA interference did not significantly affect CALM localization, but depletion of AP2 weakens its association with the plasma membrane. In cells, where CALM levels were reduced by RNA interference, AP2 and clathrin remained organized in somewhat enlarged bright fluorescent puncta. Electron microscopy showed that the depletion of CALM drastically affected the clathrin lattice structure. Round-coated buds, which are the predominant features in control cells, were replaced by irregularly shaped buds and long clathrin-coated tubules. Moreover, we noted an increase in the number of very small cages that formed on flat lattices. Furthermore, we noticed a redistribution of endosomal markers and AP1 in cells that were CALM depleted. Taken together, our findings indicate a critical role for CALM in the regulation and orderly progression of coated bud formation at the plasma membrane.","['Meyerholz, Anika', 'Hinrichsen, Lars', 'Groos, Stephanie', 'Esk, Peter-Christopher', 'Brandes, Gudrun', 'Ungewickell, Ernst J']","['Meyerholz A', 'Hinrichsen L', 'Groos S', 'Esk PC', 'Brandes G', 'Ungewickell EJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, Center of Anatomy, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Str. 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Clathrin/*biosynthesis', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/deficiency/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factor AP-2/metabolism', 'trans-Golgi Network/metabolism']",2005/11/03 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/11/03 09:00'],"['2005/11/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRA355 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00355.x [doi]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2005 Dec;6(12):1225-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00355.x.,,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the abnormalities occurring in infants involve the MLL gene on chromosome band 11q23. We describe the molecular cytogenetic findings of 207 infant acute leukemia (IAL) cases included in the Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant acute leukemia. PROCEDURE: The diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was made according to morphology and immunophenotyping classification, followed by conventional karyotyping. Samples were then screened using RT-PCR for the presence of specific chromosome translocations. FISH assay for MLL rearrangements was performed only in cases with negative or inconclusive cytogenetic or PCR results. RESULTS: The characteristics of children with IAL were as follows: 115 boys and 92 girls, age range 0-23 months, mean age 12 months, 145 ALL, and 62 AML. A statistically significant association was observed between pro-B ALL cases and MLL+ve (P=0.0001) cases and the age group 0-3 months with MLL+ve (P=0.008) cases. Two rare cases of pro-T ALL with MLL+ve were found. Other than MLL rearrangements, various other molecular aberrations were detected including TEL/AML1+ve (n=9), E2A/PBX1+ve (n=4), PML/RARA+ve (n=4), and AML1/ETO+ve (n=2). Cytogenetic analysis revealed hyperdiploidy (n=6), del(7) in two cases and del(11)(q23) in seven cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that not only MLL rearrangements, but also other molecular abnormalities occur before birth and may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Agudelo Arias, Diana Patricia', 'Coser, Virginia Maria', 'de Brito, Gilena Dantas', 'Macedo Silva, Maria L', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Emerenciano M', 'Agudelo Arias DP', 'Coser VM', 'de Brito GD', 'Macedo Silva ML', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Coordenacao de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Brazil', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/11/02 09:00,2006/12/14 09:00,['2005/11/02 09:00'],"['2005/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20654 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Oct 15;47(5):549-54. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20654.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant Acute Leukemia'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial progress was made by three major events: (1) active chemotherapeutic agents were identified which led to remissions for the first time in this disease; (2) cooperative groups were instituted leading to important clinical trials; and (3) several single institutions began experimenting with the role of allogeneic matched sibling donor (MSD) BMT as effective intensification. Over the last 25 years, the cure rate has improved from <20% to 50% or higher. Most of the clinical research during this time of great advancement focused on two major themes: (1) the role of aggressive induction therapy in not only improving CR rates but in post-remission outcomes; and (2) the role of aggressive post-remission therapy in further improving survival, with an emphasis on high-dose Ara C-based chemotherapy, BMT, and supportive care. But we have ""miles to go before we sleep."" Some of the challenges that will lead to ongoing reduction of population-based mortality for AML through young adulthood include: (1) improving access of adolescents to pediatric AML therapy; (2) stratification by prognostic factors; (3) individualized therapy based on individual genetics and leukemia cell biology; (4) and the use of novel therapies including targeted immuno-conjugates and ""small molecules"" which disrupt abnormal signal transduction pathways.

We previously reported that NIH3T3 cells overexpressing Cdt1 readily formed tumors in mice. To further investigate its oncogenic mechanism, we generated transgenic mice expressing Cdt1 in thymocytes. Our studies demonstrated that T-cell-directed Cdt1 transgenic mice showed normal T-cell development. However, such transgenic mice developed thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma when crossed with p53 null mice. Furthermore, tumor cells derived from NIH3T3 cells overexpressing Cdt1 displayed numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations in the form of ploidy, double minutes, translocation, inversion, chromosome end-to-end fusion and robertsonian mutation.

Analysis of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes can facilitate the identification of the normal B-cell counterpart of lymphomas and leukemias, as Ig genes acquire somatic hypermutation in germinal centers during the immune response to antigen. Therefore, lymphomas that derive from a naive, pregerminal center B cell lack somatic hypermutation in the clonal Ig gene, whereas germinal center-derived lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, display somatic hypermutation of their Ig genes. Furthermore, biases in the Ig variable heavy chain gene repertoire in B-cell malignancies can indicate a possible antigenic influence in pathogenesis. Much work has been accomplished in the past decade to characterize the Ig genes in different lymphoma entities, and the separation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia into two prognostic subgroups in the late 1990s based on the presence or absence of somatic hypermutation led to investigations of Ig genes in larger cohorts of previously uncharacterized entities, such as mantle cell lymphoma. This review will briefly discuss relevant aspects of normal B-cell development, and then focus on what can be ascertained from Ig studies of newly characterized entities, mantle cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma, from the point of view of cellular origin and variable heavy chain gene restrictions as a sign of antigen involvement. Correlations with gene expression profiling data and the clinical implications of Ig gene studies, when relevant, will be mentioned.

The detailed understanding of mechanisms of protein-drug interaction and drug resistance through biophysical methods demands a method for the production of active protein on the milligram scale. We have developed a bacterial expression system for the kinase domains of c-Abl and c-Src, which allows for the quick expression and purification of active wild-type and mutant kinase domains by coexpression with the YopH tyrosine phosphatase.

As a quintessential chromosomal translocation gene product, LMO2 has many properties that typify this class of molecule. In addition to its involvement in chromosomal translocations, the LMO2 gene was inadvertently activated in an X-SCID gene therapy trial by retroviral insertion. New molecular therapies targeted directly at the LMO2 protein could have major impact as adjuncts to existing therapies or as therapeutics in their own right. In this review, we outline the current knowledge about LMO2 and some possible routes to develop reagents that might be possible macromolecular drugs in the future.","['Nam, Chang-Hoon', 'Rabbitts, Terence H']","['Nam CH', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/physiology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiprotein Complexes/physiology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/*physiology']",2005/11/02 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2005/11/02 09:00'],"['2005/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(05)01607-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2006 Jan;13(1):15-25. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.09.010.

In the case of gammaretrovirus vectors based on murine leukemia virus, many integration events are completely silenced in undifferentiated stem cells and in transgenic mice. Gammaretrovirus vectors are also subject to variegation in which sister cells bearing the same provirus differentially express, and cell differentiation can lead to extinction of vector expression. In contrast, lentivirus vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 appear to express more efficiently, although other reports indicate that lentivirus vectors can be silenced. This review summarizes the key features of gammaretrovirus vector silencing. The evidence for and against gene silencing of lentivirus vectors is described with special emphasis on the potential effects of vector design, provirus copy number, and integration site preferences on silencing. This analysis suggests that the difference between selfinactivating (SIN) lentivirus vectors and their modified SIN gammaretrovirus counterparts may be less dramatic than previously thought. It will therefore be important to further characterize the mechanisms of silencing, in order to create better gammaretrovirus and lentivirus vectors that consistently express at single copy for gene therapy.","['Ellis, James']",['Ellis J'],"['Developmental Biology Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1L7. jellis@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Animals', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Stem Cells/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Integration']",2005/11/02 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/11/02 09:00'],"['2005/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2005.16.1241 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2005 Nov;16(11):1241-6. doi: 10.1089/hum.2005.16.1241.,,,,68,,,,['5-U54-HL070588/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, VK3 was found to simultaneously induce cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, including superoxide anion (O2*-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, and histone hyperacetylation in human leukemia HL-60 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Catalase (CAT), an antioxidant enzyme that specifically scavenges H2O2, could significantly diminish both histone acetylation increase and cell death caused by VK3, whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that specifically eliminates O2*-, showed no effect on both of these, leading to the conclusion that H2O2 generation, but not O2*- generation, contributes to VK3-induced histone hyperacetylation and cell death. This conclusion was confirmed by the finding that enhancement of VK3-induced H2O2 generation by vitamin C (VC) could significantly promote both the histone hyperacetylation and cell death. Further studies suggested that histone hyperacetylation played an important role in VK3-induced cell death, since sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, showed no effect on ROS generation, but obviously potentiated VK3-induced histone hyperacetylation and cell death. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism for the anticancer activity of VK3, i.e., VK3 induced tumor cell death through H2O2 generation, which then further induced histone hyperacetylation.","['Lin, Changjun', 'Kang, Jiuhong', 'Zheng, Rongliang']","['Lin C', 'Kang J', 'Zheng R']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Vitamin K 3/*pharmacology']",2005/11/02 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/02 09:00'],"['2005/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2005 Oct;60(10):765-71.,,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the hierarchy of promoter methylations and genomic alterations as well as the interaction with other cell-cycle regulator CDKN1A is poorly understood. A complete methylation-specific PCR coupled with direct sequencing of 71 MCL patient samples previously characterized for TP53 alterations, Ki67 expression by immunohistochemistry, and other genomic alterations was performed. In contrast to rare p16(INK4a) promoter methylation (9%), frequent p15(INK4b) (62%) and p14(ARF) (70%) promoter methylation was detectable in MCL. In an additional 16% of MCL cases, LOH for p16(INK4a) was detected. However, MCL cases with p15(INK4b) methylation tended to have lower proliferation (73% vs. 57%), and p15(INK4b) and p14(ARF) promoter methylation was also detected in normal stem cells. Therefore, epigenetic changes of those genes seem not to represent primary oncogenic mechanisms but physiological mechanisms of cell regulation.

The median leukemic blasts was 25% and age 28 years (range, 3-56). Twenty-one patients had untreated relapse, 13 failed reinduction, eight in partial remission and two aplastic. Conditioning was myeloablative using cyclophosphamide, busulfan, total-body irradiation and etoposide (Bu/Cy/VP, n=22; TBI/Cy/VP, n=17; others, n=5) followed by marrow or peripheral blood transplant (n=23/21) from unrelated or related donors (n=28/16). All patients had graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporin and methotrexate. One patient experienced late graft failure. Severe acute-GVHD and chronic-GVHD appeared in eight and 14 patients, respectively. Thirteen patients (30%) remain alive after a median of 25.3 months (range, 2.4-134.1); with 31 deaths, mostly from relapse (n=15) and infections (n=12). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years was 28 and 26%, respectively. OS and PFS were significantly better with blasts < or =20% and time to transplant < or =1 year while transplant-related mortality was less with the use of TBI.

Therefore, we determined the kinetics of DC and T-cell chimerism establishment after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) in a group of 144 patients, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic cell sorting (MACS) followed by FISH or STR-PCR analysis for chimerism evaluation. In all, three cell lines investigated (CD3(+) T cells, CD11c(+) DC1 and CD123(+) DC2), we found a rapid and consistent establishment of complete donor chimerism (CDC) in over 70% of all patients during the first 6 weeks after AHCT. The rate of patients with CDC increased significantly over time within the first year after transplantation. A related donor (P=0.004) as well as an underlying lymphatic leukemia (P=0.03) were found to be significantly associated with development of MC in T cells. No significant correlation between DC or T cell chimerism and GvHD or relapse was detected. Our results thus demonstrate a fast and stable CDC in DC1, DC2 and T cells after AHCT that continuously increases over time in nearly all patients.","['Boeck, S', 'Hamann, M', 'Pihusch, V', 'Heller, T', 'Diem, H', 'Rolf, B', 'Pihusch, R', 'Kolb, H-J', 'Pihusch, M']","['Boeck S', 'Hamann M', 'Pihusch V', 'Heller T', 'Diem H', 'Rolf B', 'Pihusch R', 'Kolb HJ', 'Pihusch M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany. stefan.boeck@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/immunology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera/blood/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/11/01 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705217 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705217 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;37(1):57-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases assessed by conventional cytogenetics had a complex karyotype. There were 10 men and four women, with a median age of 55 years (range, 29-72). None of these patients had a history of follicular lymphoma. The biopsy specimens were obtained from bone marrow, lymph node, and extranodal sites. Morphologically, nine neoplasms had features of Burkitt or atypical Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and three were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with high-grade cytologic features. The remaining two cases were plasmablastic myeloma and low-grade B-cell lymphoma, respectively. All cases expressed BCL-2. The proliferation index assessed by using Ki-67 (MIB1) was 5% in the low-grade B-cell lymphoma, 80% in the plasmablastic myeloma, 90-95% in three cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and ranged from 90 to >99% in most Burkitt and atypical Burkitt neoplasms. The patient with low-grade B-cell lymphoma was treated with rituximab. All other patients received intensive combination chemotherapy. Two of these patients underwent bone marrow transplantation, and one patient received radiation therapy in addition to transplantation. The median follow-up period was 9 months (range, 3-81). In all, 10 patients died with a median survival of 9 months (range, 3-81). We conclude that most B-cell lymphomas with concurrent t(14;18) and 8q24/c-MYC translocations fall within the morphologic spectrum of diffuse large B-cell and Burkitt lymphoma. These neoplasms are high-grade and are associated with a poor prognosis. However, this combination of molecular abnormalities can also rarely occur in other neoplasms, such as the cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoma and plasmablastic myeloma in this study.","['Kanungo, Anuradha', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Lin, Pei']","['Kanungo A', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Lin P']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/11/01 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['3800500 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.3800500 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2006 Jan;19(1):25-33. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800500.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While nonmyeloablative HCT has been associated with reduced regimen-related toxicities and has been curative for a number of patients with hematologic malignancies, challenges have remained in regard to graft-versus-host disease, infections, and disease progression.

HU inhibits DNA replication and induces apoptosis in a cell type-dependent manner, yet the relevant pathways that mediate apoptosis in response to this agent are not well characterized. In this study, we employed the human myeloid leukemia 1 (ML-1) cell line as a model to investigate the mechanisms of HU-induced apoptosis. Exposure of ML-1 cells to HU caused rapid cell death that was accompanied by hallmark features of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, phosphatidylserine translocation, and caspase activation. HU-induced apoptosis required new protein synthesis, was induced by HU exposures as short as 15 min, and correlated with the accumulation of p53 and induction of the p53 target gene PUMA. p53 induction in ML-1 cells was ATR dependent and downregulation of p53 through RNAi delayed HU-induced apoptosis. HU did not induce p53 or induce apoptosis in Molt-3 leukemia cells, even though exposure to HU induced a comparable level of DNA damage and robustly activated the ATR pathway. The microtubule inhibitor nocodazole suppressed HU-induced p53 accumulation in ML-1 cells suggesting that a microtubule-dependent event contributes to p53 induction and apoptosis in this cell line. Our findings outline an HU-induced cell death pathway and suggest that activation of ATR is necessary, but not sufficient, for stabilization of p53 in response to DNA replication stress.","['Kumar, Sujatha', 'Dodson, Gerald E', 'Trinh, Anthony', 'Puchalski, Joel R', 'Tibbetts, Randal S']","['Kumar S', 'Dodson GE', 'Trinh A', 'Puchalski JR', 'Tibbetts RS']","['Department of Pharmacology, Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Program, The University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis']",2005/11/01 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2169 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.11.2169 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Nov;4(11):1667-74. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.11.2169.

A major clinical challenge is the fact that most anticancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic range, that is, their effective dose is relatively close to that associated with substantial toxicity. Significant advances have been achieved in event-free survival of patients with many types of cancer (most dramatically childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL) through a better understanding of the pathobiology of human cancers, the cellular mechanisms of cancer chemotherapy, and the determinants of inter-individual differences in drug effects and treatment response. It is anticipated that expanding our knowledge of these areas will lead to the development of new anticancer agents and to more effective use of existing cancer chemotherapy. Pharmacogenomics research aims to elucidate the genetics determinants of drug efficacy and toxicity. Results of recent studies indicate that both qualitative and quantitative genomic analyses may be required for precise pharmacogenomic characterization of some types of human cancer.","['Cheng, Qing', 'Evans, William E']","['Cheng Q', 'Evans WE']","[""Hematological Malignancies Program, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennesee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemical synthesis/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Pharmacogenetics/*methods']",2005/11/01 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2160 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.11.2160 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Nov;4(11):1506-9. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.11.2160.

It has also been recently shown to alter metabolism of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This has led us to examine the effect of PFTalpha on the activity of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1 isoforms, known to metabolize PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene (BP), into mutagenic metabolites. We report that PFTalpha caused a potent inhibition of CYP1-related activity as measured by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity in CYP1-containing MCF-7 cells and liver microsomes. It also directly affected the catalytic activity of human recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 isoforms, with a potent inhibitory effect towards CYP1B1. The nature of this CYP1B1 inhibition by PFTalpha was mixed-type with an apparent K(i) of 4.38 nM. Blockage of CYP1 activity by PFTalpha was associated with a decreased metabolism of BP, a reduced formation of BP-derived adducts and a diminished BP-induced apoptosis in human cultured cells targets for PAHs like primary human macrophages and p53-negative KG1a leukaemia cells. These data further substantiate an unexpected and p53-independent action of PFTalpha for preventing toxicity of chemical carcinogens such as PAHs, through inhibition of CYP1 enzyme activities, especially that of CYP1B1.","['Sparfel, Lydie', 'Van Grevenynghe, Julien', 'Le Vee, Marc', 'Aninat, Caroline', 'Fardel, Olivier']","['Sparfel L', 'Van Grevenynghe J', 'Le Vee M', 'Aninat C', 'Fardel O']","['INSERM U620, IFR 140, Universite de Rennes I, 2 Avenue du Pr Leon Bernard, 35043 Rennes, France. lydie.sparfel@rennes.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Benzo(a)pyrene/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Macrophages', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Toluene/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*drug effects']",2005/11/01 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgi256 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgi256 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2006 Mar;27(3):656-63. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgi256.

Ig status detection is commonly performed with a panel of V(H) family-specific primers. Although this method detects clonal VDJ rearrangement in virtually all cases, it is technically cumbersome and therefore not widely used clinically. Here, we describe a simple and rapid method to establish the mutational status of IgV(H) in CLL. The method is based on a consensus V(H) FR2 primer, used in both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing reactions. Overall, monoclonal B-cell populations were detected in 163 of 189 CLL patients (86%). The prognostic value of IgV(H) mutational status was then evaluated by analyzing survival in 146 CLL cases using different V(H) homology cutoffs. CLL prognostic groups were best separated by the classical 98% cutoff: median survival was 127 and 206 months in unmutated and mutated CLL cases, respectively (P = 0.0023). V(H) FR2 consensus and V(H) family PCR were compared in 41 cases, correctly assigning all cases by both methods. Therefore, we suggest a sequential strategy to detect immunoglobulin mutational status in CLL patients by first using the approach described in this study followed by alternative V(H) family-specific PCRs for negative cases.","['Marasca, Roberto', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Morselli, Monica', 'Zucchini, Patrizia', 'Castelli, Ilaria', 'Martinelli, Silvia', 'Fontana, Marcella', 'Ravanetti, Sara', 'Curotti, Monica', 'Leonardi, Giovanna', 'Cagossi, Katia', 'Partesotti, Giovanni', 'Torelli, Giuseppe']","['Marasca R', 'Maffei R', 'Morselli M', 'Zucchini P', 'Castelli I', 'Martinelli S', 'Fontana M', 'Ravanetti S', 'Curotti M', 'Leonardi G', 'Cagossi K', 'Partesotti G', 'Torelli G']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Del Pozzo 71, 41100 Modena, Italy. marasca@unimore.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/11/01 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60589-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60589-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2005 Nov;7(5):566-74. doi: 10.1016/S1525-1578(10)60589-2.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",PMC1867549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of VEGF suppress the growth of pancreatic cancer in preclinical models. The objectives of this phase II study were to assess the response rate and overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients who received gemcitabine with the recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously untreated advanced pancreatic cancer received gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Bevacizumab, 10 mg/kg, was administered after gemcitabine on days 1 and 15. Tumor measurements were assessed every two cycles. Plasma VEGF levels were obtained pretreatment. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled at seven centers between November 2001 and March 2004. All patients had metastatic disease, and 83% had liver metastases. Eleven patients (21%) had confirmed partial responses, and 24 (46%) had stable disease. The 6-month survival rate was 77%. Median survival was 8.8 months; median progression-free survival was 5.4 months. Pretreatment plasma VEGF levels did not correlate with outcome. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included hypertension in 19% of the patients, thrombosis in 13%, visceral perforation in 8%, and bleeding in 2%. CONCLUSION: The combination of bevacizumab plus gemcitabine is active in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Additional study is warranted.

METHODS: This study involved analysis of longitudinal data from the University HealthSystem Consortium database from 1995 to 2002. All patients who were 21 years or younger, with diagnostic codes for both neoplastic disease and febrile neutropenia at discharge, were included. RESULTS: A total of 12,446 patients were identified for the study. The los was 5 days or less for 6,799 patients, and greater than 5 days for 5,647 patients. The mortality rate was 3%. On bivariate analysis, race, age, cancer type, and associated complications (bacteremia/sepsis, hypotension, pneumonia, and fungal infections) were significantly associated with longer length of stay and death. On multivariate analysis, age group, race, cancer type (acute myeloid leukemia, multiple cancers v acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and the complication variables were significantly associated with increased risk of longer los and death. Certain types of cancer (Hodgkin's disease, osteosarcoma/Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, compared with acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and year of discharge after 1995 were significantly associated with a reduced risk of longer length of stay and/or mortality. CONCLUSION: Race, age group, year of discharge, associated complications, and cancer type were significantly associated with risk of longer los and mortality. These factors may potentially help in identifying high-risk patients who might benefit from targeted antibiotic therapy or prophylactic hematopoietic growth factor support.","['Basu, Swati K', 'Fernandez, Isabel D', 'Fisher, Susan G', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Lyman, Gary H']","['Basu SK', 'Fernandez ID', 'Fisher SG', 'Asselin BL', 'Lyman GH']","['University of Rochester Medical Center, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2005/11/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/31/7958 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.01.6378 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Nov 1;23(31):7958-66. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.6378.,,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1987 and 1990, the multicenter trial Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Relapse Study of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group (ALL-REZ BFM) 87 was conducted to establish a uniform treatment for these children in Germany and Austria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 207 registered patients, 183 patients were stratified into three groups according to the protocol: A, early bone marrow (BM) relapse (n = 56); B, late BM relapse (n = 101); C, isolated extramedullary relapse (n = 26). Treatment consisted of risk-adapted alternating short-course multiagent systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, cranial irradiation, if indicated, and conventional maintenance therapy. Additionally, 24 patients with an exceptionally poor prognosis (early BM or any relapse of T-cell ALL) were treated with individual regimens. In 35 patients, stem-cell transplantation was performed. RESULTS: The probability of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of all registered patients at 15 years was 0.30 +/- 0.03 and 0.37 +/- 0.03, respectively, with significant differences between the strategic groups (A, 0.18 +/- 0.05 and 0.20 +/- 0.05; B, 0.44 +/- 0.05 and 0.52 +/- 0.05; C, 0.35 +/- 0.09 and 0.42 +/- 0.10). Despite risk-adapted treatment, an early time point of relapse and T-lineage immunophenotype were significant predictors of inferior EFS in uni- and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: With the ALL-REZ BFM 87 protocol, more than one-third of patients may be regarded as cured from recurrent ALL with second complete remissions lasting more than 10 years. Immunophenotype and time point of relapse are important prognostic factors that allow us to adapt more precisely treatment intensity to individual prognosis in future trials.","['Einsiedel, Hagen Graf', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Hartmann, Reinhard', 'Fengler, Rudiger', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta', 'Mann, Georg', 'Hahlen, Karel', 'Gobel, Ulrich', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Henze, Gunter']","['Einsiedel HG', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Hartmann R', 'Fengler R', 'Schrappe M', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Mann G', 'Hahlen K', 'Gobel U', 'Klingebiel T', 'Ludwig WD', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/11/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/31/7942 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.01.1031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Nov 1;23(31):7942-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.1031.,,"['FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 1;26(13):2238'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to use the information to further refine therapy and advance cure rates. METHODS: Cumulative incidence functions of any post-treatment failure or any post-treatment relapse were estimated by the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice and compared with Gray's test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Of the 827 patients who completed all treatment while in initial complete remission, 134 patients subsequently had major adverse events, including 90 leukemic relapses, 40 second malignancies, and four deaths in remission. The cumulative incidence of any adverse event was 14.0% +/- 1.2% (SE) at 5 years and 16.9% +/- 1.4% at 10 years. The risk of any leukemic relapse was 10.0% +/- 1.1% at 5 years and 11.4% +/- 1.2% at 10 years. Male sex was the only independent predictor of relapse (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.74; P = .02).

In vivo studies have implicated SOCS3 as a negative regulator of signaling downstream of gp130, the receptor subunit shared by IL-6-like cytokines. Mice lacking SOCS3 die at midgestation because of placental failure, and SOCS3 ablation in a cell-type-specific manner results in changes in the functional outcome of gp130 signaling in response to IL-6. In this study, we show that genetic reduction of leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) production by embryo-derived tissues is sufficient to prevent the placental defect. This establishes LIF signaling as a major physiological regulator of trophoblast differentiation in vivo. Mice deficient in both SOCS3 and LIF are born in predicted numbers and appear normal at birth but exhibit failure to thrive and high neonatal mortality. Adult SOCS3-null mice on a LIF-null background succumb to a spontaneous fatal inflammatory disease characterized by neutrophilia and inflammatory-cell tissue infiltrates. The disease spectrum mimics that seen in mice with a conditional deletion of SOCS3 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells, extending the evidence for a major role for SOCS3 in the homeostatic regulation of the inflammatory response and indicates that LIF is not required for this process.","['Robb, Lorraine', 'Boyle, Kristy', 'Rakar, Steven', 'Hartley, Lynne', 'Lochland, Janelle', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Metcalf, Donald']","['Robb L', 'Boyle K', 'Rakar S', 'Hartley L', 'Lochland J', 'Roberts AW', 'Alexander WS', 'Metcalf D']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia. robb@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Inflammation/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Placentation/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2005/11/01 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['0508023102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0508023102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Nov 8;102(45):16333-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0508023102.

Fifteen cases of HAL were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), focusing on organelles and myeloperoxidase (MPO) reaction of leukemic cells. By TEM, 5 out 15 cases of HAL were consistent with immunophenotyping (3 cases of biphenotypic type, and 2 cases of biclonal type with granulocytes and lymphocytes); 2 cases were suspected as HAL. On other hand, 5 cases of HAL were assigned to ALL, and 2 cases were misinterpreted as M5a and 1 as M4b. Most of the blast cells of biphenotypic HAL showed lymphoid features, except some cases containing MPO positive granules in blasts, while a few cases exhibited monocytic or nonspecific features. TEM offers advantages in the diagnosis of biclonal type HAL and biphenotypic HAL positive for MPO. However, it is difficult to differentiate MPO-negative cases of biphenotypic HAL from ALL and a few cases may be misinterpreted as M5 by TEM.","['Ru, Yong-Xin', 'Wang, Hui-Jun', 'Yang, Bing-Xin', 'Liu, Jin-Hua', 'Li, Zhan-Qi', 'Li, Cheng-Wen', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang', 'Mi, Ying-Chang']","['Ru YX', 'Wang HJ', 'Yang BX', 'Liu JH', 'Li ZQ', 'Li CW', 'Wang JX', 'Mi YC']","['Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology']",2005/11/01 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['JH0551V0X1585361 [pii]', '10.1080/019131290968722 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 2005 Sep-Oct;29(5):341-7. doi: 10.1080/019131290968722.,,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, replicating viruses have emerged as attractive tools for cancer therapy, but generally achieve only transitory tumor regression. In contrast to other replicating virus systems, transduction by replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) vectors is efficient, tumor-selective, and persistent. Correlating with its efficient replicative spread, RCR vector expressing the yeast cytosine deaminase suicide gene exhibited remarkably enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro after administration of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine. In vivo, RCR vectors replicated throughout preestablished primary gliomas without spread to adjacent normal brain, resulting in profound tumor inhibition after a single injection of virus and single cycle of prodrug administration. Furthermore, stable integration of the replicating vector resulted in persistent infection that achieved complete transduction of ectopic glioma foci that had migrated away from the primary tumor site. Thus, efficient and stable integration of suicide genes represents a unique property of the RCR vector that achieved multiple cycles of synchronous cell killing upon repeated prodrug administration, resulting in chronic suppression of tumor growth and prolonged survival.","['Tai, Chien-Kuo', 'Wang, Wei Jun', 'Chen, Thomas C', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Tai CK', 'Wang WJ', 'Chen TC', 'Kasahara N']","['Department of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flucytosine/therapeutic use', '*Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma/genetics/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2005/11/01 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(05)00139-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2005 Nov;12(5):842-51. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.03.017.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)']",PMC8185609,,,,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS1710116'],,,,,,,,,,

Both freshly harvested Jurkat and NIT-1 cells induced to undergo apoptosis displayed poor retention of the potential-sensitive, intrinsically fluorescent dye, TMRE. Treatment with formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde completely abolished TMRE uptake in both cell types regardless of apoptosis induction. Interestingly, freshly harvested apoptotic Jurkat cells exhibited lower retention of H2-CMX-Ros, indicating marked reduction in the oxidative status of lymphoid cells during apoptosis. This is in contrast to NIT-1 cells which failed to display significant reduction in H2-CMX-Ros retention after anoikis induction. Paraformaldehyde treatment reduced the retention of H2-CMX-Ros in live Jurkat cells but still allowed the discrimination of apoptotic cells which poorly retained H2-CMX-Ros. However, live Jurkat cells lost their ability to retain H2-CMX-Ros after formaldehyde treatment. In contrast, treatment with paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde did not have significant impact on the retention of H2-CMX-Ros in both live and apoptotic NIT-1 cells. The uptake of MTR580 was independent of mitochondrial membrane potential in both T and beta cell lines. However, MTR580 was comparable to H2-CMX-Ros for confocal microscopic analysis of apoptotic Jurkat cells following fixation with formaldehyde and cell permeabilization. These data demonstrate that while TMRE and H2-CMX-Ros are suitable for determining mitochondrial membrane potential changes during apoptosis in lymphoid cells, only TMRE is suitable for such analysis in beta cells.

METHODS: In this study, p210 bcr/abl positive leukemia cell specimens were obtained from 25 CML cases, meanwhile, bone marrow and peripheral blood cell samples from 8 non-tumor individuals and 10 normal individuals were used as p210 bcr/abl negative controls. K562 and KU812 leukemia cells were used as p210 bcr/abl positive controls, and KG-1 leukemia cell line was used as Shp-2 positive control. Specimens of peripheral blood and bone marrow of 25 adult patients of chronic myelocytic leukemia, 15 males and 10 females, aged 28-64, were collected. Specimens of bone marrow of 8 basically healthy adult volunteers and specimens of peripheral blood of 10 healthy adult volunteers were used as controls. The total cell protein was collected and the expression of Shp-2 was examined by Western blotting. Human leukemia cells of the line K562 were cultured. Shp-2 specific sense and antisense oligonucleotides were added into the culture fluid respectively. The cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). STI571, specific inhibitor of p210 bcr/abl was added into the cultured fluid of K562 cells, then Western blotting and FCM were used to detect the protein expression of Shp-2 and p210 bcr/abl, and cell apoptosis. RESULTS: Phosphorylated Shp-2 (pShp)-2 protein was overexpressed in 92% (23/25) of the CML cells, but lowly expressed or not expressed in the normal hematopoietic cells. The mean pShp-2 protein/beta-actin ratio of the primary CML leukemia cells was 0.91 +/- 0.62, significantly higher than those of the normal bone marrow cells and peripheral blood hematopoietic cells (0.16 +/- 0.09 and 0.03 +/- 0.05 respectively, both P < 0.01). The apoptotic rates of the CML cells treated by Shp-2 specific antisense oligonucleotide of the concentrations of 1 micromol/L and 4 micromol/L respectively for 72 h was 7.98% and 20.29% respectively, both significantly higher than that of the control group (4.06%, P < 0.01).

Twenty-four and 48 hours after the stimulation of STI571 the expression level of Shp-2 protein in the CML cells decreased time-dependently and the CML cell apoptotic rates were 31.15% and 38.69% respectively, both lower than that of the control group (33.6%).

From day 10 and to day 14, the blood arsenic concentration and urinary arsenic excretion reached a steady state. The average minimal concentration (Cmin) and maximal concentration (Cmax) of blood arsenic was (53.3 +/- 9.0) microg/L and (70.7 +/- 10.8) microg/L. t 1/2 was prolonged to (70.7 +/- 31.7) hour, and area under curve (AUC) was (448.9 +/- 71.8) microg. h(-1).L(-1). Median time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 1 (range 0.5 - 8) hour. During As(4)S(4) therapy, 24-hour arsenic content in urine was (6170.8 +/- 3141.8) microg/L and it accounted for about (0.152 +/- 0.082)% of the total daily dosage. It decreased steadily over time after drug withdrawal, arsenic accumulated in hair and the concentration could be ten-fold higher than that before treatment. CONCLUSION: Multi-dose oral As(4)S(4) is safe and has been relatively well tolerated in APL patients in spite of the tendency of its retention in some tissues after long time administration.","['Wang, Feng-rong', 'Lou, Ya-qing', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Wang FR', 'Lou YQ', 'Lu DP']","[""The People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arsenic/metabolism', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Hair/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Sulfides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics']",2005/11/01 09:00,2006/07/22 09:00,['2005/11/01 09:00'],"['2005/11/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;44(10):730-3.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Sulfides)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fresh leaves of Catha edulis are customarily chewed to attain a state of stimulation. The fact that cathinone has a closer structural similarity with amphetamine, and both share common pharmacodynamic features, led to the conclusion that cathinone is the most important active ingredient of Catha edulis, which causes the major pharmacological effects. Problems associated with repeated consumption of Catha edulis leaves are becoming evident. Literature surveys and clinical diagnostic studies revealed an association with prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. Repeated intermittent oral administration of Catha edulis to laboratory animals lead to development and expression of locomotor sensitisation. Catha edulis also leads to several peripheral effects that include increases in blood pressure and has been associated with the increased incidence of acute coronary vasospasm and myocardial infarction. Catha edulis also accounts for a number of gastrointestinal tract problems, oesophagitis, gastritis and delay intestinal absorption, as well as the development of oral keratotic white lesions at the site of chewing. Administration of Catha edulis extracts showed a deranged systemic capacity to handle oxidative radicals and induces cytotoxic effects in cells of liver and kidney, as well as induction of cell death in various human leukaemia cell lines and in peripheral human blood leukocytes.","['Al-Habori, Molham']",['Al-Habori M'],"[""Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Sana'a, P.O.

Significance of selective renal shielding blocks.,704-8,"PURPOSE: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the outcome of total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on leukemia patients. Also studied was the risk of renal dysfunction after TBI/BMT with or without the use of selective renal shielding blocks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cases of 109 leukemia patients who received TBI as a component of the conditioning regimen for their BMT were reviewed. They received 12 Gy of TBI in six fractions over 3 consecutive days. Doses to eyes and lungs were reduced to 7 Gy and 8 Gy, respectively, by customized organ shielding blocks. After March 1999, renal shielding blocks were used to constrain the renal dose to 10 Gy. The patients were followed for a median period of 16.6 months (range: 0.3-180.1 months). RESULTS: The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 55.4% and 43.2%, respectively. Renal dysfunction-free rates were different between those with and without renal shielding blocks: 100% and 78.5%, respectively, at 2 years. Overall survivals were not significantly different among these patients: 60.4% and 52.9%, respectively, at 2 years in patients with and without renal shielding blocks (p = 0.53). CONCLUSION: The use of selective renal shielding blocks provided evidence for reducing radiation-induced renal toxicities without decreasing the overall survival rate.","['Igaki, Hiroshi', 'Karasawa, Katsuyuki', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Saito, Hiroshi', 'Nakagawa, Keiichi', 'Ohtomo, Kuni', 'Tanaka, Yoshiaki']","['Igaki H', 'Karasawa K', 'Sakamaki H', 'Saito H', 'Nakagawa K', 'Ohtomo K', 'Tanaka Y']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. igaki-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Although HTLV-2 is highly homologous to HTLV-1, infection with HTLV-2 has not been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Lentivirus-mediated transduction of CD34(+) cells with HTLV-1 Tax (Tax1) induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and resulted in the concomitant suppression of multilineage hematopoiesis in vitro. Tax1 induced transcriptional upregulation of the cdk inhibitors p21(cip1/waf1) (p21) and p27(kip1) (p27), and marked suppression of hematopoiesis in immature (CD34(+)/CD38(-)) hematopoietic progenitor cells in comparison to CD34(+)/CD38(+) cells. HTLV-1 infection of CD34(+) cells also induced p21 and p27 expression. Tax1 also protected CD34(+) cells from serum withdrawal-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, HTLV-2 Tax (Tax2) did not detectably alter p21 or p27 gene expression, failed to induce cell cycle arrest, failed to suppress hematopoiesis in CD34(+) cells, and did not protect cells from programmed cell death. A Tax2/Tax1 chimera encoding the C-terminal 53 amino acids of Tax1 fused to Tax2 (Tax(221)) displayed a phenotype in CD34(+) cells similar to that of Tax1, suggesting that unique domains encoded within the C terminus of Tax1 may account for the phenotypes displayed in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. These remarkable differences in the activities of Tax1 and Tax2 in CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells may underlie the sharp differences observed in the pathogenesis resulting from infection with HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.","['Tripp, Adam', 'Banerjee, Prabal', 'Sieburg, Michelle', 'Planelles, Vicente', 'Li, Fengzhi', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Tripp A', 'Banerjee P', 'Sieburg M', 'Planelles V', 'Li F', 'Feuer G']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 750 East Adams St., Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/virology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'Transfection', 'Virus Latency']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/22/14069 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.22.14069-14078.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Nov;79(22):14069-78. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.22.14069-14078.2005.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",PMC1280183,,,,,['R29 CA77567/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggresomes are cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, observed in many degenerative diseases, that are formed from aggregated proteins by dynein-dependent retrograde transport on microtubules to the microtubule organizing center. Viral E1B-55K protein forms aggresomes that sequester p53 and MRN in transformed cells and in cells transfected with an E1B-55K expression vector. During adenovirus infection, the viral protein E4orf3 associates with MRN in promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies before MRN is bound by E1B-55K. Either E4orf3 or E4orf6 is required in addition to E1B-55K for E1B-55K aggresome formation and MRE11 export to aggresomes in adenovirus-infected cells. Aggresome formation contributes to the protection of viral DNA from MRN activity by sequestering MRN in the cytoplasm and greatly accelerating its degradation by proteosomes following its ubiquitination by the E1B-55K/E4orf6/elongin BC/Cullin5/Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase. Our results show that aggresomes significantly accelerate protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome system. The observation that a normal cellular protein is inactivated when sequestered into an aggresome through association with an aggresome-inducing protein has implications for the potential cytotoxicity of aggresome-like inclusion bodies in degenerative diseases.","['Liu, Yue', 'Shevchenko, Anna', 'Shevchenko, Andrej', 'Berk, Arnold J']","['Liu Y', 'Shevchenko A', 'Shevchenko A', 'Berk AJ']","['Molecular Biology Institute and Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1570, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*pathogenicity', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Multiprotein Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/22/14004 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.22.14004-14016.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Nov;79(22):14004-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.22.14004-14016.2005.,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",PMC1280221,,,,,"['R01 CA064799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The linking cysteine in SU is part of a conserved CXXC motif in which the other cysteine carries a free thiol. Recently, we showed that receptor binding activates its free thiol to isomerize the intersubunit disulfide bond into a disulfide within the motif instead (M. Wallin, M. Ekstrom and H. Garoff, EMBO J. 23:54-65, 2004). This facilitated SU dissociation and activation of TM for membrane fusion. The evidence was mainly based on the finding that alkylation of the CXXC-thiol prevented isomerization. This arrested membrane fusion, but the activity could be rescued by cleaving the intersubunit disulfide bond with dithiothreitol (DTT). Here, we demonstrate directly that receptor binding causes SU-TM disulfide bond isomerization in a subfraction of the viral Envs. The kinetics of the isomerization followed that of virus-cell membrane fusion. Arresting the fusion with lysophosphatidylcholine did not arrest isomerization, suggesting that isomerization precedes the hemifusion stage of fusion. Our earlier finding that native Env was not possible to alkylate but required isomerization induction by receptor binding intimated that alkylation trapped an intermediate form of Env. To further clarify this possibility, we analyzed the kinetics by which the alkylation-sensitive Env was generated during fusion. We found that it followed the fusion kinetics. In contrast, the release of fusion from alkylated, isomerization-blocked virus by DTT reduction of the SU-TM disulfide bond was much faster. These results suggest that the alkylation-sensitive form of Env is a true intermediate in the fusion activation pathway of Env.","['Wallin, Michael', 'Loving, Robin', 'Ekstrom, Maria', 'Li, Kejun', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Wallin M', 'Loving R', 'Ekstrom M', 'Li K', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cysteine', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Isomerism', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/metabolism']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/22/13856 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.22.13856-13864.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Nov;79(22):13856-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.22.13856-13864.2005.,,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",PMC1280236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to develop a versatile and sensitive technique for the pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of HDAC inhibitor activity as monotherapy and in combination therapy. A multiparameter flow cytometric assay was developed initially in healthy donor lymphocytes and leukemia cell lines, and then tested in peripheral blood of solid tumor patients and in bone marrow aspirates of leukemia patients on phase I trials of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275. A technique was developed that allows highly sensitive single parameter determination of HDAC inhibitor activity in as little as 50 microl of whole blood. Multiparameter analysis enabled correlation on a single cell basis of protein acetylation with biologically relevant markers including cell lineage antigens, an apoptosis marker, and PD markers of other anti-cancer agents. The level of protein acetylation can be readily detected and quantified in peripheral blood or in bone marrow aspirates by flow cytometric analysis. The technique described has significant advantages for the PD assessment of HDAC inhibitors as monotherapy and as a component of combination therapy trials.","['Chung, Eun Joo', 'Lee, Sunmin', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Ryan, Qin', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Telford, William G', 'Lee, Min-Jung', 'Kong, Hye Sik', 'Trepel, Jane B']","['Chung EJ', 'Lee S', 'Sausville EA', 'Ryan Q', 'Karp JE', 'Gojo I', 'Telford WG', 'Lee MJ', 'Kong HS', 'Trepel JB']","['Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['35/4/397 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2005 Autumn;35(4):397-406.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)']",,,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) signals through gp130 homodimers whereas leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) exerts its action through a heterodimer of gp130 and the LIF receptor (LIFR). Related haematopoietic receptors such as the erythropoietin receptor have been described as preformed dimers in the plasma membrane. Here we investigated gp130 homodimerization and heterodimerization with the LIFR by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). We detected a FRET signal between YFP- and CFP-tagged gp130 at the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells that does not increase upon IL-6 stimulation. However, FRET between YFP-tagged gp130 and CFP-tagged LIFR considerably increased upon LIF stimulation. Using a BiFC approach that detects stable interactions we show that fluorescence complementation of gp130 constructs tagged with matching 'halves' of fluorescent proteins increases upon IL-6 stimulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that transient gp130 homodimers on the plasma membrane are stabilized by IL-6 whereas heterodimerization of gp130 with the LIFR is mainly triggered by the ligand. This view is supported by the observation that the simultaneous action of two IL-6 binding domains on two gp130 molecules is required to efficiently recruit a fluorescent IL-6 (YFP-IL-6) to the plasma membrane.","['Giese, Bernd', 'Roderburg, Christoph', 'Sommerauer, Michael', 'Wortmann, Saskia B', 'Metz, Silke', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Muller-Newen, Gerhard']","['Giese B', 'Roderburg C', 'Sommerauer M', 'Wortmann SB', 'Metz S', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Universitatsklinikum RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Photochemistry', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection']",2005/10/29 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['118/21/5129 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.02628 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2005 Nov 1;118(Pt 21):5129-40. doi: 10.1242/jcs.02628.,,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cyan Fluorescent Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that CEBPA and Bcl-2 RNA levels correlate highly in low-risk human AMLs, suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis via induction of bcl-2 by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) or its mutant variants contributes to transformation. C/EBPalphap30, lacking a NH2-terminal transactivation domain, or C/EBPalphaLZ, carrying in-frame mutations in the leucine zipper that prevent DNA binding, induced bcl-2 in hematopoietic cell lines, and C/EBPalpha induced bcl-2 in normal murine myeloid progenitors and in the splenocytes of H2K-C/EBPalpha-Emu transgenic mice. C/EBPalpha protected Ba/F3 cells from apoptosis on interleukin-3 withdrawal but not if bcl-2 was knocked down. Remarkably, C/EBPalphaLZ oncoproteins activated the bcl-2 P2 promoter despite lack of DNA binding, and C/EBPalphap30 also activated the promoter. C/EBPalpha and the C/EBPalpha oncoproteins cooperated with nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p50, but not p65, to induce bcl-2 transcription. Endogenous C/EBPalpha preferentially coimmunoprecipitated with p50 versus p65 in myeloid cell extracts. Mutation of residues 297 to 302 in the C/EBPalpha basic region prevented induction of endogenous bcl-2 or the bcl-2 promoter and interaction with p50 but not p65. These findings suggest that C/EBPalpha or its mutant variants tether to a subset of NF-kappaB target genes, including Bcl-2, via p50 to facilitate gene activation and offer an explanation for preferential in-frame rather than out-of-frame mutation of the leucine zipper with sparing of the basic region in C/EBPalphaLZ oncoproteins. Targeting interaction between C/EBPalpha basic region and NF-kappaB p50 may contribute to the therapy of AML and other malignancies expressing C/EBPs.","['Paz-Priel, Ido', 'Cai, Dong Hong', 'Wang, Dehua', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Blackford, Amanda', 'Liu, Huaitian', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Gombart, Adrian F', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Boxer, Linda M', 'Friedman, Alan D']","['Paz-Priel I', 'Cai DH', 'Wang D', 'Kowalski J', 'Blackford A', 'Liu H', 'Heckman CA', 'Gombart AF', 'Koeffler HP', 'Boxer LM', 'Friedman AD']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, CRB 253, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['3/10/585 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0111 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2005 Oct;3(10):585-96. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0111.,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,['R01 HL62274/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both acute and fractionated irradiation result in a high risk of leukemia and thymic lymphoma. However, the exact mechanisms underlying radiation-induced predisposition to leukemia and lymphoma are still unknown, and the contributions of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in particular have yet to be defined. Global DNA hypomethylation is a well-known characteristic of cancer cells. Recent studies have also shown that tumor cells undergo prominent changes in histone methylation, particularly a substantial loss of trimethylation of histone H4-Lys20 and demethylation of genomic DNA. These losses are considered a universal marker of malignant transformation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of low-dose radiation exposure on the accumulation of DNA lesions and alterations of DNA methylation and histone H4-Lys20 trimethylation in the thymus tissue using an in vivo murine model. For the first time, we show that fractionated whole-body application of 0.5 Gy X-ray leads to decrease in histone H4-Lys20 trimethylation in the thymus. The loss of histone H4-Lys20 trimethylation was accompanied by a significant decrease in global DNA methylation as well as the accumulation of DNA damage as monitored by persistence of histone gammaH2AX foci in the thymus tissue of mice exposed to fractionated irradiation. Altered DNA methylation was associated with reduced expression of maintenance (DNMT1) and, to a lesser extent, de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a in exposed animals. Expression of another de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3b was decreased only in males. Irradiation also resulted in approximately 20% reduction in the levels of methyl-binding proteins MeCP2 and MBD2. Our results show the involvement of epigenetic alterations in radiation-induced responses in vivo. These changes may play a role in genome destabilization that ultimately leads to cancer.","['Pogribny, Igor', 'Koturbash, Igor', 'Tryndyak, Volodymyr', 'Hudson, Darryl', 'Stevenson, Sandie M L', 'Sedelnikova, Olga', 'Bonner, William', 'Kovalchuk, Olga']","['Pogribny I', 'Koturbash I', 'Tryndyak V', 'Hudson D', 'Stevenson SM', 'Sedelnikova O', 'Bonner W', 'Kovalchuk O']","['Division of Biochemical Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, Arkansas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/*radiation effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation/*radiation effects', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Histones/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Methylation/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology/*radiation effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['3/10/553 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0074 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2005 Oct;3(10):553-61. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0074.,,"['0 (Histones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib significantly decreased survivin expression and cell viability in KBM5, but much less so in KBM5-STI571 cells. Inhibition of MEK, downstream of the Bcr-Abl signaling cascade decreased survivin expression and cell viability in both KBM5 and KBM5-STI571 cells. In addition, down-regulation of survivin by a survivin antisense oligonucleotide (Sur-AS-ODN) inhibited cell growth and induced maximal G2M block at 48 hours, whereas cell death was observed only at 72 hours in both KBM5 and KBM5-STI571 cells as shown by annexin V staining. Further, the combination of Sur-AS-ODN and imatinib induced more cell death in KBM5 cells than did either treatment alone. Down-regulating survivin also decreased colony-forming units (CFUs) in blast crisis CML patient samples. Our data therefore suggest that survivin is regulated by the Bcr-Abl/MAPK cascade in Ph+ CML.

These compounds inhibited interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent proliferation of BaF3/NPM-ALK cells in an ALK inhibition-dependent manner and significantly blocked colony formation in agar of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells harboring NPM-ALK. Inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation in the ALK+ ALCL-derived cell lines resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic-cell death, while having marginal effects on the proliferation and survival of K562, an ALK- leukemia cell line. ALK inhibition resulted in cell-cycle G1 arrest and inactivation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and AKT signaling pathways.

To clarify the biologic implication of activation loop mutations of the KIT gene, 1940 randomly selected AML patients were analyzed. In total, 33 (1.7%) of 1940 patients were positive for D816 mutations. Of these 33 patients, 8 (24.2%) had a t(8;21), which was significantly higher compared with the subgroup without D816 mutations. Analyses of genetic subgroups showed that KIT-D816 mutations were associated with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and other rare AML1 translocations. In contrast, other activating mutations like FLT3 and NRAS mutations were very rarely detected in AML1-rearranged leukemia. KIT mutations had an independent negative impact on overall (median 304 vs 1836 days; P = .006) and event-free survival (median 244 vs 744 days; P = .003) in patients with t(8;21) but not in patients with a normal karyotype. The KIT-D816V receptor expressed in Ba/F3 cells was resistant to growth inhibition by the selective PTK inhibitors imatinib and SU5614 but fully sensitive to PKC412. Our findings clearly indicate that activating mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with distinct genetic subtypes in AML. The KIT-D816 mutations confer a poor prognosis to AML1-ETO-positive AML and should therefore be included in the diagnostic workup. Patients with KIT-D816-positive/AML1-ETO-positive AML might benefit from early intensification of treatment or combination of conventional chemotherapy with KIT PTK inhibitors.","['Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kohl, Tobias M', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Schoch, Claudia']","['Schnittger S', 'Kohl TM', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K', 'Schoch C']","['Laboratory of Leukemia Diagnostics and Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. susanne.schnittger@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Codon/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63871-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-04-1466 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Mar 1;107(5):1791-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1466.

Analysis of polyphenol contents of tea extracts revealed that not only epigallocatechin gallate, which is a predominant polyphenol of green tea, but also theaflavin that is abundantly present in black tea affords significant chemotherapeutic action by imparting cytotoxicity to human leukemic cells. Electrophoretic analysis of fragmented DNA from treated cells displayed characteristic ladder pattern. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the dose dependent increase in sub-G1 peak. These criteria confirmed that cytotoxic activity of green and black tea was due to induction of apoptosis. Such induction was found to be mediated through activation of caspases 3 and 8, particularly caspase 3 and by altering apoptosis related genes as evident by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax proteins.","['Kundu, Trina', 'Dey, Subhabrata', 'Roy, Madhumita', 'Siddiqi, M', 'Bhattacharya, R K']","['Kundu T', 'Dey S', 'Roy M', 'Siddiqi M', 'Bhattacharya RK']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37 S.P.

METHODS: Patients scheduled for BMT were recruited from 1990 until 1995 at the University Hospital of Ulm, Germany. They were interviewed before transplantation, and the corresponding records were checked in December 2002. Seventy-two audiotaped interviews could be analyzed for 34 coping strategies as defined in the Ulm Coping Manual (UCM). Main outcome measure was survival time post-BMT. RESULTS: On average, the patients were 35 years old, 65% were male, and 56% diagnosed acute leukemia (AL). Four coping strategies were found to show a clear trend towards an association with survival time: emotional support, acceptance, taking control, and compensation. The last strategy was associated with shorter, the others with longer survival. CONCLUSION: We found further evidence for an association between coping and survival. Because of the possible wide-reaching consequences for clinical management, replication of the data is essential.","['Grulke, Norbert', 'Bailer, Harald', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Kachele, Horst', 'Arnold, Renate', 'Tschuschke, Volker', 'Heimpel, Hermann']","['Grulke N', 'Bailer H', 'Hertenstein B', 'Kachele H', 'Arnold R', 'Tschuschke V', 'Heimpel H']","['University Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotheraphy, University Hospital of Ulm, Germany. norbert.grulke@uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Psychosom Res,Journal of psychosomatic research,0376333,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3999(05)00018-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpsychores.2005.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychosom Res. 2005 Nov;59(5):337-46. doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2005.02.006.,,,,,,,,,['J Psychosom Res. 2005 Nov;59(5):347-8.

Phase-solubility analysis showed A(L)-type diagrams with beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD), randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RAMEbetaCD) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD), which suggested the formation of 1:1 inclusion complexes. The solubility enhancement factor of melarsoprol (solubility in 250 mM of cyclodextrin/solubility in water) was about 7.2x10(3) with both beta-cyclodextrin derivatives. The 1:1 stoichiometry was confirmed in the aqueous solutions by the UV spectrophotometer using Job's plot method. The apparent stability constants K(1:1), calculated from mole-ratio titration plots, were 57 143+/-4 425M(-1) for RAMEbetaCD and 50 761+/-5 070 M(-1) for HPbetaCD. Data from 1H-NMR and ROESY experiments provided a clear evidence of inclusion complexation of melarsoprol with its dithiaarsane extremity inserted into the wide rim of the cyclodextrin torus. Moreover, RAMEbetaCD had a pronounced effect on the drug hydrolysis and the dissolution rate of melarsoprol. However, the cytotoxic properties of melarsoprol on K562 and U937 human leukemia cell lines was not modified by complexation.","['Gibaud, Stephane', 'Zirar, Siham Ben', 'Mutzenhardt, Pierre', 'Fries, Isabelle', 'Astier, Alain']","['Gibaud S', 'Zirar SB', 'Mutzenhardt P', 'Fries I', 'Astier A']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacie Clinique, EA 3452, Faculte de Pharmacie, 5 Rue Albert Lebrun, 54000 Nancy, France. stephane.gibaud@pharma.uhp-nancy.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclodextrins/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Melarsoprol/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Solubility']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-5173(05)00599-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2005.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2005 Dec 8;306(1-2):107-21. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2005.09.003.

Stem-loops A and B are self-complementary and bind Gag in their dimeric form, while the C and D elements mediate loop-loop interactions that facilitate RNA dimerization. Packaging also requires nuclear export of viral genomes, and their cytoplasmic transport toward the plasma membrane. For MLV, this is mediated by Gag and Env, and occurs on endosomal vesicles. Here, we report that MLV Psi acts at several steps during the transport of genomic RNAs. First, deletion of stem-loop B or C leads to the accumulation of genomic RNAs in the nucleus, suggesting that these elements are involved in export. Second, in chronically infected cells, mutation of the C and D loops impairs endosomal transport. This suggests that RNA dimerization is essential for vesicular transport, consistent with its proposed requirement for Gag binding. Surprisingly, deletion of stem-loop A blocks vesicular transport, whereas removal of stem-loop B has no effects. This suggests that stem-loop A has unique functions in packaging, not predicted from previous in vitro analyses. Finally, in packaging cells that do not express any Psi-containing RNA, endosomal RNA transport becomes sequence-independent. This non-specific activity of Gag likely promotes packaging of cellular mRNAs.","['Basyuk, Eugenia', 'Boulon, Severine', 'Skou Pedersen, Finn', 'Bertrand, Edouard', 'Vestergaard Rasmussen, Soren']","['Basyuk E', 'Boulon S', 'Skou Pedersen F', 'Bertrand E', 'Vestergaard Rasmussen S']","['IGMM-CNRS UMR5535, IFR 24, 1919, route de Mende 34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cytoplasm', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Products, env/physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/physiology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', '*Virus Assembly']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(05)01150-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2005 Nov 25;354(2):330-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.071.

The KIX domain of CBP can bind simultaneously to two different proteins, providing an additional mechanism for transcriptional regulation. Here we describe the solution structure of the ternary complex formed by cooperative binding of activation domains from the c-Myb and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) transcription factors to the KIX domain. The MLL and c-Myb domains form helices that bind to two distinct hydrophobic grooves on opposite faces of KIX. Compared to the binary KIX:c-Myb complex, significant changes are observed in the structure of KIX at the MLL binding interface in the ternary complex. Two regions of KIX that are disordered in the binary complex become structured in the ternary complex: a flexible loop forms intimate contacts with bound MLL, and the C-terminal helix is extended and stabilized by MLL binding. This structural change results in the formation of additional electrostatic/polar interactions between KIX and the bound c-Myb, providing a structural basis for the cooperativity observed for the ternary complex.","['De Guzman, Roberto N', 'Goto, Natalie K', 'Dyson, H Jane', 'Wright, Peter E']","['De Guzman RN', 'Goto NK', 'Dyson HJ', 'Wright PE']","['Department of Molecular Biology MB2, The Scripps Research Institute 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*CREB-Binding Protein/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",2005/10/29 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(05)01135-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2006 Feb 3;355(5):1005-13. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.059.

In this study, we show that HIPK2 is a desumoylation target for the SUMO-specific protease SENP1 that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Mutation analyses reveal that SENP1 contains the nuclear export sequence (NES) within the extreme carboxyl-terminal region, and SENP1 is exported to the cytoplasm in a NES-dependent manner. Sumoylated HIPK2 are deconjugated by SENP1 both in vitro and in cultured cells, and the desumoylation is enhanced either by the forced translocation of SENP1 into the nucleus or by the SENP1 NES mutant. Concomitantly, desumoylation induces dissociation of HIPK2 from nuclear bodies. These results demonstrate that HIPK2 is a target for SENP1 desumoylation, and suggest that the desumoylation of HIPK2 may be regulated by the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of SENP1.","['Kim, Young Ho', 'Sung, Ki Sa', 'Lee, Sook-Jeong', 'Kim, Yong-Ou', 'Choi, Cheol Yong', 'Kim, Yongsok']","['Kim YH', 'Sung KS', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim YO', 'Choi CY', 'Kim Y']","['Laboratory Research Program, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*enzymology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry/enzymology', 'Endopeptidases/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Export Signals', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/29 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/10/29 09:00'],"['2005/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(05)01251-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2005 Nov 7;579(27):6272-8. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2005.10.010.

We investigated whether microRNA profiles are associated with known prognostic factors in CLL. METHODS: We evaluated the microRNA expression profiles of 94 samples of CLL cells for which the level of expression of 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), the mutational status of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IgV(H) ) gene, and the time from diagnosis to initial treatment were known. We also investigated the genomic sequence of 42 microRNA genes to identify abnormalities. RESULTS: A unique microRNA expression signature composed of 13 genes (of 190 analyzed) differentiated cases of CLL with low levels of ZAP-70 expression from those with high levels and cases with unmutated IgV(H) from those with mutated IgV(H) . The same microRNA signature was also associated with the presence or absence of disease progression. We also identified a germ-line mutation in the miR-16-1-miR-15a primary precursor, which caused low levels of microRNA expression in vitro and in vivo and was associated with deletion of the normal allele.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) method was used for detecting RbAp46 expression levels in BM cells of 140 patients with acute leukemia (AL), 13 with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), 7 with CML in blast crisis (CML-BC) and 32 with non-leukemic disorders. RESULTS: The M-Estimators of RbAp46 were higher in 98 newly diagnosed ALs and 5 relapsed ALs than in 28 ALs in complete remission (CR) and 32 non-leukemic controls (178.23 and 213.65 vs 85.89 and 88.08, respectively).

Among 98 newly diagnosed ALs, the M-Estimators of RbAp46 in M(3) and M(4) were the lowest in all of the subtypes. Furthermore, the RbAp46 expression levels were not correlated with the expression of the fusion genes of bcr/abl, PML-RARalpha, and multidrug resistant gene (mdr1), but were positively correlated with Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) expression levels and negatively with AML1/ETO fusion gene expression.

Over time, this expanding population of poorly/non- functional white blood cells overwhelms the normal function of the body's blood and immune systems. DNA translocations have been found common to leukemia, including Raf mutations. While the cause of leukemia is not known, several risk factors have been identified. In this review, we present an update on the role of AIDS related viruses as an etiology for leukemia. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 and -2 (HIV-1; -2) are the cause for the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Human papillomavirus (HPV), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are specifically implicated in AIDS associated malignancies. However, there are other viruses that are associated to a lesser extent with the AIDS condition and they are Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6). Of these viruses, HTLV-1 has been etiologically associated with leukemia. Recent evidence suggests that EBV, HBV, HCV, and KSHV may also play a role in the development of some types of leukemia. Raf signaling has been shown to aid in the infection and pathogenesis of many of these viruses, making Raf pathway components good potential targets for the treatment of leukemia induced by AIDS related viruses.","['Whitman, Audy G', 'Bryan, Benjaman A', 'Dyson, Ossie F', 'Patel, Dipali K', 'Ramasamy, Dan', 'Anantharaman, Senthilvelan', 'Reber, Adrian J', 'Akula, Shaw M']","['Whitman AG', 'Bryan BA', 'Dyson OF', 'Patel DK', 'Ramasamy D', 'Anantharaman S', 'Reber AJ', 'Akula SM']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, 27834, USA. akulas@mail.ecu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr HIV Res,Current HIV research,101156990,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Virus Physiological Phenomena', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism']",2005/10/28 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/10/28 09:00'],"['2005/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157016205774370384 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr HIV Res. 2005 Oct;3(4):319-27. doi: 10.2174/157016205774370384.,,['EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)'],,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular targeted therapy represents a novel therapeutic approach. The FLT3 tyrosine kinase receptor is mutated in approximately one-fourth to one-third of patients with AML. Normally, binding of FLT3 ligand to the FLT3 receptor leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and activation of the receptor. This in turn leads to induction of intracellular signaling pathways essential to regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Two classes of FLT3 activating mutations have been identified in AML patients: internal tandem duplications (ITDS) and point mutations in the activating loop of the kinase domain. Both mutations result in constitutive FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity and lead to transformation of hematopoietic cell lines in vivo and in vitro. FLT3 ITDs are also an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and disease free survival in patients with AML. Therefore, targeting FLT3 mutations represents a potential therapeutic target for AML. This review will discuss the biology and clinical significance of FLT3 and FLT3 mutations in cell growth and signaling. In addition, I will discuss some of the novel FLT3 inhibitors which are entering clinical trials for AML.","['Advani, Anjali S']",['Advani AS'],"['The Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Desk R35, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. advania@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/physiology/therapeutic use']",2005/10/28 09:00,2005/12/21 09:00,['2005/10/28 09:00'],"['2005/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138161205774370807 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2005;11(26):3449-57. doi: 10.2174/138161205774370807.,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 67-year-old patient, was admitted to our Department because of purpura on his inferior limbs. Family history revealed arterial hypertension, a previous presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, with no sign of liver damage. Physical examination showed purpura of inferior limbs. Laboratory analysis revealed: marked thrombocytopenia (platelet count 5000/microL); hypogammaglobulinemia (9%, immunoglobulin-IgG 634 mg/dL); presence of HCV antibody (negative HCV-RNA); low-titer anti-nuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody (1:80); positive cryoglobulin (polycolonal, IgG-IgM, cryocrit 0.5%). Abdomen ultrasound revealed a mild liver steatosis and bone marrow aspirate megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Platelet kinetics study showed a markedly reduced platelet half-life (<1 day) with evident splenic uptake. The patient was treated with steroids, intravenous Ig and immunosuppressive agent (cyclophosphamide) with only temporary effect; a splenectomy was therefore performed with a subsequent durable increase in the platelet count. Two years later, the patient underwent a prostatectomy for prostate cancer and within the pelvic nodal screening the histological examination unexpectedly revealed features of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, type CCL/small lymphocytic lymphoma; a bone marrow aspirate showed a monotypic CD5+, CD19+, CD23+ B-cell proliferation confirming the diagnosis of CLL. Six months later, a computed tomography scan revealed multiple pathological node enlargements (1.5-3 cm), compatible with a malignant lymphoma. The marked thrombocytopenia may have been an early expression of the lymphoproliferative disease. Otherwise, the association between CLL and ITP might reflect the underlying role of HCV infection causing an immune dysregulation responsible for both pathologies.","['Numeroso, Filippo', 'Baroni, Maria Cristina', 'Delsignore, Roberto']","['Numeroso F', 'Baroni MC', 'Delsignore R']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Intema e Scienze Biomediche, Universita degli Studi di Parma. ffilo@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Ann Ital Med Int,Annali italiani di medicina interna : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di medicina interna,8806705,IM,"['Aged', 'Carrier State', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/diagnosis', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*complications/diagnosis']",2005/10/28 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/28 09:00'],"['2005/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Ital Med Int. 2005 Jul-Sep;20(3):197-202.,,['0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomere length reflects the proliferative history of a cell. In most studies published so far on telomere dynamics after myeloablative allogeneic SCT, recipients had shorter telomeres than their respective donors, thus reflecting ""accelerated aging"" of hematopoietic cells. We evaluated telomere dynamics in patients who underwent transplantation with nonmyeloablative protocols, assuming that the decreased intensity of chemotherapy might prevent telomere attrition. METHODS: Telomere length was measured using FISH-FACS method. Telomeres of recipients were compared to their respective donors. Twenty-three consecutive patients after nonmyeloablative SCT were evaluated. A control group consisted of 10 donor-recipient pairs after conventional myeloablative transplantation. RESULTS: There was significant telomere shortening in both recipients of nonmyeloablative and myeloablative conditioning (0.487+/-0.65 kb, P=0.003; 0.361+/-0.50 kb, P=0.047 respectively). The extent of telomere shortening in the two groups was not different (P=0.64). There was no correlation between the degree of shortening and parameters such as time interval from transplant, age of donor or recipient, and the number of infused cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on telomere dynamics after nonmyeloablative conditioning SCT. The study demonstrates significant shortening of telomeres in recipients in spite of decreased intensity conditioning. Results of this study suggest that the main mechanism following transplantation is the proliferative stress imposed upon the stem cells and not direct damage by cytotoxic drugs. The different kinetics of restoration of hematopoiesis and the probable ongoing process of graft-versus-leukemia in the bone marrow do not prevent the attrition of telomeric ends of chromosomes.","['Lahav, Meir', 'Uziel, Orit', 'Kestenbaum, Meir', 'Fraser, Abigail', 'Shapiro, Hava', 'Radnay, Judith', 'Szyper-Kravitz, Martine', 'Avihai, Shimoni', 'Hardan, Izhar', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Lahav M', 'Uziel O', 'Kestenbaum M', 'Fraser A', 'Shapiro H', 'Radnay J', 'Szyper-Kravitz M', 'Avihai S', 'Hardan I', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Nagler A']","['Medicine A, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petah-Tikva.

To assess the evidence for specific susceptibility genes, we used the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) to analyze 115 candidate genes for linkage and association with diabetic nephropathy. A comprehensive survey of this sort has not been undertaken before. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple tandem repeat polymorphisms located within 10 kb of the candidate genes were genotyped in a total of 72 type 1 diabetic families of European descent. All families had at least one offspring with diabetes and end-stage renal disease or proteinuria. As a consequence of the large number of statistical tests and modest P values, findings for some genes may be false-positives. Furthermore, the small sample size resulted in limited power, so the effects of some tested genes may not be detectable, even if they contribute to susceptibility. Nevertheless, nominally significant TDT results (P < 0.05) were obtained with polymorphisms in 20 genes, including 12 that have not been studied previously: aquaporin 1; B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) proto-oncogene; catalase; glutathione peroxidase 1; IGF1; laminin alpha 4; laminin, gamma 1; SMAD, mothers against DPP homolog 3; transforming growth factor, beta receptor II; transforming growth factor, beta receptor III; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3; and upstream transcription factor 1.

We previously reported that the combination of the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) and the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) traps BCR-ABL inside the nucleus, triggering the death of the leukemic cells. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of IM and LMB on human cells we collected CD34-positive cells from 6 healthy donors and myeloid progenitors from 35 patients with CML. The sequential addition of IM and LMB generated the strongest reduction in the proliferative potential of the leukemic cells, with limited toxicity to normal myeloid precursors. Furthermore, nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis on colonies representative of each experimental condition demonstrated that the combination of IM and LMB was the most effective regimen in reducing the number of BCR-ABL-positive colonies. The efficacy of the 2-drug association was independent of the clinical characteristics of the patients. Our results indicate that strategies aimed at the nuclear entrapment of BCR-ABL efficiently kill human leukemic cells, suggesting that the clinical development of this approach could be of significant therapeutic value for newly diagnosed and IM-resistant CML patients.","['Aloisi, Alessandra', 'Di Gregorio, Sandra', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Guglielmo, Patrizia', 'Mannino, Francesca', 'Sormani, Maria Pia', 'Bruzzi, Paolo', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Venuta, Salvatore', 'Giustolisi, Rosario', 'Messina, Angelo', 'Vigneri, Paolo']","['Aloisi A', 'Di Gregorio S', 'Stagno F', 'Guglielmo P', 'Mannino F', 'Sormani MP', 'Bruzzi P', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Saglio G', 'Venuta S', 'Giustolisi R', 'Messina A', 'Vigneri P']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Section of General Pathology, University of Catania, Via Androne, 83-95124 Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2005/10/27 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/27 09:00'],"['2005/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)66414-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-05-2123 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 15;107(4):1591-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-05-2123.

Somatic mutations identified in the X-linked transcription factor gene, GATA1, in essentially all DS AMkL cases result in the synthesis of a shorter (40 kDa) protein (GATA1s) with altered transactivation activity and may lead to altered expression of GATA1 target genes. Using the Affymetrix U133A microarray chip, we identified 551 differentially expressed genes between DS and non-DS AMkL samples. Transcripts for the bone marrow stromal-cell antigen 2 (BST2) gene, encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein potentially involved in interactions between leukemia cells and bone marrow stromal cells, were 7.3-fold higher (validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction) in the non-DS compared with the DS group. Additional studies confirmed GATA1 protein binding and transactivation of the BST2 promoter; however, stimulation of BST2 promoter activity by GATA1s was substantially reduced compared with the full-length GATA1. CMK sublines, transfected with the BST2 cDNA and incubated with HS-5 bone marrow stromal cells, exhibited up to 1.7-fold reduced cytosine arabinoside (ara-C)-induced apoptosis, compared with mock-transfected cells.

Numerous features with temporospatial relationships were revealed, indicating the coordinated regulation of molecular networks from various aspects of proapoptotic and apoptotic activities in CML. Imatinib mesylate appears to induce mainly the intrinsic pathway of cell apoptosis, whereas ATO induces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated pathway of cell apoptosis, and the combination of the 2 agents seems to more effectively induce the intrinsic, extrinsic, and ER stress-mediated pathways of cell apoptosis, which results in a more effective and efficient induction of programmed cell death in K562 cells.

However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the exit of leukemia cells from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. We reveal that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (FLT-1) modulates acute leukemia distribution within the BM, along VEGF and PlGF gradients, regulating leukemia survival and exit into the peripheral circulation. FLT-1 activation on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells results in cell migration and proliferation in vitro, whereas in vivo FLT-1-overexpressing cells accumulate in the BM epiphysis of nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) recipients and are detected in circulation 2 weeks after inoculation. In turn, FLT-1 neutralization affects leukemia localization (now in the BM diaphysis), increases leukemia apoptosis, and impedes the exit of ALL cells, prolonging the survival of inoculated mice. We demonstrate further that FLT-1-induced cell migration involves actin polymerization and lipid raft formation. Taken together, we show that FLT-1 regulates the BM localization of ALL cells, determining their survival and exit into the circulation and ultimately the survival of inoculated recipients. FLT-1 targeting on subsets of acute leukemias may delay the onset of extramedullary disease, which may be advantageous in combinatorial therapeutic settings.","['Fragoso, Rita', 'Pereira, Teresa', 'Wu, Yan', 'Zhu, Zhenping', 'Cabecadas, Jose', 'Dias, Sergio']","['Fragoso R', 'Pereira T', 'Wu Y', 'Zhu Z', 'Cabecadas J', 'Dias S']","['Angiogenesis Laboratory, Centro Investigacao Patobiologia Molecular, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia Francisco Gentil (IPOFG), Rua Professor Lima Basto, 1099-023 Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*genetics']",2005/10/27 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/27 09:00'],"['2005/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)66416-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2530 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 15;107(4):1608-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2530.

Findings are discrepant for some sites and several studies are subject to a series of methodological limitations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the association of adult height with death attributed to 14 cancer sites using data from the original Whitehall cohort. This is a prospective study of 18,403 middle-aged, non-industrial, London-based, male government employees who were examined in the late 1960s and then followed up for mortality for a maximum of 35 years. RESULTS: There were 11,099 deaths during follow-up, 3101 (28%) of which were ascribed to cancer. Cox proportional hazards regression models revealed modest effects for height in relation to site-specific cancers. Following adjustment for covariates that included employment grade (an indicator of socioeconomic position), body mass index and smoking habit, increased height was associated with elevated mortality rates for cancer of combined sites [hazards ratio per 5 cm increase in height (95% confidence interval); P for trend across height categories: 1.05 (1.03, 1.08); P < 0.001], lung [1.13 (1.06, 1.20); P < 0.001], prostate [1.07 (0.99, 1.15); P = 0.08], kidney [1.20 (0.99, 1.46); P = 0.08], skin [1.35 (1.06, 1.70); P = 0.02] and leukaemia [1.11 (0.96, 1.28); P = 0.02].

However, survival analysis commonly only measures survival during the treatment period (and the period immediately afterwards), and does not provide an estimate of life expectancy, which is often of more interest to patients and to health policy makers. In this paper we propose a method to estimate childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) life expectancy through the integration of traditional survival analysis and life expectancy tables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 305 incident cases registered by the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont in 1979-1991. Vital status on 30 June 2004 was known for 304 cases. Survival analyses were carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Gompertz model, according to the time period of diagnosis and gender. RESULTS: Cumulative survival at 5 years increased from 58.6% (95% CI 48.9-68.3) for cases diagnosed in March 1979-July 1982 to 79.1% (95% CI 70.8-87.5) in March 1987-February 1991 (P = 0.002). Average life expectancy increased from 46.1 years for boys and 42.6 years for girls diagnosed in March 1979-July 1982 to 58.3 and 69.1, respectively, in March 1987-February 1991.

The trial compared cefepime monotherapy with cefepime plus amikacin combination therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with hematological disorders. The JFNSG found that monotherapy with cefepime was, in general, as effective as combination therapy. In terms of subset analyses, defervescence appeared to occur more frequently in leukemic patients and in those with profound neutropenia treated with the dual combination. The conclusion of the trial was that the 1998 guidelines were applicable to the Japanese febrile neutropenic patient population. The JFNSG met again in 2003 to revise these guidelines. An important addition to the guidelines was a distinction between low- and high-risk patients. Low-risk febrile neutropenic patients can receive oral ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, with or without amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, on an outpatient basis, or intravenous (i.v.) monotherapy with cefepime, ceftazidime or a carbapenem. High-risk patients can receive i.v. cefepime, ceftazidime or a carbapenem, or an i.v. dual combination with cefepime, ceftazidime or a carbapenem plus an aminoglycoside. Those patients with a documented infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should also receive a glycopeptide. It remains to be determined whether existing assessment scoring systems apply to Japanese patients; whether a broad-spectrum cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside combination is required as the initial management of patients with acute leukemia and/or profound neutropenia; which antibacterial drugs should be used when first- and second-line agents fail; what are the appropriate oral agents and dosing regimens for low-risk patients; whether serology or the polymerase chain reaction should be the preferred marker for initiating preemptive antifungal therapy; and whether the azoles or the candins should be the preferred antifungal agents.","['Tamura, Kazuo']",['Tamura K'],"['The First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan. ktamura@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Int J Antimicrob Agents,International journal of antimicrobial agents,9111860,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/microbiology', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/blood/*complications/*drug therapy/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neutropenia/blood/*complications/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment']",2005/10/27 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/27 09:00'],"['2005/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0924-8579(05)00210-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2005.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2005 Dec;26 Suppl 2:S123-7; discussion S133-40. doi: 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2005.08.001.

RESULTS: It was indicated by cytoactivity test in vitro that Age only had effect in inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, it couldn't lead to death of cells. Under action of Age, the proliferation of tumor cells was halted at G0/G1 stage of cell cycle, and showed no direct cytotoxic effect by Age. Age could induce lowering of the expression of Rb, Cdk2 and Cdk4, cause halt of tumor cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: The tumor inhibitory effect of Age is realized by way of regulating the activity of cell cycle controlling enzymes to suspend the proliferation of tumor cells.","['Shan, Bao-en', 'Fu, Xiao-mei', 'Hua, Zheng-xiang', 'Li, Qiaoxia', 'Liang, Wenjie', 'Liu, Jiqin', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Liu, Gangsan']","['Shan BE', 'Fu XM', 'Hua ZX', 'Li Q', 'Liang W', 'Liu J', 'Zhang H', 'Liu G']","['Research Center, The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang. baoenshan@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/biosynthesis', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Eleutherococcus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/27 09:00,2007/12/19 09:00,['2005/10/27 09:00'],"['2005/10/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2005 Sep;25(9):825-8.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies of cancer in this population have indicated that Hmong experience an elevated risk of gastric, hepatic, cervical, and nasopharyngeal cancers and experience a reduced risk of breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. Approximately 65,000 Hmong live in California, where there has been a population-based cancer registry since 1988, and the authors used these data to calculate age-adjusted cancer incidence rates and to examine disease stage and tumor grade at diagnosis. Changes in rates during the period studied also were evaluated. These rates and proportions were compared with rates among the non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) populations of California. Between 1988 and 2000, a total of 749 Hmong in California were diagnosed with invasive cancer, and the age-adjusted rate of cancer for the Hmong was 284 per 100,000 population, compared with 362.6 and 478 per 100,000 in the API and NHW populations, respectively. The age-adjusted incidence rates of cancer in the Hmong were elevated for hepatic, gastric, cervical, and nasopharyngeal cancers and for leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Rates were lower in the Hmong for colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers. For gastric cancer and lung cancer, age-adjusted rates increased between 1988 and 2000 in the Hmong, although breast cancer incidence declined. Cervical cancer incidence increased, rates of NHL were declining, and rates for colorectal cancer remained steady between 1988 and 2000. The Hmong experienced later disease stage at diagnosis than other API and generally poorer grade of disease at diagnosis. Hmong experienced lower overall invasive cancer incidence rates than API or NHW populations in California.

Eleven of the 14 patients achieved the first complete remission (CR) after the first induction chemotherapy. We analyzed 9 of 11 CR patients who could be examined immediately after induction chemotherapy (including re-induction therapy). Event-free survival (EFS, 0%) and disease-free survival (DFS, 0%) at 1 year in CR patients with MRD level >or=10(-3) (n = 3) were significantly lower than those in CR patients with MRD level <10(-3) (n = 6) (log-rank test, P = 0.013, 0.013). A lower MRD in BM value after induction chemotherapy was associated significantly with longer survival in the log-rank test. Our data provide evidence that molecular MRD status of BM is a strong predictor of outcome in adult ALL.","['Toubai, Tomomi', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Fukuhara, Takashi', 'Hashino, Satoshi', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Kasai, Masaharu', 'Kakinoki, Yasutaka', 'Masauzi, Nobuo', 'Morioka, Masanobu', 'Kawamura, Tsugumichi', 'Iwasaki, Hiroshi', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Imamura, Masahiro']","['Toubai T', 'Tanaka J', 'Ota S', 'Fukuhara T', 'Hashino S', 'Kondo T', 'Kasai M', 'Kakinoki Y', 'Masauzi N', 'Morioka M', 'Kawamura T', 'Iwasaki H', 'Asaka M', 'Imamura M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. ttoubai@hkg.odn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20461 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Nov;80(3):181-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20461.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytokine has been extensively defined in its role on T-cell regulation and dendritic cell maturation. However, whether this cytokine regulates stem cell proliferation and/or differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we transduced exogenous LIGHT into embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and found it induced their differentiation. The expression of phospho-STAT3, Nanog and Oct-4 was reduced in LIGHT-transduced ES cells compared with wild-type ES cells. LIGHT-transduced ES cells exhibit a low level of SSEA-1 surface antigen and alkaline phosphatase staining compared with wild-type cells. Introduction of LIGHT into ES cells results in the dephosphorylation of MKP-3 and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)5. When ERK5 was inhibited by the specific inhibitor PD184352 or knocked down by ERK5 siRNA, reduction of Oct-4 and SSEA-1 expression was rescued.

Here we show a close correlation between metastatic potential and the resistance to hypoxia- and ER stress-induced apoptosis among the cell lines with differing metastatic potential derived from Lewis lung carcinoma. An apoptosis-specific expression profiling and immunoblot analyses revealed that the expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 increased as the resistance to apoptosis increased. Downregulation of the Mcl-1 expression in the high-metastatic cells by Mcl-1 small interfering RNA increased the sensitivity to hypoxia-induced apoptosis and decreased the metastatic ability. The hypoxia-induced apoptosis was not associated with p53 accumulation, although at present it is not possible to conclude that apoptosis-induced apoptosis is p53-independent. There was no correlation between the expression levels of ER stress-response proteins GADD153, GRP78 and ORP150 and the resistance to hypoxia or ER stresses. In vitro, small numbers of the high-metastatic cells overtook the low-metastatic cells after exposure to several rounds of hypoxia and reoxygenation. In solid tumors initially established from equal mixtures, the proportion of the high-metastatic cells to low-metastatic cells was significantly higher in hypoxic areas. Moreover, the high-metastatic cells were overtaking the low-metastatic cells in some of the tumors. Thus, tumor hypoxia and ER stress may provide a physiological selective pressure for the expansion of the high-metastatic cells overexpressing Mcl-1 and exhibiting reduced apoptotic potential in solid tumors.","['Koshikawa, N', 'Maejima, C', 'Miyazaki, K', 'Nakagawara, A', 'Takenaga, K']","['Koshikawa N', 'Maejima C', 'Miyazaki K', 'Nakagawara A', 'Takenaga K']","['Division of Chemotherapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuoh-ku, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Hypoxia/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/genetics/metabolism']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209128 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209128 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Feb 9;25(6):917-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209128.,,"['0 (Ddit3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (oxygen-regulated proteins)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and siRNAs revealed that expression of ELA2 is regulated by the acute myeloid human leukemia 1 protein (AML1), C/EBPalpha, PU.1 and c-Myb transcription factors. ELA2 has also been investigated as a possible target of the leukemic fusion protein AML1-ETO resulting from the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation. AML1-ETO, like AML1, binds the ELA2 promoter in the myeloid cell lines Kasumi-1 and U937, but unexpectedly fails to significantly alter expression of ELA2. Although AML1-ETO downregulates the expression of C/EBPalpha, changes in C/EBPalpha expression do not correlate with changes in the expression of ELA2. Our observations indicate that AML1-ETO may not be a constitutive repressor of gene expression in every case in which it can associate with DNA, either on its own or in conjunction with C/EBPalpha. Since neither ETO nor AML1-ETO are typically expressed in hematopoietic progenitors, we hypothesize that it is the interactions between AML1-ETO and regulatory cofactors in disease-state cells that alter gene expression programs during hematopoiesis. These protein-protein interactions may not require simultaneous DNA binding by AML1-ETO for the deleterious effects of the fusion protein to be realized.","['Lausen, J', 'Liu, S', 'Fliegauf, M', 'Lubbert, M', 'Werner, M H']","['Lausen J', 'Liu S', 'Fliegauf M', 'Lubbert M', 'Werner MH']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*RNA, Small Interfering', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209181 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209181 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Mar 2;25(9):1349-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209181.,,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.71 (pancreatic elastase II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At disease onset, preleukemic cells are arrested in differentiation at the proerythroblast stage (HS1 stage) and their survival and growth are under the tight control of erythropoietin (Epo). During disease progression, malignant proerythroblasts characterized by Epo autonomous growth and in vivo tumorigenicity can be isolated (HS2 stage). During analysis of transcriptional profiling representive of discrete stages of leukemic progression, we found that the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatase type II gene was turned off in malignant cells. PI-4-phosphatase II is an enzyme that hydrolyses the 4-phosphate position of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P(2)) to form PtdIns(3)P. Using malignant cells engineered to stably express PI-4-phosphatase II, we showed that PI-4-phosphatase II reduced Akt activation level. Moreover, stimulation of malignant cells with Epo-induced PI-4-phosphatase II transcription pointing this gene as an Epo-responsive gene. This study provides first insight for a physiological role of PI-4-phosphatase II in the proerythroblast by controlling Epo responsiveness through a negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.","['Barnache, S', 'Le Scolan, E', 'Kosmider, O', 'Denis, N', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F']","['Barnache S', 'Le Scolan E', 'Kosmider O', 'Denis N', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","['Inserm U528, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Erythroblasts', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209187 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209187 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Mar 2;25(9):1420-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209187.,,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.66 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data currently available, of about 300 patients, suggest that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with beta-emitters in acute leukemia is feasible and safe using a variety of antibodies (anti-CD33, anti-CD45, anti-CD66) and radionuclides (131I, 90Y, 188Re). It appears to reduce the risk of relapse in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients transplanted early in the course of their disease (<15% blasts) to 20-30%. Furthermore, it has shown the potential to safely intensify reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (nonrelapse mortality of 25% compared to relapse rate of 55% within 2 years). Significant improvements in the results of refractory patients will probably depend on the successful further development of RIT with alpha-emitters or the use of a cocktail of antibodies labeled with alpha- and beta-emitters, in a first dose escalation study of 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 in refractory AML (partial) remission could be achieved in 5/18 patients.

The addition of these two variables to the EBMT prognostic score allowed an adequate risk assessment for patients receiving a UD-HCT during 1CP.

We began performing allogeneic BMT from unrelated donors in 1999 to improve the outcome of ATLL patients with no suitable sibling donors. Eight ATLL patients underwent unrelated BMT; five received the conventional conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, while three received a reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Two patients died due to encephalopathy of unknown aetiology on days 10 and 35, and one patient died due to progression of ATLL 25 months after BMT. Five patients are currently alive and disease-free at a median of 20 months after BMT. Proviral human T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed in four cases before and after BMT. HTLV-I proviral DNA load was reduced significantly after transplantation. Unrelated BMT is feasible for treatment of ATLL.

Therefore, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) has recently become an option for treatment of CNS leukemia; however, information, particularly on the long-term outcome of transplant recipients, is limited. We performed allo-SCT in eight pediatric patients with ALL (n=7) or T-cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=1), who had isolated CNS relapse. All patients survived for a median of 70.5 (range, 13-153) months after SCT. Sequelae developed late in some patients: mental retardation (IQ=47) in one patient, severe alopecia in two patients, limited chronic graft-versus-host-disease in three patients, and amenorrhea and/or hypothyroidism in three patients. Except for a pre-school child with post transplant CNS relapse, six out of seven patients show normal school/social performance. Our results clearly indicate a high cure rate of isolated CNS relapse by allo-SCT in pediatric lymphoid malignancies; however, there needs to be further studies to determine which are the appropriate candidates for transplantation and what is the best transplant regimen to achieve high cure rate and maintain good quality of life.","['Yoshihara, T', 'Morimoto, A', 'Kuroda, H', 'Imamura, T', 'Ishida, H', 'Tsunamoto, K', 'Naya, M', 'Hibi, S', 'Todo, S', 'Imashuku, S']","['Yoshihara T', 'Morimoto A', 'Kuroda H', 'Imamura T', 'Ishida H', 'Tsunamoto K', 'Naya M', 'Hibi S', 'Todo S', 'Imashuku S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Osaka, Japan. yoshihara.takao@jp.panasonic.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amenorrhea/etiology/mortality', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/complications/mortality/secondary/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/etiology/mortality', 'Intellectual Disability/etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/complications/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705202 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705202 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;37(1):25-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not known whether the defective expression of each of these genes is independent or whether it reflects a specific methylation abnormality. Here, we investigated the expression of the DCC, p51 and MGMT genes and the methylation status of the 5' flanking CpG region in 17 cell lines established from hematological malignancies. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method showed DCC expression to be absent in 13 of the 17 cell lines and showed expression of both p51 and MGMT to be absent in 5 of the 17 cell lines. The methylation patterns were analyzed with methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) of the 5'flanking region of the DCC and p51 genes and the promoter region of the MGMT gene. Although unmethylated patterns of the CpG region in the DCC, p51, and MGMT genes were observed in all 11 normal controls, abnormal methylation patterns of these genes were found even in many cell lines expressing these genes. A hypermethylation pattern was detected for the CpG region of MGMT and p51 in cells that did not express these genes. In contrast, a hypermethylation pattern was not always detected for the CpG region of DCC in cells with reduced DCC expression. The results of this study indicate that in many hematological cell lines, the DCC, p51, and MGMT genes have been abnormally methylated in the CpG region. Hypermethylation of these three genes may be independent events in each cell line.","['Nakayama, Kazutaka', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Dan, Kazuo']","['Nakayama K', 'Inokuchi K', 'Dan K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Nippon Med Sch,Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,100935589,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, DCC/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Methylation', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/10/26 09:00,2005/12/17 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jnms/72.270 [pii]', '10.1272/jnms.72.270 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nippon Med Sch. 2005 Oct;72(5):270-7. doi: 10.1272/jnms.72.270.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In analogy to the benefit of patients under the age of 60 years from high-dose AraC there are dosage related therapeutic effects in the patients over 60 years in particular for daunorubicin in the induction treatment, and for maintenance versus no maintenance in the post-remission treatment. Utilizing these effects can partly overcome the mostly unfavorable disease biology in older age AML, whereas the role of risk factors involved is not completely understood and the concept of dose-response needs to be requestioned. We recommend an adequate dosage of 60 mg/(m2day) daunorubicin for 3 days in a combination with standard dose AraC and 6-thioguanine given for induction and consolidation and followed by a prolonged monthly maintenance chemotherapy. Further improvements in supportive care may help delivering additional anti-leukemic cytotoxicity. As a novel approach, reduced toxicity preparative regimens may open up allogeneic transplantation for older patients with AML. Other new options like MDR modulators, antibody targeted therapies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are under clinical investigation. A questionnaire study in patients with AML showed that according to patients' self-assessment intensive and prolonged treatment did not result in decreasing quality of life. This finding did not vary by age under or above 60 years. Given the actual median age in this disease being more than 60 years the adequate management of older age AML remains as the major challenge.","['Buchner, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Schumacher, Andrea', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Staib, Peter', 'Balleisen, Leopold', 'Eimermacher, Hartmut', 'Gruneisen, Andreas', 'Rasche, Herbert', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Mesters, Rolf M', 'Serve, Hubert L', 'Kienast, Joachim', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Buchner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Wormann B', 'Schoch C', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S', 'Kern W', 'Aul C', 'Lengfelder E', 'Schumacher A', 'Reichle A', 'Staib P', 'Balleisen L', 'Eimermacher H', 'Gruneisen A', 'Rasche H', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A', 'Mesters RM', 'Serve HL', 'Kienast J', 'Hiddemann W']","['University Hospital, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Schweitzer-Str. 33, D-48129 Munster, Germany. buechnr@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/01/21 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2004/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(05)00140-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2005 Nov;56(2):247-59. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.09.010.

In the developing spinal cord, the origin and fate of radial glial has yet to be determined. One way in which to address this question is to transplant enriched populations of radial glia into the ventricular zone (VZ) region of host embryos to examine the lineage and differentiation pattern of these cells. An indirect selection procedure using immunomagnetic beads (Dynabeads; Dynal Biotech) was used here to isolate spinal cord radial glia. This negative immunoselection procedure resulted in a high yield of radial glia. A fluorescent cytoplasmic dye (Cell Tracker Green CMFDA) was used to label radial glia before transplantation. The role of radial glia as progenitor cells can also be examined using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing retroviral vector. The retroviral vector allows dividing cells in the VZ region of the spinal cord to be tracked by labelling them with GFP. Both techniques were utilised here to successfully label and examine embryonic spinal cord radial glia in vivo after a microinjection of either fluorescently labelled radial glia or replication-incompetent GFP-expressing retrovirus in utero.","['McMahon, Siobhan S', 'McDermott, Kieran W']","['McMahon SS', 'McDermott KW']","['Department of Anatomy/Neuroscience, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Neurosci Methods,Journal of neuroscience methods,7905558,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microinjections', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neuroglia/physiology/transplantation', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology', 'Transfection/*methods']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/05/13 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-0270(05)00320-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Methods. 2006 Apr 15;152(1-2):243-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.09.008.

Concomitantly, treatment of HL-60 cells with the combination of TGFbeta1 and the retinoid partially suppresses ATRA-dependent induction of TRAIL. This is a death receptor ligand of the TNF family implicated in the paracrine mechanism underlying the apoptotic action of ATRA in APL blasts The protein activates the death-receptor-dependent or extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is associated with caspase-8 activation.

In this paper, we investigate the application of the recently proposed k-windows clustering algorithm on gene expression microarray data. This algorithm apart from identifying the clusters present in a data set also calculates their number and thus requires no special knowledge about the data. To improve the quality of the clustering, we employ various dimension reduction techniques and propose a hybrid one.

METHODS: We reviewed a series of 219 patients with HCL, with median follow-up from diagnosis of 12.5 years (range 1.0 -34.6 yrs), treated with either pentostatin (n = 185) or cladribine (n = 34), to compare these agents and assess the potential for cure. RESULTS: Overall response to pentostatin was 96% with a complete response (CR) in 81% and a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 15 years. Response to first-line cladribine was 100% with a CR in 82% and DFS of 11+ years. The relapse rates at 5 years and 10 years were 24% and 42%, respectively, with pentostatin, and 33% and 48% with cladribine. Survival at 10 years was respectively 96% and 100%. CR rates decreased with each sequential relapse through 69% to 45% (P < or = 0.001). Patients achieving CR after first-line treatment had a significantly longer DFS (P = 0.00007) than those achieving a partial response; a similar result was seen after second-line therapy (P = 0.00001). DFS also declined with sequential treatment (P = 0.00005). CONCLUSION: We have shown equivalent efficacies for both agents in the treatment of HCL, with DFS showing no plateau. True cure in HCL remains elusive, but the addition of monoclonal antibodies may be beneficial. Our results suggest that achieving CR should remain the main goal of treatment.","['Else, Monica', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Osuji, Nnenna', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Woodman, Anthony', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Swansbury, John', 'Dearden, Claire', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Else M', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Osuji N', 'Del Giudice I', 'Matutes E', 'Woodman A', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Swansbury J', 'Dearden C', 'Catovsky D']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust/Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), Sutton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21447 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Dec 1;104(11):2442-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21447.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the largest case aggregation to date and focuses on preliminary experience in the off-label use of this hemostatic agent. Data were extracted from the international, Internet-based registry, www.haemostasis.com, accessed in September 2003. The search results were manually cross-checked against monthly summary reports. The physicians providing the cases were contacted individually to approve the use of their cases, supply any information missing from the database, and validate the data already held. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, B-cell or T-cell lymphoma, or aplastic anemia received rFVIIa at total doses of between 18 and 1040 mug/kg body weight. Bleeding stopped in 11 of 24 (46%) patients, markedly decreased in 8 of 24 (33%) patients, and decreased in 4 of 24 (17%) patients. In most patients, the response was achieved within 2.5 hours of administration of rFVIIa. The use of rFVIIa was generally well tolerated -- 1 case of ischemic stroke was considered to be possibly related to rFVIIa administration, but this has yet to be confirmed. A review of these 24 cases submitted to the www.haemostasis.com database suggests that rFVIIa is beneficial in the management of hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia and hematologic malignancies. This warrants further investigation in rigorously controlled clinical trials.","['Brenner, Benjamin', 'Hoffman, Ron', 'Balashov, Dmitriy', 'Shutluko, Elena', 'Culic, Sr Dana', 'Nizamoutdinova, Elena']","['Brenner B', 'Hoffman R', 'Balashov D', 'Shutluko E', 'Culic SD', 'Nizamoutdinova E']","['Thrombosis and Hemostasis Unit, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. b_brenner@rambam.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Factor VIIa/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/complications/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Leukemia/blood/*complications', 'Lymphoma/blood/*complications', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Prothrombin/metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*complications', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107602960501100406 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2005 Oct;11(4):401-10. doi: 10.1177/107602960501100406.,,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '9001-26-7 (Prothrombin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our analysis showed that ES cell-expressed Ras (ERAS) was orthologous to a human pseudogene Harvey Ras (HRASP) and that the promoter and other regulatory sequences were highly divergent. No ortholog of (ES) cell-derived homeobox containing gene (Ehox) could be identified in human, and the closest paralogs PEPP gene subfamily 1 (PEPP1), PEPP2, and extraembryonic, spermatogenesis, homeobox 1 (Esx1) were not expressed by ES cells and shared little homology. The Sox2 promoter was the most conserved across species and the Oct3/4 promoter region showed significant homology particularly in the distal enhancer active in ES cells. Analysis suggested common and divergent pathways of regulation. Conserved Oct3/4 and Sox2 co-binding domains were identified in most ES expressed genes, highlighting the importance of this transcriptional pathway. Conserved fibroblast growth factor response element sites were identified in regulatory regions, suggesting a potential parallel pathway for regulation by FGFs. A central role of Stat3 activation in self-renewal and in a regulatory feedback loop was suggested by the identification of the conserved binding sites in most pathways. Although most pathways were evolutionarily conserved, promoters and genomic structure of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) pathway components were divergent, likely explaining the differential requirement of LIF for human and rodent cells. Our analysis further suggested that the Nanog regulatory pathway was relatively independent of the LIF/Oct pathway and may interact with the Nodal/transforming growth factor-beta pathway.

Here, we show that Ifi204 was transcriptionally activated in response to M-CSF, and FD-Fms cells decreased their growth and committed toward a macrophage morphology; this induction was abrogated when the differentiation signal of the M-CSF receptor was blocked; the Ifi204 gene was also induced during macrophage differentiation controlled by leukemia inhibitory factor; and the Ifi204 gene is expressed in different mature monocyte/macrophage cells. Finally, we showed that enforced expression of Ifi204 strongly decreased IL-3- and M-CSF-dependent proliferation and conversely, favored macrophage differentiation of FD-Fms cells in response to M-CSF. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the Ifi204 gene is activated during macrophage development and suggest that the Ifi204 protein may act as a regulator of the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, this study suggests that other members of the Ifi family might act as regulators of hematopoiesis under the control of hemopoietic cytokines.","['Dauffy, Jeremy', 'Mouchiroud, Guy', 'Bourette, Roland P']","['Dauffy J', 'Mouchiroud G', 'Bourette RP']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR CNRS 5534, Villeurbanne Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0205083 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0205083 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Jan;79(1):173-83. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0205083.

The objective of the present investigation was to examine the putative role of [Ca2+]i store depletion and store-operated calcium (SOC) and receptor-operated cation (ROC) channels in the mechanism by which Delta9-THC increases [Ca2+]i in the cannabinoid-2 receptor-expressing human peripheral blood-acute lymphoid leukemia (HPB-ALL) human T cell line. By using the smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, and the ryanodine receptor antagonist, 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose, we demonstrate that the Delta9-THC-mediated elevation in [Ca2+]i occurs independently of [Ca2+]i store depletion. Furthermore, the ROC channel inhibitor, SK&F 96365 was more efficacious at attenuating the Delta9-THC-mediated elevation in [Ca2+]i than SOC channel inhibitors, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and La3+. Recently, several members of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel subfamily have been suggested to operate as SOC or ROC channels. In the present studies, treatment of HPB-ALL cells with 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a cell-permeant analog of diacylglycerol (DAG), which gates several members of the TRPC channel subfamily, rapidly elevated [Ca2+]i, as well as prevented a subsequent, additive elevation in [Ca2+]i by Delta9-THC, independent of protein kinase C. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis for TRPC1-7 showed that HPB-ALL cells express detectable mRNA levels of only TRPC1. Finally, small interference RNA knockdown of TRPC1 attenuated the Delta9-THC-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i. Collectively, these results suggest that Delta9-THC-induced elevation in [Ca2+]i is attributable entirely to extracellular calcium influx, which is independent of [Ca2+]i store depletion, and is mediated, at least partially, through the DAG-sensitive TRPC1 channels.","['Rao, Gautham K', 'Kaminski, Norbert E']","['Rao GK', 'Kaminski NE']","['Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Center for Integrative Toxicology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1317, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dronabinol/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/biosynthesis', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'TRPC Cation Channels/*metabolism']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0505274 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0505274 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Jan;79(1):202-13. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0505274.

The targeting moiety of an immunotoxin selectively binds to a tumor cell and targets it for death via an attached toxin. Because the toxins are typically of plant or bacterial origin, their clinical use is limited by immunogenicity and nonspecific toxicity. To circumvent these problems, we have begun to engineer immunotoxins containing human pancreatic ribonuclease. Here we describe the generation of ribonuclease mutants designed to evade a ubiquitous cytosolic inhibitor that would otherwise block cytotoxicity. Two mutants retained catalytic activity and were relatively resistant to the inhibitor. To deliver them to human T leukemic cells, these ribonuclease variants were fused to a single chain Fv fragment specific for CD 7. The ribonuclease-sFv fusion proteins bound CD 7(+) T cells and were internalized yet were not cytotoxic. Transfection of the proteins directly into the cytosol reduced cell viability, suggesting that the failure of the immunotoxins to kill cells when added externally resulted from the inability of the ribonuclease moiety to access the cytosol efficiently. Our results indicate appropriate intracellular routing, as well as resistance to inhibition, is critical to the cytotoxicity of human ribonuclease-based immunotoxins.","['Erickson, Heidi A', 'Jund, Michelle D', 'Pennell, Christopher A']","['Erickson HA', 'Jund MD', 'Pennell CA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Cancer Center and Center for Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Protein Eng Des Sel,"Protein engineering, design & selection : PEDS",101186484,IM,"['Catalysis', 'Cytosol/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/genetics', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Ribonucleases/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['gzi073 [pii]', '10.1093/protein/gzi073 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Eng Des Sel. 2006 Jan;19(1):37-45. doi: 10.1093/protein/gzi073.

Therefore, variables such as total dose and also the area under the curve (AUC) that are schedule insensitive are generally insufficient to adequately represent treatment strength. PURPOSE: To establish a descriptor of treatment strength that takes into account the differential contribution of plasma concentrations (C) and exposure times (T) towards the cytotoxic effect and to investigate whether such a pharmacodynamically weighed descriptor is better correlated to the clinical effect than conventional variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The paradigm ""C(N) x T = constant"" (for an isoeffect) incorporates a weighing factor N (concentration coefficient) into the conventional description of the AUC that quantitates the differential contribution of C and T towards the cytotoxic effect. N was to be numerically derived from a multitude of in vitro isoeffect analyses of the major agents in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy from patient samples (n = 57). RESULTS: For cytarabine, N was 0.45, numerically expressing the substantially higher relevance of T versus C for its cytotoxic effect. In a meta-analysis of 49 study arms involving >10,000 patients, neither total dose, dose intensity, nor AUC was correlated to the clinical effect. However, when AUC was pharmacodynamically weighed (N-weighed AUC, N-AUC = C(0.45) x T), this new descriptor was highly significantly correlated to the clinical effect (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The N-AUC concept is able to characterize schedule-dependent agents and is the only descriptor of cytarabine treatment strength actually correlated to the clinical effect in AML.","['Braess, Jan', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Lorenz, Isolde', 'Waxenberger, Karin', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Braess J', 'Fiegl M', 'Lorenz I', 'Waxenberger K', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. jan.braess@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', '*Models, Biological', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/02/14 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/20/7415 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0360 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 15;11(20):7415-25. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0360.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles from 128 adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL were characterized using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. All patients were enrolled in the Italian GIMEMA multicenter clinical trial 0496 and samples had >90% leukemic cells. Uniform phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular data were also available for all cases. RESULTS: T-lineage ALL was characterized by a homogeneous gene expression pattern, whereas several subgroups of B-lineage ALL were evident. Within B-lineage ALL, distinct signatures were associated with ALL1/AF4 and E2A/PBX1 gene rearrangements. Expression profiles associated with ALL1/AF4 and E2A/PBX1 are similar in adults and children. BCR/ABL+ gene expression pattern was more heterogeneous and was most similar to ALL without known molecular rearrangements. We also identified a set of 83 genes that were highly expressed in leukemia blasts from patients without known molecular abnormalities who subsequently relapsed following therapy. Supervised analysis of kinase genes revealed a high-level FLT3 expression in a subset of cases without molecular rearrangements. Two other kinases (PRKCB1 and DDR1) were highly expressed in cases without molecular rearrangements, as well as in BCR/ABL-positive ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic signatures are associated with phenotypically and molecularly well defined subgroups of adult ALL. Genomic profiling also identifies genes associated with poor outcome in cases without molecular aberrations and specific genes that may be new therapeutic targets in adult ALL.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Li, Xiaochun', 'Gentleman, Robert', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Wang, Kathy S', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Foa, Robin', 'Ritz, Jerome']","['Chiaretti S', 'Li X', 'Gentleman R', 'Vitale A', 'Wang KS', 'Mandelli F', 'Foa R', 'Ritz J']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Biostatistical Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Italy', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/02/14 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/20/7209 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2165 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 15;11(20):7209-19. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2165.,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We could not reach any information regarding the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding in acute leukaemia and decided to search this complication in patients with acute and chronic leukaemias and myeloproliferative disorders, retrospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 6-year period, 291 patients with acute leukaemia, 52 patients with chronic leukaemia and 108 patients with myeloproliferative disorders had been followed. Thirty-two cases of overt gastrointestinal haemorrhage episodes (25 upper, 7 lower) were observed during the mentioned period. RESULTS: The frequency of bleeding episodes was 7.1% (32/451) in haematologic malignancies as a whole, 5.8% (17/291) for acute leukaemia, 1.9% (1/52) for chronic leukaemia and 13% (14/108) for myeloproliferative disorders. If the patients with myeloproliferative disorders in blastic phase were analysed separately, the ratio was 30% (6/20). Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, which could be performed in 8 of 25 upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage episodes, revealed erosive gastritis in five patients and duodenal ulcers in three patients. Neutropenic enterocolitis was the underlying cause in all of the seven patients with lower gastrointestinal haemorhage. Five out of the seven patients had acute leukaemia. In 7 bleeding attacks, out of 32, the ultimate result was death. Generally, the haemorrhage was only a contributing cause of mortality. All of the mortality cases were patients with acute leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Especially, the patients with myeloproliferative disorders are prone to develop gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The manifestation is generally as upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastric erosions and duodenal ulcers. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is frequently a problem of the patients with acute leukaemia. It is commonly a sign of neutropenic enterocolitis.","['Soylu, A R', 'Buyukasik, Y', 'Cetiner, D', 'Buyukasik, N S', 'Koca, E', 'Haznedaroglu, I C', 'Ozcebe, O I', 'Simsek, H']","['Soylu AR', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Cetiner D', 'Buyukasik NS', 'Koca E', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Simsek H']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Trakya University, School of Medicine, Tip Fakultesi, 6. kat, Edirne 22000, Turkey. alrsoylu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Dig Liver Dis,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,100958385,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Enterocolitis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Neutropenia', 'Peptic Ulcer/epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1590-8658(05)00378-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dld.2005.07.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Dig Liver Dis. 2005 Dec;37(12):917-22. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2005.07.017.

Lectinocytochemical detection of apoptotic murine leukemia L1210 cells. Cytometry 56A, 89-95]. It was independent of cell line or apoptosis-inducing agent, and can therefore be considered as a selective marker for identification and isolation of apoptotic cells [Bilyy, R.O., Antonyuk, V.O., Stoika, R.S., 2004. Cytochemical study of role of alpha-D-mannose- and beta-D-galactose-containing glycoproteins in apoptosis. J. Mol. Histol. 35, 829-838]. The main goals of the present study were: (1) to determine whether an increased expression of specific GPs also takes place after apoptosis induction in vivo; and (2) to identify additional characteristics of the membrane GP markers of the apoptotic cells. To reach these goals, we studied the expression of alpha-Man-rich membrane GPs in murine leukemia L1210 cells inoculated into abdominal cavities of mice which were then subjected to the action of apoptosis inducer doxorubicin. Another experimental model used in the present work was splenocytes obtained from mice treated with dexamethasone. Lectin-affinity chromatography and PAGE electrophoresis, or PAGE electrophoresis and lectinoblot analysis were applied for isolation of plasma membrane GPs (34 kDa, and high M(W) of approximately 600 and 800 kDa) whose expressions were increased during apoptosis. Triton X-114 treatment of cell membrane samples showed that the apoptotic cell-specific GPs were localized in the peripheral and integral compartments of plasma membrane. Apoptosis in vitro and in vivo was accompanied by an increased expression of the same GP, identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis as the microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1. Other GPs, whose expressions were also increased at apoptosis, were similarly identified as G-protein beta-subunit like (Acc# BAA06185.1) and dystonin isoform beta.","['Bilyy, Rostyslav', 'Kit, Yuriy', 'Hellman, Ulf', 'Tryndyak, Volodymyr', 'Kaminskyy, Vitaliy', 'Stoika, Rostyslav']","['Bilyy R', 'Kit Y', 'Hellman U', 'Tryndyak V', 'Kaminskyy V', 'Stoika R']","['Institute of Cell Biology, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Drahomanov Street 14/16, Lviv 79005, Ukraine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,IM,"['Actins/chemistry', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Comet Assay', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/chemistry', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dystonin', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Galactose/*chemistry', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Lectins/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Statistical', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry', 'Octoxynol', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spleen/cytology']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1065-6995(05)00194-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2005.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2005 Nov;29(11):920-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2005.08.003.

In this study, we demonstrated that a combination treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and TGF-beta1 led to the enhancement of ATRA-induced suppression of cell proliferation, which is accompanied by inhibition of ATRA-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. This effect was preceded by the arrest of cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase linked with pRb protein dephosphorylation, continuous accumulation of p21 and transiently increased level of p27, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases. Inhibition of ATRA-induced apoptosis by TGF-beta1 was associated with an increased level of Mcl-1 protein, an anti-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family, but not with inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Levels of other Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bad, Bak, Bax) were unaffected by simultaneous ATRA and TGF-beta1 treatment, when compared to ATRA alone. Upregulation of c-FLIP(L) protein, an inhibitor of apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), correspond with inhibition of ATRA-induced (autocrine TRAIL-mediated) caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that apoptosis inhibition associated with proliferation block could depend on modulation of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway and regulation of the Mcl-1 protein level. In summary, we demonstrate that the balance of processes leading to regulation of proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells can modulate cell sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing stimuli.","['Soucek, Karel', 'Pachernik, Jiri', 'Kubala, Lukas', 'Vondracek, Jan', 'Hofmanova, Jirina', 'Kozubik, Alois']","['Soucek K', 'Pachernik J', 'Kubala L', 'Vondracek J', 'Hofmanova J', 'Kozubik A']","['Laboratory of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 612 65 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'CD11b Antigen/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tretinoin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00363-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 May;30(5):607-23. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.09.007.

Using cortical precursor cultures, which temporally mimic this in vivo differentiation pattern, we demonstrate that cortical neurons synthesize and secrete the neurotrophic cytokine cardiotrophin-1, which activates the gp130-JAK-STAT pathway and is essential for the timed genesis of astrocytes in vitro. Our data indicate that a similar phenomenon also occurs in vivo. In utero electroporation of neurotrophic cytokines in the environment of embryonic cortical precursors causes premature gliogenesis, while acute perturbation of gp130 in cortical precursors delays the normal timed appearance of astrocytes. Moreover, the neonatal cardiotrophin-1-/- cortex contains fewer astrocytes. Together, these results describe a neural feedback mechanism; newly born neurons produce cardiotrophin-1, which instructs multipotent cortical precursors to generate astrocytes, thereby ensuring that gliogenesis does not occur until neurogenesis is largely complete.","['Barnabe-Heider, Fanie', 'Wasylnka, Julie A', 'Fernandes, Karl J L', 'Porsche, Christian', 'Sendtner, Michael', 'Kaplan, David R', 'Miller, Freda D']","['Barnabe-Heider F', 'Wasylnka JA', 'Fernandes KJ', 'Porsche C', 'Sendtner M', 'Kaplan DR', 'Miller FD']","['Developmental Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuron,Neuron,8809320,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/*cytology/embryology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Contactins', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cytokines/deficiency/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Drug Interactions', 'ELAV Proteins/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Neurofilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuroglia/*physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Organogenesis', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/01/21 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2004/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0896-6273(05)00741-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuron.2005.08.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuron. 2005 Oct 20;48(2):253-65. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.08.037.,,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Contactins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (ELAV Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (beta3 tubulin, mouse)', '111365-29-8 (neurofilament protein M)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib was first shown to inhibit the causative molecular translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL. Because imatinib could also inhibit the activity of KIT, a 145-kD transmembrane glycoprotein, and because gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), the most common mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract, are characterized by expression of a gain-of-function mutation in KIT, imatinib was used in therapeutic trials of GISTs beginning in 1999. The initial success has now resulted in more widespread use of imatinib for the treatment of patients with GIST. Molecular genetic studies have shown that most GISTs possess a KIT mutation in exon 9, 11, 13, or 17. Clinically, GIST patients with KIT exon 11 mutations (ie, the juxtamembrane region) are the most prevalent and sensitive to imatinib. In addition to the inhibitory effect on KIT, imatinib also inhibits the activity of mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRalpha) found in a subset of GIST. What is becoming evident is that there are patients with GIST who lack mutations in KIT or PDGFRalpha, or possess ""imatinib-resistant"" mutations (such as exon 17 mutations in KIT and exon 18 mutations in PDGFRalpha). These patients typically do not respond well to imatinib therapy. Therefore, identifying additional genetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of GIST, independent of KIT and PDGFRalpha, will be important in developing additional anti-GIST therapies. As one might suspect from previous experiences with antitumor therapies, primary and secondary resistance to imatinib is also becoming a major clinical problem in the treatment of this disease. Therefore, new drugs that can serve as alternative therapies in imatinib-resistant patients with GIST or that can be used in combination with imatinib will be needed. As with most recent efforts to derive novel molecular target therapies to treat cancer, improved therapy of GIST will continue to benefit from advances in the molecular characterization of this disease.","['Tarn, Chi', 'Godwin, Andrew K']","['Tarn C', 'Godwin AK']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, 333 Cottman Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-005-0026-x [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2005 Nov;6(6):473-86. doi: 10.1007/s11864-005-0026-x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,78,,,,"['3 U10 CA21661-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106588-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among accessory genes encoded by HTLV-I, the tax gene is thought to play a central role in oncogenesis. However, Tax expression is disrupted by several mechanims including genetic changes of the tax gene, deletion/hypermethylation of 5'-LTR. To clarify the role of epigenetic changes, we analyzed DNA methylation and histone modification in the whole HTLV-I provirus genome. RESULTS: The gag, pol and env genes of HTLV-I provirus were more methylated than pX region, whereas methylation of 5'-LTR was variable and 3'-LTR was not methylated at all. In ATL cell lines, complete DNA methylation of 5'-LTR was associated with transcriptional silencing of viral genes. HTLV-I provirus was more methylated in primary ATL cells than in carrier state, indicating the association with disease progression. In seroconvertors, DNA methylation was already observed in internal sequences of provirus just after seroconversion. Taken together, it is speculated that DNA methylation first occurs in the gag, pol and env regions and then extends in the 5' and 3' directions in vivo, and when 5'-LTR becomes methylated, viral transcription is silenced. Analysis of histone modification in the HTLV-I provirus showed that the methylated provirus was associated with hypoacetylation. However, the tax gene transcript could not be detected in fresh ATL cells regardless of hyperacetylated histone H3 in 5'-LTR. The transcription rapidly recovered after in vitro culture in such ATL cells. CONCLUSION: These results showed that epigenetic changes of provirus facilitated ATL cells to evade host immune system by suppressing viral gene transcription. In addition, this study shows the presence of another reversible mechanism that suppresses the tax gene transcription without DNA methylation and hypoacetylated histone.","['Taniguchi, Yuko', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Yasunaga, Jun-ichirou', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Mueller, Nancy', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Taniguchi Y', 'Nosaka K', 'Yasunaga J', 'Maeda M', 'Mueller N', 'Okayama A', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan. yutanigu@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Carrier State/virology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2005/10/26 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2005/10/26 09:00'],"['2005/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-64 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-64 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 Oct 22;2:64. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-64.,20051022,['0 (Histones)'],PMC1289293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus stocks contained high levels of inhibitory activity that blocked amphotropic, but not ecotropic, retrovirus transduction. When virus stocks were brought to 80 microg/mL each of CSC and PB, complexes of CSC and PB formed. These complexes incorporated more than 70% of the virus particles but less than 0.4% of all other proteins and no detectable inhibitory activity. Purified virus transduced NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts 21 to 186-fold more efficiently than virus that was not purified. In addition, virus purification significantly altered the dose response of transduction. When virus that had not been purified was used to transduce cells, the relationship between transduction and virus concentration was highly non-linear. In contrast, when purified virus was used, transduction increased monotonically and was linearly proportional to virus concentration, except when high doses of virus were used. Interestingly, when high doses of virus were used gene transfer reached a maximum plateau level, most likely because particle-associated amphotropic envelope proteins had saturated the cellular receptors for the virus. Our findings illustrate that retrovirus purification increases the maximum number of genes that can be transferred, reduces the amount of virus required to achieve a given level of gene transfer, and reduces uncertainties about the relationship between the amount of virus used and the number of genes transferred.","['Landazuri, Natalia', 'Le Doux, Joseph M']","['Landazuri N', 'Le Doux JM']","['The Wallace H.

To test whether aberrant methylation of P2 was involved, 47 APL at diagnosis, 16 APL at first relapse, 50 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were tested by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RARA P2 methylation was highly associated with APL (APL: 25/63 vs AML/ALL: 2/75, P<0.0001). P2 methylation occurred at similar frequencies in APL at diagnosis and relapse, suggesting it was an initiating leukemogenic event. In the APL line NB4, RARalpha2 was not expressed, with the untranslocated RARA shown to be P2 methylated. 5-Azacytadine treatment of NB4 led to progressive P2 demethylation and re-expression of RARalpha2, confirming that RARA methylation collaborated with PML/RARA in totally suppressing RARalpha. In APL, RARA P2 methylation was unrelated to gender, age, presenting leukocyte counts and additional cytogenetic aberrations. For APL patients receiving all-trans retinoic acid for induction, P2 methylation did not affect the complete remission rates and survivals.

We show here that, whereas the leukemic KG1a cells are naturally devoid from cellular cytotoxicity, once activated by TNFalpha, they display cytolytic activity toward various cellular targets including CFU-GM. This mechanism is dependent on stimulation of the granzyme B/perforin system. In addition, KG1a cells expressed the NKG2D receptor and its signal-transducing adaptator DAP 10, which were functional as confirmed by redirected lysis experiments. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis of 20 samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (FAB M0-M5) revealed the expression of NKG2D (40%) and other natural cytotoxicity receptors (40% for NKp30, 74% for NKp44, 39% for NKp46) by a pool >15% of leukemic cells.

Moreover, inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis has been indicated as a major contributor of drug resistance in myeloma. The BM microenvironment promotes survival and blocks the apoptotic effects of various cytotoxic agents through the production of cytokines as well as through direct physical interactions. Several antiapoptotic proteins and antiapoptotic signaling cascades have been identified that contribute to the antiapoptotic phenotype of the myeloma cell. In this review, we discuss mechanisms that result in enhanced survival and drug resistance of myeloma cells.

We analyzed within the database of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research the impact of giving posttransplantation G-CSF on the outcomes of allogeneic HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2719 patients who underwent transplantation between 1995 and 2000. These included 1435 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow (BM), 609 recipients of HLA-identical peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSCs), and 675 recipients of unrelated donor BM transplants. Outcomes were compared between patients receiving or not receiving G-CSF within 7 days of HCT according to graft type. Median follow-up was more than 30 months (range, 2-87 months). G-CSF shortened the posttransplantation neutropenic period, but did not affect days +30 and +100 treatment-related mortality (TRM). Probabilities of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival were similar whether or not G-CSF was given.

MLL normally associates with a cohort of highly conserved cofactors to form a macromolecular complex that includes menin, a product of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in heritable and sporadic endocrine tumors. We demonstrate here that oncogenic MLL fusion proteins retain an ability to stably associate with menin through a high-affinity, amino-terminal, conserved binding motif and that this interaction is required for the initiation of MLL-mediated leukemogenesis. Furthermore, menin is essential for maintenance of MLL-associated but not other oncogene induced myeloid transformation. Acute genetic ablation of menin reverses aberrant Hox gene expression mediated by MLL-menin promoter-associated complexes, and specifically abrogates the differentiation arrest and oncogenic properties of MLL-transformed leukemic blasts. These results demonstrate that a human oncoprotein is critically dependent on direct physical interaction with a tumor suppressor protein for its oncogenic activity, validate a potential target for molecular therapy, and suggest central roles for menin in altered epigenetic functions underlying the pathogenesis of hematopoietic cancers.","['Yokoyama, Akihiko', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Smith, Kevin S', 'Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Yokoyama A', 'Somervaille TC', 'Smith KS', 'Rozenblatt-Rosen O', 'Meyerson M', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/10/22 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(05)00979-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2005 Oct 21;123(2):207-18. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.025.,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,,,"['CA116601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating data indicate that deregulated Notch activity is involved also in the genesis of other human cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, medulloblastoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. In these tumours, the oncogenic effect of Notch signalling reflects an aberrant recapitulation of the highly tissue-specific function of the cascade during normal development and in tissue homeostasis.","['Sjolund, Jonas', 'Manetopoulos, Christina', 'Stockhausen, Marie-Therese', 'Axelson, Hakan']","['Sjolund J', 'Manetopoulos C', 'Stockhausen MT', 'Axelson H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Molecular Medicine, University Hospital MAS, Entrance 78, 3rd Floor, SE-205 02 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism']",2005/10/22 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/10/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(05)00727-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2005 Nov;41(17):2620-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.025.

The regulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) is one of the major determinants of GSH homeostasis. The aim of our study was to investigate gamma-GCS gene expression in patients affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: A total of 64 AML samples, including 23 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL or M3) cases, were included in the study. gamma-GCS mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. All patients were evaluated at diagnosis, whereas post-treatment gamma-GCS mRNA levels were assessed at the end of the consolidation therapy in 16 cases. RESULTS: Our data showed that variable degrees of gamma-GCS expression were detectable in AML, likely reflecting disease heterogeneity; in particular, APL cases, compared to the other AML subsets, showed both significantly lower basal levels of gamma-GCS mRNA at presentation and significantly increased mRNA levels after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased levels of gamma-GCS leading to reduced GSH may at least in part explain the higher sensitivity of APL to chemotherapy.","['Carnicer, Maria Jose', 'Bernardini, Sergio', 'Bellincampi, Lorenza', 'Noguera, Nelida Ines', 'Nuccetelli, Marzia', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Federici, Giorgio']","['Carnicer MJ', 'Bernardini S', 'Bellincampi L', 'Noguera NI', 'Nuccetelli M', 'Ammatuna E', 'Breccia M', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Federici G']","['Department of Biopathology and Department of Laboratory Medicine-PTV, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Gene Expression', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/10/22 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2005/10/22 09:00'],"['2005/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(05)00579-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2005.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2006 Mar;365(1-2):342-5. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2005.09.012.

Studies presenting the relative risks for melanoma after external ionizing radiation exposure were in seven categories: (1) The Canadian Radiation Dose Registry, (2) nuclear industry workers, (3) subjects near nuclear test blasts, (4) survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan, (5) airline pilots and cabin attendants, (6) recipients of medical radiation, and (7) radiological technicians. Relative risks for leukemia in each of the studies were used to confirm the likelihood of exposure to ionizing radiation. When studies within a category were compatible, meta-analytic methods were used to obtain combined estimates of the relative risk, and a meta-regression analysis of melanoma relative risk compared to leukemia relative risk was used to examine consistency across exposure categories. Generally, exposure categories with elevated relative risks of leukemia had proportionately elevated relative risks of melanoma. This suggests that people exposed to ionizing radiation may be at increased risk of developing melanoma, although alternative explanations are possible. Future epidemiological studies of ionizing radiation effects should include melanoma as an outcome of interest.","['Fink, Christopher A', 'Bates, Michael N']","['Fink CA', 'Bates MN']","['University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, California 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Aircraft', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Technology, Radiologic']",2005/10/22 09:00,2005/12/29 09:00,['2005/10/22 09:00'],"['2005/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR3447 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3447.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2005 Nov;164(5):701-10. doi: 10.1667/rr3447.1.,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure assessment comprised 3 levels of precision: ever use, gross vs. net appliance-years, and lifetime cumulative exposure hours. In the current study, the authors analyzed data from 3041 interviews of NLL controls, representing an age-stratified random sample of the general populations of 6 counties in Northern Germany. Weighted kappa coefficients for gross vs. net appliance-years for men were 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.46, 0.71) for baby monitors and 0.98 (95% CI = 0.97, 0.99) for cordless phones; for women, the coefficients were 0.68 (95% CI = 0.56, 0.79) and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.94, 0.98), respectively. Weighted kappa values were considerably lower when net appliance-years and lifetime cumulative exposure hours were compared.

The study included the population of children aged 0-17 in the years 1988-2000. Among leukemias, according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers, were counted: lymphoid leukemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, other specified and unspecified leukemias. Number of cases and incidence for the whole group as well as sex, age and descending (rural and urban) distribution of leukemias were calculated. RESULTS: 244 cases of leukemia were reported (152 boys--62.3% and 92 girls--37.7%). The most of children were from urban regions (139-57%). The mean morbidity rate was 29.9 per million (among boys--36.4/mln, girls--23.1/min). The highest morbidity was observed in years 1989-1990. After 1992 year vehemently decrease of morbidity was noted. Incidence fall with the age, the higher was found in the 0-4 years group (58.7/mln). The decreasing incidence was noted in following years of observation only among the youngest children, while the incidence in children 5-17 years was stable. The higher morbidity was observed among children living in urban regions than in rural ones (35.7/mln vs 24.6/mln) and the incidence in urban region decreased. CONCLUSIONS: In the Lublin Region lower percentage of leukemia was observed compared to the values determined for the country. Incidence of leukemia was falling, but the analysis in age-groups proved, that it was caused by the decreasing incidence in children under 5 year. The higher morbidity was noted in urban children than in rural ones.","['Nurzynska-Flak, Joanna', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R']","['Nurzynska-Flak J', 'Kowalczyk JR']","['Kliniki Hematologii i Onkologii Dzieciecej Akademii Medycznej, Lublinie. info@prolab.lublin.p']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Wiad Lek,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",9705467,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2005/10/22 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/10/22 09:00'],"['2005/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wiad Lek. 2005;58(5-6):284-6.,,,,,Wystepowanie bialaczek u dzieci i mlodziezy na Lubelszczyznie w Latach 1988-2000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a part of innate immunity, inflammatory and coagulation responses are lower in patients with underlying disorders than in patients without such disorders, whereas the need for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation is more frequent. Although these patients are older, age-related defects do not appear to be responsible for this lower response, because innate immunity is usually up-regulated in the elderly. Innate immunity seems to be negligibly affected by the direct consequences of underlying disorders, but underlying disorder-related chronic organ insufficiency certainly participates in the observed organ dysfunction, overestimating the infectious insult by itself.

To better understand the genesis of such ectopic lymphoid tissue, this study investigated whether several B cell-tropic innate immune system molecules, known to be elevated in response to inflammatory stimuli, can cooperate in fostering the T cell-independent clonal expansion of mature human B2 cells under conditions of limiting BCR engagement. Notable synergy was observed between BCR coligation with the C3dg-binding CD21/CD19 costimulatory complex, B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF), and IL-4 in generating B cell progeny with sustained CD86 and DR expression. The synergy was observed over a wide range of BCR:ligand affinities and involved: 1) cooperative effects at promoting early cell cycle progression and viability; 2) BCR:CD21 coligation-promoted increases in BAFF receptors that were highly regulated by IL-4; 3) reciprocal effects of IL-4 and BAFF at dampening daughter cell apoptosis typical of stimulation by BCR:CD21 and either cytokine alone; and 4) BAFF-sustained expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 within replicating lymphoblasts. The results suggest that significant clonal proliferation of recirculating B2 cells occurs upon limited binding to C3dg-coated Ag in an inflammatory in vivo milieu containing both BAFF and IL-4. When rare autoantigen-presenting B cells undergo such expansions, both B cell and T cell autoimmunity may be promoted.","['Mongini, Patricia K A', 'Inman, John K', 'Han, Hanna', 'Kalled, Susan L', 'Fattah, Rasem J', 'McCormick, Steven']","['Mongini PK', 'Inman JK', 'Han H', 'Kalled SL', 'Fattah RJ', 'McCormick S']","['Department of Rheumatology, Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York University Medical Center, NY 10003, USA. patricia.mongini@med.nyu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19/physiology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'S Phase', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2005/10/21 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['175/9/6143 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.175.9.6143 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Nov 1;175(9):6143-54. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.9.6143.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF13B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (anti-IgM)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,['R01 AI052189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We purified five human precursor B cell subsets, and assessed and quantified their IGH, IGK, and IGL gene rearrangement patterns and gene expression profiles. Pro-B cells already massively initiate D(H)-J(H) rearrangements, which are completed with V(H)-DJ(H) rearrangements in pre-B-I cells. Large cycling pre-B-II cells are selected for in-frame IGH gene rearrangements. The first IGK/IGL gene rearrangements were initiated in pre-B-I cells, but their frequency increased enormously in small pre-B-II cells, and in-frame selection was found in immature B cells. Transcripts of the RAG1 and RAG2 genes and earlier defined transcription factors, such as E2A, early B cell factor, E2-2, PAX5, and IRF4, were specifically up-regulated at stages undergoing Ig gene rearrangements. Based on the combined Ig gene rearrangement status and gene expression profiles of consecutive precursor B cell subsets, we identified 16 candidate genes involved in initiation and/or regulation of Ig gene rearrangements.

The authors explored a possible association of diazinon exposure with cancer risk in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled in 1993-1997. A total of 23,106 male applicators provided information in a self-administered questionnaire. Among 4,961 applicators who reported using diazinon, 301 incident cancer cases were diagnosed during the follow-up period ending December 2002 compared with 968 cases among 18,145 participants who reported no use. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Two quantitative exposure metrics were used: lifetime exposure days and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days, a measure that incorporates probability of pesticide exposure with lifetime pesticide application frequency. When lifetime exposure days were used, increased risks for the highest tertile of exposure and significant tests for trend for lung cancer and leukemia were observed. No other cancer site showed an association with diazinon for the highest tertile of exposure. Because these results were based on small numbers, additional analyses are necessary as more cases accrue to clarify whether diazinon is associated with cancer risk in humans.","['Beane Freeman, Laura E', 'Bonner, Matthew R', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Hoppin, Jane A', 'Sandler, Dale P', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Dosemeci, Mustafa', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Knott, Charles', 'Alavanja, Michael C R']","['Beane Freeman LE', 'Bonner MR', 'Blair A', 'Hoppin JA', 'Sandler DP', 'Lubin JH', 'Dosemeci M', 'Lynch CF', 'Knott C', 'Alavanja MC']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced/*epidemiology"", 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Diazinon/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'North Carolina/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/epidemiology']",2005/10/21 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwi321 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwi321 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2005 Dec 1;162(11):1070-9. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwi321.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of cases of lung cancer, and patients have a poor 5-year survival rate. Approximately one third of NSCLC patients present with early-stage disease that is amenable to potentially curative resection and multimodality therapy. Several randomized trials now have confirmed the survival benefit with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, as seen in the 1995 meta-analysis from the NSCLC Collaborative Group. The International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Collaborative Group Trial demonstrated a 4.5% improvement in survival for patients with stage I to III NSCLC. Studies from Japan have reported an improvement of 15.4% in the 5-year survival rate among patients with T1N0 disease after they had received adjuvant therapy with a combination of platinum and uracil-tegafur, and an improvement in the 5-year survival of 11% rate favoring chemotherapy with uracil-tegafur in a subgroup analysis of patients with T2N0 disease. Two recently published meta-analyses have estimated a relative risk reduction in mortality of 11 to 13% at 5 years. Significant improvement in the long-term survival rate has been demonstrated for patients with stage IB and II disease by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9633 trial (4-year survival rate, 12%) and the The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group BR.10 trial (5-year survival rate, 15%; risk reduction for recurrence, 40%).

This feasible approach to immunotherapy merits further pre-clinical investigations using human tumor models of hematologic malignancy. METHODS: The aim of our study was to compare the anti-tumor potential of CB mononuclear cells (MNC), matured in the presence of IL-2, to BM, and to determine phenotype and cytokine secretion in IL-2 CB MNC culture during the peak of their anti-leukemia cytotoxic activity. Phenotype change was analysed with flow cytometry, cytokine secretion with ELISA tests and cytotoxic activity with cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: Following IL-2 maturation, the phenotype of CB MNC was remarkably changed. Lengthening IL-2 culture to 8 days significantly increased CD8+, CD16+ CD56+, CD56+ and CD56+ CD8+ populations. Interestingly, FACS analyzes revealed the occurrence of CD8+ CD56+ cells that were not present in non-stimulated CB. Cultures progressively produced higher levels of INF-gamma, TNF-alpha and GM-SCF. The IL-2-activated cells manifested potent lytic capabilities against both NK- and LAK-sensitive tumor cell targets. DISCUSSION: At the peak of cytotoxic activity during 8-day IL-2 CB MNC culture, we found increased numbers of various cytotoxic cells and increased secretion of cytokines that may contribute further to their potential therapeutic effect. The duration of CB IL-2 cultures may be crucial for successful application of CB in transplant situations to boost the CB GvL.","['Derzic, S', 'Slone, V', 'Sender, L']","['Derzic S', 'Slone V', 'Sender L']","[""Children's Hospital of Orange County Research Institute, Orange, California 91006, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interferon-gamma/analysis/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/metabolism']",2005/10/21 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['L301710684852582 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240500319184 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2005;7(5):408-16. doi: 10.1080/14653240500319184.,,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that CD3/CD28-activated T cells, unlike those activated through CD3 alone, might develop into long-lived memory T cells, either with or without systemic IL-2. METHODS: We used MHC class I-restricted TCR transgenic T cells from the OT-1 mouse, specific for the surrogate tumor Ag ovalbumin (OVA), to assess the trafficking kinetics, antigenic responsiveness and anti-tumor efficacy of dual-activated T cells in vivo as a function of IL-2 administration. At days 7, 14, and 28 after transfer, lymph node cells and splenocytes were examined for donor cell persistence and antigenic responsiveness by FACS and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: In IL-2-treated mice, donor CD8+ T cells persisted and developed a memory phenotype, based on CD44 and Ly6c expression at day 28, while mice given no IL-2 had fewer donor cells at all time points. OVA-specific release of IFN-gamma was higher from lymphocytes of IL-2-treated mice compared with no-IL-2 mice (P<0.02 at all time points). In mice challenged with an OVA-bearing subline of the AML leukemia model C1498, IL-2 did not confer added protection from tumor challenge at 1 or 2 weeks after adoptive transfer, but gave improved survival at 4 weeks post-transfer. DISCUSSION: We conclude that exogenous IL-2 is not required for anti-tumor activity of CD3/CD28-activated CD8+ cells early after adoptive transfer, but promotes T-cell persistence that confers disease protection at more remote times.","['Hughes, D P M', 'Baskar, D', 'Urban, F F', 'Friedman, M S', 'Braun, T M', 'McDonagh, K T']","['Hughes DP', 'Baskar D', 'Urban FF', 'Friedman MS', 'Braun TM', 'McDonagh KT']","['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'CD28 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",2005/10/21 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['R04013J6023M53M3 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240500319127 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2005;7(5):396-407. doi: 10.1080/14653240500319127.,,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,"['R01CA92488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA097907-01S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 F32 CA097907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA097907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA097907-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Cytotherapy. 2005;7(5):391-2.

During this period, its causative agent, human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), was found and a crucial role of the viral product Tax in the development of ATLL was disclosed. However, the long latent period after infection with HTLV-1 indicates the need for additional factors for full-blown ATLL, most of which are supposed to be provided by somatic mutations of cellular genes. Recent progress in cell-cycle research has revealed that the uncontrolled and superior proliferative activity of malignant cells is mainly caused by the breakdown of cell-cycle regulation and that most malignancies carry aberrations in p16-pRB and/or p53 pathways. ATLL is not an exception, despite the consistent association of HTLV-1 in primary leukemia cells, and accumulating evidence indicates that the breakdown of these pathways is indeed involved in the leukemogenesis of ATLL, especially in its later steps, which serve as the key events for promotion of indolent ATLL to aggressive ATLL.","['Yamada, Y', 'Kamihira, S']","['Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Disease Progression', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, cdc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/pathology']",2005/10/21 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['L99717722LV0972K [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500244217 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2005 Nov;46(11):1553-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190500244217.,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism for selective homing of ALL cells to preferential sites has long been unclear. Recent reports indicate that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is found on ALL cells and its ligand is highly expressed at sites associated with ALL-induced organ infiltration. This results in chemotaxis, or directed migration of leukemic cells from the bone marrow via the circulation to preferential sites of extramedullary organ infiltration. Because overexpression of CXCR4 on ALL cells is associated with high extramedullary organ infiltration and shorter disease-free survival, numerous pharmacological agents affecting CXCR4 have currently been investigated. The most promising data are available for histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAIs), which have been shown to be safe and well tolerated in phase I clinical trials. In vitro, HDAIs extensively down-regulate CXCR4 protein and mRNA levels. As a result, the ability of CXCR4 ligand to induce cellular migration is impaired. Wider recognition of the role of CXCR4 in ALL and manipulation of this important mechanism may lead to novel approaches in the treatment and outcome of this disease.","['Crazzolara, Roman', 'Bernhard, David']","['Crazzolara R', 'Bernhard D']","['Vascular Biology Group, Division of Experimental Pathophysiology and Immunology, Innsbruck Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria. roman.crazzolara@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/drug effects/genetics/*physiology']",2005/10/21 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['J68P1164324P41V4 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500215027 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2005 Nov;46(11):1545-51. doi: 10.1080/10428190500215027.,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the introduction of the differentiating agent all-trans retinioc acid (ATRA) APL has changed to the best curable subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With ATRA and chemotherapy approximately 70-80% of patients with newly diagnosed APL achieve long-term remission and are probably cured. PML/RARalpha, the molecular fusion transcript of the specific translocation t(15;17) represents not only the target for ATRA but also permits a precise diagnosis and provides a marker for the identification of minimal residual or recurrent disease (MRD). During the last decade, substantial progress has been made with regard to the recognition of prognostic factors and the optimization of the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy. Remaining questions are the role of arsenic and of ara-C in first line therapy of APL as well as the indication of maintenance therapy in the individual patient. Several treatment options exist for patients with APL who have relapsed after ATRA and chemotherapy. Approximately 50% of the patients in first relapse can achieve long-lasting second remission and might be cured with salvage regimens. Currently, arsenic compounds and transplantation procedures seem to be the most promising options in relapsed disease. The role of CD33 antibodies has to be determined in future studies. Refining the molecular monitoring of MRD by quantitative RT-PCR, better elucidation of the biologic mechanisms, and the identification of prognostic factors might be helpful to make further progress in the treatment of APL.","['Lengfelder, Eva', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Weisser, Andreas', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Lengfelder E', 'Saussele S', 'Weisser A', 'Buchner T', 'Hehlmann R']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Klinikum Mannheim, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Wiesbadener Str. 7-11, 68305 Mannheim, Germany. eva.lengfelder@med3.ma.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/genetics/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2005/10/21 09:00,2006/01/21 09:00,['2005/10/21 09:00'],"['2004/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(05)00138-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2005 Nov;56(2):261-74. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2004.08.009.

We have performed a long-term follow-up study of HTLV-1 carriers for 17 years. Based on the findings of this study and other studies, the natural history of HTLV-1 carriers is hypothesized as follows. The major routes of infection of this virus are from mother to child, between spouses, and through blood products. The target of HTLV-1 infection is CD4 positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The number of infected cells is supposed to be increased just after the infection, then decreased in a year. The number of infected cells does not change thereafter during more than 10 years. In 90% of newly infected people, this level is low or medium ranging from less than 0.05% to 5% of PBMCs infected; however, approximately 10% of newly infected people develop into carriers with many number of infected cells as more than 5% of PBMCs infected. Clonal expansion of infected cells is likely to be contributing to the maintenance of the HTLV-1 infection. Replication of certain clones among many infected cells may be accelerated by the expression of Tax protein and some of them develop to have a phenotype to avoid immune surveillance. Finally, some of these clones, which acquired the accumulation of genomic abnormality, develop the pre-leukemic state. The increased number of certain T-cells due to HTLV-1 infection may also cause imbalance of the immune system, resulting in immune dysfunction or inflammatory diseases like myelopathy and uveitis.

It is rare in children. Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, sweating, and abdominal discomfort from an enlarged spleen. The white blood cell count can range from 100-600 ul. CML has three phases: the chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase. Most patients are diagnosed during the chronic phase. Ionizing radiation has been implicated in some cases of CML, but in most individuals no cause is known. The Philadelphia chromosome, an acquired genetic mutation represented by a translocation of chromosome 22 and chromosome 9, drives the leukemic changes in CML. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved in 2002 for the treatment of all phases of CML. Because of its effectiveness, imatinib has become the treatment of choice for most patients with CML. Stem cell transplantation also is an option for eligible patients. It is the only curative treatment for CML. Two drugs under study for patients who cannot tolerate or who become resistant to imatinib are BMS-354825 and AMN107.

Reliable comparisons of SM risk between alternative treatment strategies are lacking. OBJECTIVES: Radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy (CT) and combined chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for newly-diagnosed Hodgkin's disease are compared with respect to SM risk, overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival. Further, involved-field (IF-)RT is compared to extended-field (EF-)RT. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PubMed, EMBASE, CancerLit, LILACS, relevant conference proceedings, trials lists and publications. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs accruing 30+ patients and completing accrual before/during 2000, comparing at least two treatment modalities for newly-diagnosed HD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Individual patient data were collected and assessed for data quality. Trialists submitted additional information concerning methods and data quality. Peto Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for OS, PFS and SM-free survival. Secondary acute leukemia (AL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and solid tumours (ST) were also analysed separately. MAIN RESULTS: 37 trials (9312 patients) were analysed: 15 (3343) for RT vs. CRT, 16 (2861) for CT vs. CRT, 3 (415) for RT vs. CT and 10 (3221) for IF-RT vs. EF-RT.CRT was superior to RT in terms of OS (OR=0.76, CI=0.66 to 0.89, p=0.0004), PFS (OR=0.49, CI=0.43 to 0.56, p<0.0001) and SM (OR=0.78. CI=0.62 to 0.98, p=0.03). The superiority of CRT also applied to early and advanced stages (mainly IIIA) separately. Excess SM with RT is due mainly to ST and is apparently caused by greater need for salvage therapy after RT.CRT was superior to CT in terms of PFS (OR=77, CI 0.68 to 0.77, p<0.0001). OS was better with CRT for early stages only (OR=0.62, CI 0.44 to 0.88, p=0.006). SM risk was higher with CRT (OR=1.38, CI 1.00 to 1.89, p=0.05), although not significant for early stages alone. This effect, also seen in AL and ST separately, was due directly to first-line treatment. Data were insufficient to compare RT to CT.EF-RT was superior to IF-RT (each additional to CT in most trials) in terms of PFS (OR=81, CI 0.68 to 0.95, p=0.009) but not OS. No significant difference in SM was observed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: CRT seems to be optimal for most early stage (I-II) HD patients. For advanced stages (III-IV), CRT better prevents progression/relapse but CT alone seems to cause less SM. RT alone gives a higher overall SM risk than CRT due to increased need for salvage therapy. Reduced SM risk after IF-RT instead of EF-RT could not be demonstrated. Due to the large number of studies excluded because no IPD were received, to the inclusion of many outdated treatments and to the limited amount of long-term data, one must be cautious in applying these results to current therapies.","['Franklin, J G', 'Paus, M D', 'Pluetschow, A', 'Specht, L']","['Franklin JG', 'Paus MD', 'Pluetschow A', 'Specht L']","['University of Cologne, Biometrie, German Hodgkins Lymphoma Study Group, Herderstr. 52-54, Cologne, Germany 50931.

Recently, high expression of BIC was reported in BL in comparison to pediatric leukemia and normal peripheral-blood samples. In this study, we extended our series of BL cases and cell lines to examine expression of BIC using RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and of miR-155 using Northern blotting. Both BIC RNA ISH and qRT-PCR revealed no or low levels of BIC in 25 BL tissue samples [including 7 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive cases] compared to HL and normal controls. In agreement with these findings, no miR-155 was observed in BL tissues. EBV-negative and EBV latency type I BL cell lines also showed very low BIC and miR-155 expression levels as compared to HL cell lines. Higher levels of BIC and miR-155 were detected in in vitro transformed lymphoblastoid EBV latency type III BL cell lines. An association of latency type III infection and induction of BIC was supported by consistent expression of BIC in 11 and miR-155 in 2 posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) cases. In summary, we demonstrated that expression of BIC and miR-155 is not a common finding in BL. Expression of BIC and miR-155 in 3 latency type III EBV-positive BL cell lines and in all primary PTLD cases suggests a possible role for EBV latency type III specific proteins in the induction of BIC expression.","['Kluiver, Joost', 'Haralambieva, Eugenia', 'de Jong, Debora', 'Blokzijl, Tjasso', 'Jacobs, Susan', 'Kroesen, Bart-Jan', 'Poppema, Sibrand', 'van den Berg, Anke']","['Kluiver J', 'Haralambieva E', 'de Jong D', 'Blokzijl T', 'Jacobs S', 'Kroesen BJ', 'Poppema S', 'van den Berg A']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Groningen University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/10/20 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20273 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Feb;45(2):147-53. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20273.,,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since November 1996, 66 children (younger than 18 years) with genetically proven APL received induction therapy with ATRA and idarubicin. Consolidation therapy consisted of three courses of anthracycline monochemotherapy. After November 1999, patients with intermediate and high risk of relapse received consolidation therapy with ATRA and slightly reinforced doses of idarubicin. Maintenance therapy consisted of ATRA and low-dose mercaptopurine and methotrexate. RESULTS: Thirty-nine girls (59%) and 27 boys (41%) were included in this study. The WBC count at presentation was more than 10 x 10(9)/L in 26 patients (39%). Sixty-one children (92%) achieved complete remission (CR). Early deaths from hemorrhage and retinoic acid syndrome occurred in three patients and two patients, respectively. Toxicity was manageable during consolidation and maintenance therapy. No deaths in CR, clinical cardiomyotoxicity, or secondary malignancy occurred. Two patients had molecular persistence at the end of consolidation. Three clinical relapses and two molecular relapses were also observed. Apart from one molecular relapse, all these events occurred among children with hyperleukocytosis. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 17%, whereas disease-free and overall survival rates were 82% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high incidence of hyperleukocytosis in children with APL was confirmed. Besides low toxicity and a high degree of compliance, a risk-adapted therapy combining ATRA and anthracycline monochemotherapy showed an antileukemic efficacy comparable to those previously reported with other chemotherapy combinations in children.","['Ortega, Juan J', 'Madero, Luis', 'Martin, Guillermo', 'Verdeguer, Amparo', 'Garcia, Purificacion', 'Parody, Ricardo', 'Fuster, Jose', 'Molines, Antonio', 'Novo, Andres', 'Deben, Guillermo', 'Rodriguez, Antonia', 'Conde, Eulogio', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Allegue, Maria J', 'Capote, Francisco J', 'Gonzalez, Jose D', 'Bolufer, Pascual', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Ortega JJ', 'Madero L', 'Martin G', 'Verdeguer A', 'Garcia P', 'Parody R', 'Fuster J', 'Molines A', 'Novo A', 'Deben G', 'Rodriguez A', 'Conde E', 'de la Serna J', 'Allegue MJ', 'Capote FJ', 'Gonzalez JD', 'Bolufer P', 'Gonzalez M', 'Sanz MA']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avenida Campanar 21, 46009 Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2005/10/20 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/30/7632 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.01.3359 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 20;23(30):7632-40. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.3359.,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,['PETHEMA Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we have designed a prospective phase II trial in CML, which, for the first time, evaluated the feasibility and safety of molecular end points as surrogate markers to guide through a stratified treatment algorithm within a multicenter trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: As a clinical model, we adopted minimal residual disease (MRD) found in relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in CML. Forty-four patients were enrolled and received the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (IM) at a starting dose of 400 mg/d. The quality of molecular responses achieved then decided on discontinuation of IM or dose escalation up to 800 mg/d, and finally, on application of donor lymphocyte infusions. Results Seventy percent of patients achieved a complete molecular response (CMR), defined as nested PCR-negativity for BCR-ABL in three consecutive samples. Interestingly, in four out of 10 patients who discontinued IM, CMR was durable even after cessation of IM with a median follow-up of 494 days. This suggests the possibility of long-term tumor control in a subset of patients. CONCLUSION: The treatment strategy showed that IM treatment was well-tolerated and highly efficacious in MRD after allogeneic SCT. Moreover, this study demonstrated that evaluation of a molecular end point within a multicenter trial can be a safe and effective tool for clinical decision making.","['Hess, Georg', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Siegert, Wolfgang', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Ledderose, Georg', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Haus, Ulrike', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Fischer, Thomas']","['Hess G', 'Bunjes D', 'Siegert W', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Ledderose G', 'Wassmann B', 'Kobbe G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ullmann AJ', 'Kindler T', 'Haus U', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Huber C', 'Fischer T']","['III.

Although both proteins are transcriptional inhibitors binding similar DNA recognition sequences, they have opposite biologic effects: TEL inhibits proliferation while TEL2 promotes it. In addition, forced expression of TEL2 but not TEL blocks vitamin D3-induced differentiation of U937 and HL60 myeloid cells. TEL2 is expressed in the hematopoietic system, and its expression is up-regulated in bone marrow samples of some patients with leukemia, suggesting a role in oncogenesis. Recently we also showed that TEL2 cooperates with Myc in B lymphomagenesis in mice. Here we show that forced expression of TEL2 alone in mouse bone marrow causes a myeloproliferative disease with a long latency period but with high penetrance. This suggested that secondary mutations are necessary for disease development. Treating mice receiving transplants with TEL2-expressing bone marrow with the chemical carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) resulted in significantly accelerated disease onset. Although the mice developed a GFP-positive myeloid disease with 30% of the mice showing elevated white blood counts, they all died of T-cell lymphoma, which was GFP negative. Together our data identify TEL2 as a bona fide oncogene, but leukemic transformation is dependent on secondary mutations.","['Carella, Cintia', 'Potter, Mark', 'Bonten, Jacqueline', 'Rehg, Jerold E', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Grosveld, Gerard C']","['Carella C', 'Potter M', 'Bonten J', 'Rehg JE', 'Neale G', 'Grosveld GC']","[""Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ethylnitrosourea/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2005/10/20 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)68435-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-1196 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 1;107(3):1124-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1196.

We explored why 51% of 59 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were unable to initiate leukemia in NOD/SCID mice. Increasing the cell dose, using more permissive recipients, and alternative tissue sources did not cause AML engraftment in most previously nonengrafting AML samples. Homing of AML cells to the marrow was the same between engrafters and nonengrafters. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and nucleophosmin mutations occurred at a similar frequency in engrafters and nonengrafters. The only variable that was related to engraftment ability was the karyotypically defined risk stratification of individual AML cases. Of interest, follow-up of younger patients with intermediate-risk AML revealed a significant difference in overall survival between NOD/SCID engrafting and nonengrafting AMLs. Hence, the ability of AML to engraft in the NOD/SCID assay seems to be an inherent property of AML cells, independent of homing, conditioning, or cell frequency/source, which is directly related to prognosis. Our results suggest an important difference between leukemic initiating cells between engrafting and nonengrafting AML cases that correlates with treatment response.","['Pearce, Daniel J', 'Taussig, David', 'Zibara, Kazem', 'Smith, Lan-Lan', 'Ridler, Christopher M', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Young, Bryan D', 'Rohatiner, Ama Z', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Pearce DJ', 'Taussig D', 'Zibara K', 'Smith LL', 'Ridler CM', 'Preudhomme C', 'Young BD', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Lister TA', 'Bonnet D']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', '*Biological Assay', 'Gene Duplication', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2005/10/20 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)68440-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2325 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 1;107(3):1166-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2325.

We analyzed 423 UD-HSCT pairs. Most protocols included T-cell depletion (TCD). All pairs had high-resolution tissue typing performed for 6 HLA loci. Two hundred eighty-two pairs were matched at 10 of 10 alleles (29% were DPB1 matched). In 141 HLA-mismatched pairs, 28% were matched for DPB1. In the 10 of 10 matched pairs (n = 282), the 3-year probability of relapse was 61%. This was significantly higher in DPB1-matched pairs (74%) as compared with DPB1-mismatched pairs (56%) (log rank, P = .001). This finding persisted in multivariate analysis. In the group overall (n = 423), relapse was also significantly increased if DPB1 was matched (log rank; P < .001). These results were similar in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; P < .001) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; P = .013). In ALL, DPB1-matched pairs had a significantly worse overall survival (log rank; P = .025). Thus, in recipients of TCD UD-HSCT, a match for DPB1 is associated with a significantly increased risk of disease relapse, irrespective of the matching status for the other HLA molecules. It is possible that this effect is especially apparent following TCD transplantations and invites speculation about the function of DPB1 within the immune system.","['Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Marsh, Steven G E', 'Mayor, Neema P', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Madrigal, J Alejandro']","['Shaw BE', 'Marsh SG', 'Mayor NP', 'Russell NH', 'Madrigal JA']","['Anthony Nolan Research Institute, London, United Kingdom. bshaw@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*HLA-DP Antigens', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Tissue Donors']",2005/10/20 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)68449-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3121 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 1;107(3):1220-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3121.

We demonstrate that MTAP- T-ALL cells obtained at relapse are as sensitive to L-alanosine toxicity as diagnosis samples. The therapeutic index of L-alanosine can be increased by the use of a MTAP substrate, which protects MTAP+ normal cells. Since MTAP substrates MTA and 5'deoxyadenosine are prone to toxicities associated with adenosine, we synthesized and evaluated a potentially nontoxic MTAP substrate, 9-beta-D-erythrofuranosyladenine (EFA). The cytotoxicity of EFA to hematopoietic progenitors erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-Es) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) was at least 26- to 41-fold less than that of MTA. In addition, EFA selectively rescued MTAP+ MOLT-4 cells from L-alanosine toxicity at 25 microM with negligible toxicity even at 100 microM. As for MTA, significant, albeit incomplete, rescue was achieved at 12.5 microM, but higher concentrations were toxic. EFA at 20 microM or less rescued primary MTAP+ T-ALL cells and normal lymphocytes from L-alanosine toxicity. Collectively, these data indicate that EFA is an effective agent for salvaging MTAP+ cells from L-alanosine toxicity and is superior to MTA due to lower cytotoxicity.","['Batova, Ayse', 'Cottam, Howard', 'Yu, John', 'Diccianni, Mitchell B', 'Carrera, Carlos J', 'Yu, Alice L']","['Batova A', 'Cottam H', 'Yu J', 'Diccianni MB', 'Carrera CJ', 'Yu AL']","['Department of Pediatrics/Hematology-Oncology, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103-8447, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Alanine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Furans/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Thionucleosides/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2005/10/20 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)68405-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2430 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 1;107(3):898-903. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2430.

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used to detect FLT3 gene and FLT3/ITD mutation in 63 ALL cases. RESULTS: Among the 63 ALL cases, FLT3 gene was detected in 41 (61.5%) cases. The positivity rate of FLT3 gene in pre-pre B-lineage ALL, pre-B-ALL, B-lineage ALL and T-lineage ALL cases were 93.3% (14/15), 77.8% (14/18), 41.7% (5/12) and 28.6% (4/14), respectively. The positivity rate of FLT3 gene was significantly higher in pre-pre B-ALL/pre B-ALL subtypes (84.8%) than in B-ALL subtypes (41.7%, P<0.005), and the rate was significantly higher in B-ALL subtypes (73.3%) than in T-ALL subtypes (28.6%, P<0.001). Two cases (3.2%) were found to have FLT3/ITD mutation, which were also positive for myeloid antigen expression and diagnosed as acute mixed-lineage leukemia, showing leukocytosis and high percentage of bone marrow blast cells with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3 gene can be detected in both B-and T-lineage ALL patients, but more frequently in the former. In B-lineage ALL patients, FLT3 gene is more frequent in cases with undifferentiated than those with differentiated blast cells. FLT3/ITD is rarely detected in ALL patients and FLT3/ITD mutation detection might be helpful to identify the genotypes and evaluate the prognosis of acute leukemia.","['Xu, Bing', 'Li, Lin', 'Tang, Jia-hong', 'Zhou, Shu-yun']","['Xu B', 'Li L', 'Tang JH', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. xbzj@fimmu.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2005/10/20 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2005 Oct;25(10):1207-10.,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The numerous advantages of BS have prompted applications not only in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries but in environmental protection and energy-saving technology as well. Glycolipid BS are the most promising, due to high productivity from renewable resources and versatile biochemical properties. Mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL), which are glycolipid BS produced by a yeast Candida antarctrica, exhibit not only excellent interfacial properties but also remarkable differentiation-inducing activities against human leukemia cells. MEL also show a potential anti-agglomeration effect on ice particles in ice slurry used for cold thermal storage.

The optimum pH for digestion of skimmed milk and production of the proliferation inhibition factor was pH 4.8. Nondigested skimmed milk exhibited little suppressive effect on the proliferation of HL-60 cells. An active enzyme involved in the production of cell proliferation inhibitory materials from skimmed milk was purified from the cell-free extract of S. cerevisiae by a series of column chromatographies: DEAE-Sephacel, D-tryptophan methyl ester-Sepharose 4B, Hiload Superdex G-200 and HPLC Mono Q. The homogeneous purified enzyme and exhibited a molecular mass of 33 kDa in sodium dodeceyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and was identified as protease B by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Bovine skimmed milk digested with purified protease B was found to inhibit proliferation activity of HL-60 cells most strongly when digestion was conducted at pH 4.8. The cell proliferation inhibition activity induced by digested skimmed milk was shown to be due to the induction of apoptosis, demonstrated by the formation of apoptotic bodies and fragmentation of DNA in treated cells. The proliferation inhibition factors produced were recovered in the soluble fraction of 92% ethanol, suggesting that the factors were hydrophilic low molecular mass substances derived from skimmed milk.","['Roy, M K', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Tamai, Y']","['Roy MK', 'Watanabe Y', 'Tamai Y']","['Department of Bioresources, Faculty of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Biosci Bioeng,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,100888800,,,2005/10/20 09:00,2005/10/20 09:01,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [received]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [received]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/20 09:01 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1389-1723(99)80221-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s1389-1723(99)80221-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biosci Bioeng. 1999;88(4):426-32. doi: 10.1016/s1389-1723(99)80221-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial with the combination regimen of PC-R (pentostatin/cyclophosphamide with or without rituximab) in 14 patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and 3 patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LL) without monoclonal serum immunoglobulin M (IgM), followed by a maintenance regimen with rituximab (375 mg/m2 every 3 months) for patients exhibiting a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) after 4-6 cycles. Nine patients were untreated, and 8 had been previously treated with 1-3 regimens. The first 9 patients received PC therapy (pentostatin 4 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2), and 8 patients received the same combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: An objective tumor response after PC and PC-R was confirmed in 11 of 17 evaluable patients (64.7%), with 2 CRs (11.7%) and 9 PRs (52.9%). In patients who received rituximab (n = 13) simultaneously or subsequently, the overall response rate was 76.9%. Grade 2/3 nausea and grade 2 vomiting was generally mild based on World Health Organization criteria. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity occurred after 9 of 49 cycles (18.3%), and grade 4 toxicity occurred after 2 cycles (4%). Ten patients were subsequently treated with rituximab every 3 months for 2-9 cycles to date (median, 4 cycles). No patients have had disease relapse to date, and all exhibited stable IgM serum levels. In 3 patients with a PR after completion of chemotherapy, remission has improved further, with normalization of the IgM level in 1 patient and another patient exhibiting a CR. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that PC-R is safe and highly effective in patients with WM. Maintenance therapy with rituximab for WM as a single infusion every 3 months can be administered safely and can improve remission status.","['Hensel, Manfred', 'Villalobos, Matthias', 'Kornacker, Martin', 'Krasniqi, Fatime', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Hensel M', 'Villalobos M', 'Kornacker M', 'Krasniqi F', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. manfred_hensel@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/blood/*drug therapy']",2005/10/20 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/10/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1557-9190(11)70380-8 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2005.n.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2005 Sep;6(2):131-5. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2005.n.039.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD52 is abundantly expressed on malignant lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52 and induces cell death by several mechanisms that are still under investigation. The initial positive results of many clinical studies that explored the activity of alemtuzumab in relapsed and/or refractory CLL have provoked many oncologists to incorporate this agent into the treatment paradigm of this disease. Prophylactic antibiotics for the duration of therapy or until patients are no longer immunocompromised are recommended. This review summarizes the clinical experience with alemtuzumab that eventually led to its approval.

Such epigenetic phenomena can act alongside DNA mutations and deletions to disrupt tumor-suppressor gene function. The methylation status of the promoter-associated CpG islands from 11 well-characterized cancer-related genes was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 60 adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at diagnosis. The frequency of aberrant methylation among the patient samples was 45.0% (27/60) for suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, 31.7% (19/60) for p15, 20.0% (12/60) for retinoic acid receptor beta2, 13.3% (8/60) for p73 and E-cadherin, 5.0% (3/60) for O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase, 3.3% (2/60) for death-associated protein kinase 1 and hMLH1, 1.7% (1/60) for p16, and 0% (0/60) for the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-3 and Ras association domain family 1A. Aberrant DNA methylation was found in AML of all French-American-British subtypes and throughout all cytogenetic risk groups. There appeared to be a trend towards a higher methylation frequency in AML patients with an unfavorable karyotype, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our data indicate that hypermethylation of multiple genes involving fundamental cellular pathways is a common event in AML, which varies greatly in frequency among the genes examined. The accumulation of epigenetic events affecting genes which are involved in regulating cell cycle inhibition, cell adhesion, growth factor signaling, and apoptosis may contribute to the malignant AML phenotype. The growing knowledge of the role of epigenetics in the aberrant silencing of cancer-related genes provides a rationale and molecular basis for targeted therapeutic approaches with demethylating agents in AML.","['Galm, Oliver', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Luders, Christian', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Gehbauer, Gerald', 'Herman, James G', 'Osieka, Rainhardt']","['Galm O', 'Wilop S', 'Luders C', 'Jost E', 'Gehbauer G', 'Herman JG', 'Osieka R']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitatsklinikum Aachen, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Aachen, Germany. oliver.galm@post.rwth-aachen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2005/10/19 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2005/10/19 09:00'],"['2005/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0005-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Dec;84 Suppl 1:39-46. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0005-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results are mixed. To further inquire into human carcinogenicity of DDT, we conducted a mortality follow-up study of 4,552 male workers, exposed to DDT during antimalarial operations in Sardinia, Italy, conducted in 1946 to 1950. Detailed information on DDT use during the operations provided the opportunity to develop individual estimates of average and cumulative exposure. Mortality of the cohort was first compared with that of the Sardinian population. Overall mortality in the cohort was about as expected, but there was a deficit for death from cardiovascular disease and a slight excess for nonmalignant respiratory diseases and lymphatic cancer among the unexposed subcohort. For internal comparisons, we used Poisson regression analysis to calculate relative risks of selected malignant and nonmalignant diseases with the unexposed subcohort as the reference. Cancer mortality was decreased among DDT-exposed workers, mainly due to a reduction in lung cancer deaths. Birth outside from the study area was a strong predictor of mortality from leukemia. Mortality from stomach cancer increased up to 2-fold in the highest quartile of cumulative exposure (relative risk, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-4.4), but no exposure-response trend was observed. Risks of liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia were not elevated among DDT-exposed workers. No effect of latency on risk estimates was observed over the 45 years of follow-up and within selected time windows. Adjusting risks by possible exposure to chlordane in the second part of the antimalarial operations did not change the results. In conclusion, we found little evidence for a link between occupational exposure to DDT and mortality from any of the cancers previously suggested to be associated.","['Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Fadda, Domenica', 'Billai, Beatrice', ""D'Atri, Mario"", 'Melis, Massimo', 'Blair, Aaron']","['Cocco P', 'Fadda D', 'Billai B', ""D'Atri M"", 'Melis M', 'Blair A']","['Department of Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'DDT/metabolism/*poisoning', 'Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/metabolism/*poisoning', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/10/19 09:00,2005/12/20 09:00,['2005/10/19 09:00'],"['2005/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/20/9588 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1487 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 15;65(20):9588-94. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1487.,,"['4M7FS82U08 (Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene)', 'CIW5S16655 (DDT)']",PMC1403737,,,,,['Z01 CP010120-10/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['NIHMS7485'],,,,,,,,,,

They are effective against tumor cells that are resistant to Taxol or vinblastine. We recently designed, via molecular editing and total synthesis, a new class of epothilones represented by 26-trifluoro-(E)-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxy-epothilone B (Fludelone), which has emerged as a lead candidate for clinical development. Treatment of nude mice bearing MX-1 human mammary carcinoma xenografts (as large as 3.4% body weight) with Fludelone (6-hour i.v. infusion, 25 mg/kg, q3d x 5, q3d x 4) led to complete disappearance and de facto ""cure"" (i.e., remission without a relapse for over 15% of the average life span of 2 years). The toxicities induced by bolus i.v. injection could be avoided through prolonged i.v. infusion, which allowed for a 10-fold increase in maximal tolerated dose. Complete remission of MX-1 xenografts was achieved with only one third of this maximal tolerated dose. Parallel studies with Taxol and Fludelone [20 mg/kg, 6-hour i.v. infusion (q2d x 4) x3] against HCT-116 human colon carcinoma xenografts revealed that both drugs achieved tumor remission; however, all Taxol-treated mice relapsed in approximately 1.3 months, whereas the Fludelone-treated mice were cured without any relapse for over 7 months. Furthermore, tumor remission was achieved by Fludelone against SK-OV-3 (ovary), PC-3 (prostate), and the Taxol-resistant CCRF-CEM/Taxol (leukemia) xenograft tumors. Most remarkably, p.o. administration of Fludelone (30 mg/kg, q2d x 7, q2d x 9, q2d x 5) against MX-1 xenografts achieved a nonrelapsing cure for as long as 8.4 months.

Recent data suggest that proapoptotic Bcl-2-interacting mediator (Bim) plays a role as a tumor suppressor in myeloid cells, and that leukemic cells express only low amounts of this cell death activator. We here show that primary CML cells express significantly lower amounts of bim mRNA and Bim protein compared with normal cells. The BCR/ABL inhibitors imatinib and AMN107 were found to promote expression of Bim in CML cells. To provide direct evidence for the role of BCR/ABL in Bim modulation, we employed Ba/F3 cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of BCR/ABL and found that BCR/ABL decreases expression of bim mRNA and Bim protein in these cells. The BCR/ABL-induced decrease in expression of Bim was found to be a posttranscriptional event that depended on signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and was abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Interestingly, MG132 up-regulated the expression of bim mRNA and Bim protein and suppressed the growth of Ba/F3 cells containing wild-type BCR/ABL or imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL. To show functional significance of ""Bim reexpression,"" a Bim-specific small interfering RNA was applied and found to rescue BCR/ABL-transformed leukemic cells from imatinib-induced cell death. In summary, our data identify BCR/ABL as a Bim suppressor in CML cells and suggest that reexpression of Bim by novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibition, or by targeting signaling pathways downstream of BCR/ABL may be an attractive therapeutic approach in imatinib-resistant CML.","['Aichberger, Karl J', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Vales, Anja', 'Kondo, Rudin', 'Derdak, Sophia', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Selzer, Edgar', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Valent, Peter']","['Aichberger KJ', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Krauth MT', 'Vales A', 'Kondo R', 'Derdak S', 'Pickl WF', 'Selzer E', 'Deininger M', 'Druker BJ', 'Sillaber C', 'Esterbauer H', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology- the Center of Excellence in Clinical and Experimental Oncology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2005/10/19 09:00,2005/12/20 09:00,['2005/10/19 09:00'],"['2005/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/20/9436 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0972 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 15;65(20):9436-44. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0972.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the molecular mechanism of immortalization by MLL-ENL we established a Tet-regulatable system of MLL-ENL expression in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells. Immortalized myeloid cell lines were generated, which are dependent on continued MLL-ENL expression for their survival and proliferation. These cells either terminally differentiate or die when MLL-ENL expression is turned off with doxycycline. The expression profile of all 39 murine Hox genes was analyzed in these cells by real-time quantitative PCR. This analysis showed that loss of MLL-ENL was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of multiple Hoxa genes. By comparing these changes with Hox gene expression in cells induced to differentiate with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, we show for the first time that reduced Hox gene expression is specific to loss of MLL-ENL and is not a consequence of differentiation. Our data also suggest that the Hox cofactor Meis-2 can substitute for Meis-1 function.

The novel SFK/Abl inhibitor, dasatinib (BMS-354825), is a promising therapeutic agent with oral bioavailability. Dasatinib has been shown to inhibit growth of Bcr-Abl-dependent chronic myeloid leukemia xenografts in nude mice. Dasatinib also has been shown to have activity against cultured human prostate and breast cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which dasatinib acts on epithelial tumor cells remains unknown. In this study, we show that dasatinib blocks the kinase activities of the SFKs, Lyn, and Src, in human prostate cancer cells at low nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, focal adhesion kinase and Crk-associated substrate (p130(CAS)) signaling downstream of SFKs are also inhibited at similar concentrations of dasatinib.

The small GTPases H-Ras, Rheb, and RhoB and the centromere proteins CENP-E and CENP-F are relevant targets of farnesylation inhibition; however, their relative importance in the antineoplastic effect of FTIs may vary in different cell types at different stages of the cell cycle and at different stages in oncogenesis. Three recent studies argue that Ras-independent and perhaps even FTase-independent properties are important to the antineoplastic action of this class of drugs. In mice, genetic ablation of FTase does not abolish the oncogenic activity of Ras, limiting the original conception of FTIs as an effective means to target Ras in cancer cells. FTase may not be the sole molecular target of these agents, and one study has suggested that FTIs act by targeting geranylgeranyl transferase II. Lastly, we have obtained evidence that induction of reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen species-mediated DNA damage by FTIs may be critical for their antineoplastic action as a class. Together, these findings may alter thinking about how to apply FTIs in the clinic.","['Pan, Jingxuan', 'Yeung, Sai-Ching Jim']","['Pan J', 'Yeung SC']","['Department of Leukemia, General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans']",2005/10/19 09:00,2005/12/20 09:00,['2005/10/19 09:00'],"['2005/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/20/9109 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2635 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 15;65(20):9109-12. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2635.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)']",,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of a direct Coombs test were intermittently positive. The patient was resistant to therapy with steroids and high-dose immunoglobulin. After a splenectomy was performed in February 2001, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet count improved. Her blood counts remained stable, with a hemoglobin level of approximately 110 g/L and a platelet count >100 x 109/L. She continued therapy with itraconazole, valacyclovir, and penicillin. Some months later, the patient was readmitted for fulminant septic infection, which had a fatal outcome. The second patient underwent related allo-SCT for CGL in January 2003. Seven months later, he was readmitted for intraocular bleeding accompanied by severe thrombocytopenia with antiplatelet antibodies. The patient was resistant to steroid and high-dose immunoglobulin therapy. A splenectomy was performed in September 2003. His platelet count normalized and remains stable.

There is no family history of any similar disease. When the patient was 4 months old, she began receiving treatment with recombinant human G-CSF that resulted in a small increase in the neutrophil count sufficient for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infection. An analysis of complementary DNA for the patient's G-CSF receptor revealed a 3-base pair deletion in the juxtamembrane intracellular sequence. This deletion at the beginning of exon 16 was thought to be caused by alternative splicing; analysis of the DNA revealed a G-to-A point mutation of the final nucleotide of intron 15. To evaluate the functional activity of the G-CSF receptor with this 3-base pair deletion of the juxtamembrane region, we transfected this G-CSF receptor mutant into an interleukin 3-dependent cell line, BAF/3. BAF/3 cells expressing the mutant G-CSF receptor showed augmented proliferation activity in response to G-CSF compared with cells having the wild-type G-CSF receptor. Although the proliferation signal of G-CSF in normal hematopoiesis is transduced through the activation of MAP kinases, this G-CSF receptor mutant showed decreased activation of ERKI/2 in response to G-CSF compared with the wild type, but the transduced sig-nal for Stat3 activation by G-CSF was of the same magnitude as that of the wild-type G-CSF receptor. This result means that the augmented proliferation activity in response to G-CSF that we observed in cells having the G-CSF receptor gene with the 3-base pair deletion is transduced through an intracellular signaling pathway other than MAP kinase. Because SCN patients with a mutation in the G-CSF receptor frequently develop leukemia, this 3-base pair deletion in the juxtamembrane sequence of the G-CSF receptor gene in this patient may be one step in the course of leukemic transformation.","['Yokoyama, Toshihiro', 'Okamura, Seiichi', 'Asano, Yoshinobu', 'Kamezaki, Kenjirou', 'Numata, Akihiko', 'Kakumitsu, Haruko', 'Shide, Koutarou', 'Nakashima, Hitoshi', 'Taisuke, Kanaji', 'Sekine, Yuichi', 'Mizuno, Yumi', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Matsuda, Tadashi', 'Harada, Mine', 'Yoshiyuki, Niho', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Yokoyama T', 'Okamura S', 'Asano Y', 'Kamezaki K', 'Numata A', 'Kakumitsu H', 'Shide K', 'Nakashima H', 'Taisuke K', 'Sekine Y', 'Mizuno Y', 'Okamura J', 'Matsuda T', 'Harada M', 'Yoshiyuki N', 'Shimoda K']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medivine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome']",2005/10/19 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/10/19 09:00'],"['2005/10/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/ijh97.05010 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Jul;82(1):28-34. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.05010.,,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were either cultured under normoxic conditions or were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting HIF-1alpha or Mcl-1 mRNA and then immediately exposed to A/R. As controls, non-transfected HBE1 cells and cells transfected with scrambled RNA duplexes were subjected to A/R. Apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and RNAi was assessed by knockdown of HIF-1alpha and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and Western blots. HBE1 cells transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting either HIF-1alpha or Mcl-1 and subjected to A/R manifested considerable apoptosis, a finding not observed in either non-transfected cells or cells transfected with scrambled RNA duplexes. Specific knockdown of mRNA and protein expression by RNAi in HBE1 cells after A/R was shown for siRNA duplexes targeting either HIF-1alpha or Mcl-1. Unexpectedly, knockdown of HIF-1alpha induced parallel knockdown of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression, whereas Mcl-1 knockdown had no noticeable effect on HIF-1alpha expression. Thus, although both of these proteins were shown to be anti-apoptotic, the action of HIF-1alpha appeared to be mediated in part via Mcl-1.","['Liu, Xiu-Huai', 'Yu, Erik Z', 'Li, Ying-Yue', 'Kagan, Elliott']","['Liu XH', 'Yu EZ', 'Li YY', 'Kagan E']","['Department of Pathology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799, USA. xliu@usuhs.mil']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Bronchi/*metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Respiratory Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/10/18 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20683 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2006 Mar 1;97(4):755-65. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20683.,,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['AI-55592/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax has been studied extensively with respect to its role in transcriptional transactivation and its involvement in the up-regulation of a number of cellular genes during the process of oncogenic transformation. These processes are dependent on Tax localization to the nucleus where it interacts with a number of cellular transcription factors during its course of nuclear action. However, there is mounting evidence suggesting that Tax may shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, localize to several cytoplasmic organelles with subsequent secretion from both Tax-transfected cells as well as HTLV-1-infected cells. In addition, the presence of cell-free Tax in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was recently demonstrated to occur during all stages of HAM/TSP. This has brought about an increased interest in the cytoplasmic localization of Tax and the implications this localization may have with respect to the progression of HTLV-1-associated disease processes. This review addresses the functional implications relevant to the localization and accumulation of Tax in the cytoplasm including the Tax amino acid signals and cellular protein interactions that may regulate this process. Specifically, we have discussed three important processes associated with the cytoplasmic localization of Tax.

Gene transcription is regulated by a complex series of epigenetic modifications, i.e., histone modification such as methylation and acetylation, events determined by the enzymatic activity of histone methyltransferases, and histone acetyltransferases, respectively, the latter counterbalanced by histone deacetylases (HDAC). Acetylation of histones facilitates destabilization of DNA-nucleosome interaction and renders DNA more accessible to transcription factors. Methylation of different specific lysine residues of histones is differently linked to euchromatin (transcripted DNA) or heterochromatin (silenced DNA). On the other hand, methylation of the promoter regions of some genes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) leads to transcriptional silencing and is a common mechanism to regulate gene expression. In normal eukaryotic cells, DNA methylation and histone acetylation are interdependent and maintain equilibrium, allowing temporal expression of genes. In neoplastic cells, this balance is frequently disrupted. In leukemic cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of genes critical for cell cycle and maturation is frequent, and DNMTs were found to be overexpressed, findings paralleled by evidence of transcriptional repression of downstream genes. Therefore, the combination of HDAC and DNMT inhibitors has been considered to be a possible therapeutic approach to restore normal gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other diseases. Human AML1/ETO Kasumi cells were exposed to the HDAC inhibitor D1 (O-n-butanoil-2,3-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D: -mannofuranoside) and 5-aza-deoxycytidine (decitabine) alone and in combination. Histone acetylation as measured by flow cytometry was increased following treatment with D1 and the combination of D1 and decitabine. Addition of D1 alone or in combination with decitabine also led to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Thus, treatment of AML with HDAC inhibitors such as D1 and DNMT inhibitors such as decitabine might have clinical benefit for patients, especially these presenting subtypes of AML, like AML1/ETO, in which the leukemogenic mechanism involves corepressor protein complexes containing HDAC and DNMT.","['Gozzini, Antonella', 'Santini, Valeria']","['Gozzini A', 'Santini V']","['UF Ematologia, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Policlinico di Careggi, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mannose/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/10/18 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0006-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Dec;84 Suppl 1:54-60. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0006-z.,,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (O-n-butanoyl-2,3-O-isopropylidenemannofuranoside)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intratumoral release of IFN-gamma had two crucial effects: inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on tumor cells. Despite ubiquitous expression of H7(a), dissemination of a few H7(a)-specific T cells in extralymphoid organs caused neither graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) nor vitiligo because host nonhematopoietic cells were protected by their low expression of MHC class I.

Wt p53 overexpression was associated with a significant reduction of bcr-abl expression levels resulting, at least in part, from post-transcriptional events affecting the stability of p210 bcr-abl fusion protein. Moreover, we demonstrated that p53 overexpression enhances the commitment to the apoptotic death fate of K562 following its in vitro exposure to 1 microM STI571.

To understand the expression of PDGF-A, PDGF-B and the beta-receptor (PDGF-Rbeta) in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, we used an immunohistochemical method to stain formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues in 5 patients with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, 15 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 23 with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Abundant PDGF-A, rather than PDGF-B, was expressed in normal B cell differentiation. There was no difference in the expression of PDGF-A and PDGF-B between patients with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and patients with malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. Among the patients with B-CLL, the expression of PDGF-B was much stronger than the expression of PDGF-A, and 18 of the patients had coexpression of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta. A larger proportion of patients with B-CLL than with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had expression of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta. In conclusion, PDGF-A expression in all stages of B lymphocyte differentiation suggests that it is important in B cell differentiation and proliferation. Expression of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta suggests that autocrine signaling of PDGF may be important in malignant transformation of B-CLL.

We demonstrate that Mtgr1 associates with mSin3A, N-CoR, and histone deacetylase 3 and that when tethered to DNA, Mtgr1 represses transcription, suggesting that Mtgr1 also acts as a transcriptional corepressor. To define the biological function of Mtgr1, we created Mtgr1-null mice. These mice are proportionally smaller than their littermates during embryogenesis and throughout their life span but otherwise develop normally. However, these mice display a progressive reduction in the secretory epithelial cell lineage in the small intestine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 111 patients with APL. Arsenic trioxide was infused at 0.15 mg/kg daily dose, until complete remission was achieved. Then, after 28 days of rest, arsenic trioxide was infused daily for 28 days as consolidation therapy. We studied minimal residual disease (MRD) by semi-sensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: Complete remission was observed in 95 patients (85.6%). With the median (range) follow-up period of 16.5 (1-57) months, 1- and 2-year disease-free survival was 88.3% and 63.7%, respectively; 24 patients relapsed, 19 of whom achieved a second complete remission, again by arsenic trioxide. Third and fourth remissions were seen in some relapsed patients, again by arsenic trioxide. For patients in complete remission, 1- and 3-year survival was 95.5% and 87.6%, respectively. MRD was positive in four (8.3%) out of 48 cases during 1 year after remission induction; three of them relapsed clinically. CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic trioxide is effective as first-line treatment for APL.

The generation and removal of the PPT primer requires specific cleavages by the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptases; removal of the PPT primer defines the left end of the linear viral DNA. We replaced the endogenous PPT from RSVP(A)Z, a replication-competent shuttle vector based on Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), with alternate retroviral PPTs and the duck hepatitis B virus ""PPT."" Viruses in which the endogenous RSV PPT was replaced with alternate PPTs had lower relative titers than the wild-type virus. 2-LTR circle junction analysis showed that the alternate PPTs caused significant decreases in the fraction of viral DNAs with complete (consensus) ends and significant increases in the insertion of part or all of the PPT at the 2-LTR circle junctions. The last two nucleotides in the 3' end of the RSV PPT are GA. Examination of the (mis)cleavages of the alternate PPTs revealed preferential cleavages after GA dinucleotide sequences. Replacement of the terminal 3' A of the RSV PPT with G caused a preferential miscleavage at a GA sequence spanning the PPT-U3 boundary, resulting in the deletion of the terminal adenine normally present at the 5' end of the U3.

Packaging of virus-encoded RNA is selective, with virions virtually devoid of spliced env mRNA and highly enriched for unspliced genome. Except for primer tRNA, it is unclear whether packaged host RNAs are randomly sampled from the cell or specifically encapsidated. To address possible biases in host RNA sampling, the relative abundances of several host RNAs in MLV particles and in producer cells were compared. Using 7SL RNA as a standard, some cellular RNAs, such as those of the Ro RNP, were found to be enriched in MLV particles in that their ratios relative to 7SL differed little, if at all, from their ratios in cells. Some RNAs were underrepresented, with ratios relative to 7SL several orders of magnitude lower in virions than in cells, while others displayed intermediate values. At least some enriched RNAs were encapsidated by genome-defective nucleocapsid mutants. Virion RNAs were not a random sample of the cytosol as a whole, since some cytoplasmic RNAs like tRNA(Met) were vastly underrepresented, while U6 spliceosomal RNA, which functions in the nucleus, was enriched. Real-time PCR demonstrated that env mRNA, although several orders of magnitude less abundant than unspliced viral RNA, was slightly enriched relative to actin mRNA in virions. These data demonstrate that certain host RNAs are nearly as enriched in virions as genomic RNA and suggest that Psi- mRNAs and some other host RNAs may be specifically excluded from assembly sites.","['Onafuwa-Nuga, Adewunmi A', 'King, Steven R', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Onafuwa-Nuga AA', 'King SR', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, 1150 W.

Immature VLPs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) are morphologically distinct when viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To better understand the nature of the Gag-Gag interactions leading to these distinctions, we constructed vectors encoding several RSV/HIV-1 chimeric Gag proteins for expression in either insect cells or vertebrate cells. We used TEM, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and a novel correlative scanning EM (SEM)-confocal microscopy technique to study the assembly properties of these proteins. Most chimeric proteins assembled into regular VLPs, with the capsid (CA) domain being the primary determinant of overall particle diameter and morphology. The presence of domains between matrix and CA also influenced particle morphology by increasing the spacing between the inner electron-dense ring and the VLP membrane. Fluorescently tagged versions of wild-type RSV, HIV-1, or murine leukemia virus Gag did not colocalize in cells. However, wild-type Gag proteins colocalized extensively with chimeric Gag proteins bearing the same CA domain, implying that Gag interactions are mediated by CA. A dramatic example of this phenomenon was provided by a nuclear export-deficient chimera of RSV Gag carrying the HIV-1 CA domain, which by itself localized to the nucleus but relocalized to the cytoplasm in the presence of wild type HIV-1 Gag. Wild-type and chimeric Gag proteins were capable of coassembly into a single VLP as viewed by correlative fluorescence SEM if, and only if, the CA domain was derived from the same virus. These results imply that the primary selectivity of Gag-Gag interactions is determined by the CA domain.","['Ako-Adjei, Danso', 'Johnson, Marc C', 'Vogt, Volker M']","['Ako-Adjei D', 'Johnson MC', 'Vogt VM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Capsid/*chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",2005/10/18 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/21/13463 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.21.13463-13472.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Nov;79(21):13463-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.21.13463-13472.2005.,,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",PMC1262573,,,,,"['R01 CA020081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, human and mouse embryonic stem cells express Kit transcripts. Stem cell factor exists as both a soluble and a membrane-bound glycoprotein while Kit is a glycoprotein receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. The complete absence of stem cell factor or Kit is lethal. Gain-of-function mutations of Kit are associated with several human neoplasms including acute myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mastocytomas, and nasal T-cell lymphomas. Binding of stem cell factor to Kit results in receptor dimerization and activation of protein kinase activity. The activated receptor becomes autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for signal transduction molecules containing SH2 domains. Kit activates Akt, Src family kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cgamma, and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases. Kit exists in active and inactive conformations as determined by X-ray crystallography. Kit consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, a juxtamembrane domain, and a protein kinase domain that contains an insert of about 80 amino acid residues. The juxtamembrane domain inhibits enzyme activity in cis by maintaining the control alphaC-helix and the activation loop in their inactive conformations. The juxtamembrane domain also inhibits receptor dimerization. STI-571, a clinically effective targeted protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, binds to an inactive conformation of Kit. The majority of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors have Kit gain-of-function mutations in the juxtamembrane domain, and most people with these tumors respond to STI-571. STI-571 binds to Kit and Bcr-Abl (the oncoprotein of chronic myelogenous leukemia) at their ATP-binding sites.","['Roskoski, Robert Jr']",['Roskoski R Jr'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 1100 Florida Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119, USA. biocrr@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/10/18 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)02179-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.150 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Dec 23;338(3):1307-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.150.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) and PK11195 are modulators of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) which has been proposed to play a critical role in regulating survival and death. Using SEM and RS4;11 lines with the t(4;11) translocation, the B-ALL line REH, and the T-ALL line Jurkat, we show that pre-treatment with CsA or PK11195 significantly enhances resveratrol-mediated apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in these cells, as measured by annexin V and JC-1 staining, respectively. No significant multi-drug resistance efflux of the fluorescent substrate calcein was observed in these ALL lines, indicating that CsA and PK11195 were acting at the level of the mitochondria to enhance loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of apoptosis.

METHODS: We report six children with ALL, who presented with splenomegaly after a median (range) treatment duration of 12 (6-22) months. All these children were treated in the 6TG-arm. RESULTS: The median (range) age at presentation was 6.6 (3.2-11.5) years. There were five boys. The presenting features were splenomegaly in all and hepatomegaly in four. AST was abnormal in one (80 IU/l, normal range 10-50). Abdominal sonography showed an altered texture of the liver parenchyma and confirmed splenomegaly.

In mice, BAFF-R is required for B-cell maturation and survival, and in mice and humans, the overproduction of BAFF is associated with autoimmune disease. We sought to determine the normal pattern of BAFF-R expression at specific stages of B- and T-cell development and whether this pattern of expression corresponds with related B- and T-cell neoplasms. Most circulating human B cells and a small subset of T cells are BAFF-R-positive. In reactive lymphoid tissues, BAFF-R is expressed by B cells colonizing the mantle zones, by a subset of cells within germinal centers, and rare cells in the interfollicular T-cell zone. BAFF-R is also expressed by B cells colonizing the splenic marginal zone. Seventy-seven (78%) of 116 cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders were BAFF-R-positive by immunohistochemical and/or flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis, including most cases of mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In contrast, cases of precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma exhibit weak to negative staining for BAFF-R. All cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas were BAFF-R-negative, including all cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified. These findings highlight BAFF-R as a marker of both normal and neoplastic B cells and raise the possibility that BAFF-R expression is necessary for the survival of a subset of neoplastic B lymphocytes analogous to its known role in promoting normal B-cell maturation and survival.","['Rodig, Scott J', 'Shahsafaei, Ali', 'Li, Betty', 'Mackay, Charles R', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Rodig SJ', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Li B', 'Mackay CR', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/10/18 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(05)00403-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2005.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2005 Oct;36(10):1113-9. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2005.08.005.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have compared the potency of gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors expressing the P140K mutant of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). MGMT-P140K is a clinically relevant selection marker that mediates a strong survival advantage in hematopoietic cells exposed to alkylating agents. We designed gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors that contained identical enhancer-promoter sequences located either in the LTR or downstream of the packaging region, for internal initiation of transcription from SIN backbones. Gammaretroviral vectors with intact LTRs containing enhancer-promoter sequences showed both higher titers and higher expression levels than the lentiviral counterparts, likely a result of suboptimal RNA processing of the lentiviral leader region. In the SIN context, gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors with comparable internal cassettes had similar expression properties. Interestingly, gammaretroviral SIN vectors pseudotyped with RD114/TR had a higher transduction efficiency on proliferating human CD34(+) cells than lentiviral counterparts. These results encourage further investigations into the formation of retroviral hybrid vectors that combine the desired properties of high efficiency and increased biosafety.","['Schambach, Axel', 'Bohne, Jens', 'Chandra, Saurabh', 'Will, Elke', 'Margison, Geoffrey P', 'Williams, David A', 'Baum, Christopher']","['Schambach A', 'Bohne J', 'Chandra S', 'Will E', 'Margison GP', 'Williams DA', 'Baum C']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostaseology, and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/virology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/*biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2005/10/18 09:00,2009/01/24 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(05)01566-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2006 Feb;13(2):391-400. doi: 10.1016/j.ymthe.2005.08.012.

'Emperor Banana') is a banana cultivar that has not been studied previously. In this study, a glucose/mannose-specific lectin has been purified from the emperor banana by affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S and gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 75. This lectin was composed of two identical 15-kDa subunits with N-terminal amino acid sequence similarity to other lectins from other Musa species. Emperor banana lectin stimulated [3H-methyl]-thymidine uptake by mouse splenocytes and nitric oxide production by mouse macrophages. In contrast to Con A, the mitogenic activity of emperor banana lectin toward mouse splenocytes but not its stimulatory effect on nitric oxide production by mouse macrophages could be abrogated by 200 mM glucose. Emperor banana lectin also inhibited proliferation of leukemia cell (L1210) and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.

New techniques for the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections are emerging. Pharmacologic options for treating invasive fungal infections have also improved during the past few years, with new drugs becoming available that have broader antifungal spectra and better safety profiles. Other novel treatment approaches, such as combination therapy, are also being explored. Early investigations have produced encouraging results; however, large, prospective studies involving many patients are necessary to validate the widespread use of these approaches.

This important development will now end the ongoing debate as to which of these was the preferred classification. The new classification will facilitate more uniformity in diagnosis, management and treatment of cutaneous lymphomas. In particular, it provides a useful distinction between indolent and more aggressive types of primary cutaneous lymphoma and provides practical advice on preferred management and treatment regimens. This will thereby prevent patients receiving high-grade treatment for low-grade biological disease. This review focuses on those diseases which have found new consensus agreement compared with the original WHO and EORTC classifications. In cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, these include folliculotropic mycosis fungoides, defining features of Sezary syndrome, primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, lymphomatoid papulosis and borderline lesions) and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma are allocated provisional entry status and thereby afford better definitions for some cases of currently unspecified primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, diseases which have found new consensus agreement include primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous follicular centre lymphoma, primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, other. CD4+/CD56+ haematodermic neoplasm (early plasmacytoid dendritic cell leukaemia/lymphoma) now appears as a precursor haematological neoplasm and replaces the previous terminology of blastic NK-cell lymphoma. Other haematopoietic and lymphoid tumours involving the skin, as part of systemic disease, will appear in the forthcoming WHO publication Tumours of the Skin. The new classification raises interesting new problems and questions about primary cutaneous lymphoma and some of these are discussed in this article. It is, however, a splendid signpost indicating the direction in which research in cutaneous lymphoma needs to go. In the interim, we have an international consensus classification which is clinically meaningful.","['Slater, D N']",['Slater DN'],"['Department of Histopathology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield S10 2JF, UK. david.slater@sth.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,IM,"['Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lymphoma/*classification', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification', 'Mycosis Fungoides/classification', 'Sezary Syndrome/classification', 'Skin Neoplasms/*classification', 'World Health Organization']",2005/10/18 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/10/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJD6905 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06905.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2005 Nov;153(5):874-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06905.x.,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that the G-CSF and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) chimeric cytokine, progenipoietin-1, markedly expands the splenic and hepatic NKT cell population and enhances functional responses to alpha-galactosylceramide. In a murine model of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, donor NKT cells promoted host DC activation and enhanced perforin-restricted CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity against host-type antigens. Following leukemic challenge, donor treatment with progenipoietin-1 significantly improved overall survival when compared with G-CSF or control, attributable to reduced graft-versus-host disease mortality and paradoxical augmentation of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. Enhanced cellular cytotoxicity was dependent on donor NKT cells, and leukemia clearance was profoundly impaired in recipients of NKT cell-deficient grafts. Enhanced cytotoxicity and GVL effects were not associated with Flt-3L signaling or effects on DCs but were reproduced by prolonged G-CSF receptor engagement with pegylated G-CSF. Thus, modified G-CSF signaling during stem cell mobilization augments NKT cell-dependent CD8+ cytotoxicity, effectively separating graft-versus-host disease and GVL and greatly expanding the potential applicability of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the therapy of malignant disease.","['Morris, Edward S', 'MacDonald, Kelli P A', 'Rowe, Vanessa', 'Banovic, Tatjana', 'Kuns, Rachel D', 'Don, Alistair L J', 'Bofinger, Helen M', 'Burman, Angela C', 'Olver, Stuart D', 'Kienzle, Norbert', 'Porcelli, Steven A', 'Pellicci, Daniel G', 'Godfrey, Dale I', 'Smyth, Mark J', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Morris ES', 'MacDonald KP', 'Rowe V', 'Banovic T', 'Kuns RD', 'Don AL', 'Bofinger HM', 'Burman AC', 'Olver SD', 'Kienzle N', 'Porcelli SA', 'Pellicci DG', 'Godfrey DI', 'Smyth MJ', 'Hill GR']","['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Galactosylceramides/physiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI25249 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2005 Nov;115(11):3093-103. doi: 10.1172/JCI25249.

Here, we briefly review the normal biological function of TRAIL, the mechanism of cytotoxicity of TRAIL receptor ligands, and their effects on normal myeloid progenitors, myelodysplastic marrow and leukemic cells, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in vitro. Recent observations suggesting that DR4 is the predominant receptor for the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL in CLL and that histone deacetylase inhibitors synergize with TRAIL in CLL in vitro are described and discussed. Collectively, the reviewed studies not only illustrate the potential therapeutic usefulness of TRAIL and the agonistic antibodies, but also highlight the need for additional preclinical evaluation of these agents.","['Kaufmann, S H', 'Steensma, D P']","['Kaufmann SH', 'Steensma DP']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology/therapeutic use']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403946 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403946 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2195-202. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403946.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,121,,,,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early diagnosis and monitoring of these mutations may be important in order to prevent rapid expansion of resistant clones. We describe a quantitative mutation-specific PCR assay based on the readily available Taqman platform. Selectivity for the mutated target is conferred by mutation-specific primers destabilised by additional mismatches. The assay can be carried out in parallel to standard BCR-ABL quantification and is therefore more quickly compared to standard sequencing procedures. The sensitivity of the assay reaches 0.1%. It also allows for quantitative assessment of mutated clones. By analysing sequential samples of resistant subjects, we show how mutated clones were selected, maintained or deselected depending on the individual treatment setting. The high sensitivity and practical merits of this method makes it a good candidate for prospective molecular surveillance of patients at high risk for imatinib resistance.","['Gruber, F X E', 'Lamark, T', 'Anonli, A', 'Sovershaev, M A', 'Olsen, M', 'Gedde-Dahl, T', 'Hjort-Hansen, H', 'Skogen, B']","['Gruber FX', 'Lamark T', 'Anonli A', 'Sovershaev MA', 'Olsen M', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Hjort-Hansen H', 'Skogen B']","['Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital of Northern Norway, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway. franz.gruber@unn.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods/standards', 'DNA Primers', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403983 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403983 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2159-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403983.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They participate in the immune response against residual acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with partial HLA class I disparity. However, the role of NK cells in autologous leukemia-specific immunity remains poorly understood. We studied the function of NK cells in AML patients at diagnosis. Following isolation, CD56+CD3- cells exhibited a high proliferative potential in vitro in response to interleukin (IL)-2. The polyclonal population of activated AML-NK cells expressed normal levels of the activating receptor NKG2D and the major natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. AML-NK cells were highly effective with respect to interferon-gamma production, cytotoxicity against HLA class I-deficient K562 erythroleukemia cells in vitro and retardation of tumor growth in vivo in K562-bearing NOD/SCID mice. Importantly, when AML blasts were injected into NOD/SCID mice, a single dose of adoptively transferred autologous AML-NK cells significantly reduced the AML load by 8-77%. Recognition of AML blasts may be related to the observed upregulation of ligands for NKG2D and natural cytotoxicity receptors in vivo. We conclude that AML patient-derived NK cells are fully functional, in support of exploring the benefit of AML immunotherapy with IL-2-stimulated autologous NK cells.","['Siegler, U', 'Kalberer, C P', 'Nowbakht, P', 'Sendelov, S', 'Meyer-Monard, S', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz, A']","['Siegler U', 'Kalberer CP', 'Nowbakht P', 'Sendelov S', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz A']","['Department of Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*therapy', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403985 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403985 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2215-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403985.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSI potentiated the toxicity of a number of chemotherapeutic agents in myeloid leukemia but not in MM cell lines, while in combination with therapeutic proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (Bortezomib) it had a synergistic effect. PSI suppressed the growth of AML cell lines more effectively than PS-341. CFU-GM colony assays revealed that CD34+ bone marrow progenitors from CML and AML patients were more sensitive to PSI than those from normal subjects (IC50: 5, 15 and 50 nM for AML, CML and normal, respectively). Moreover, the growth of normal primitive progenitors (LTC-IC) was unaffected by 15 nM PSI (P=0.576). PSI-induced cell death required RNA transcription and protein synthesis, but not DNA replication, was accompanied by the upregulation of Bcl-2 and modest reduction of Bax and Bcl-XL proteins, and involved the activation of caspases 2, 3, 7 and 8.

However, the lack of randomized clinical trials makes it so difficult to determine which patients are best suited for this compared with other treatment regimens. Results for 128 patients given gemtuzumab ozogamicin in phase II trials were compared with those for 128 patients given high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) combination therapy in different trials Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze age, duration of first complete remission (CR1), and cytogenetics for potential differences between the groups. rare of overall remission )combined complete remission [CR] plus CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) following treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin or HDAC therapy were 38% and 41%, respectively. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment was associated with a higher overall remission rate compared with HDAC treatment if CR1 duration was 3-10.5 months. In contrast, HDAC treatment was associated with a higher overall remission rate than gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment if CR1 duration was >19 months. If CR1 duration was between 10.5 and 19 months, the differences in treatment responses were not statistically significant.

Early death (occurring within the first 6 weeks of therapy) was less likely in patients <45 years of age after ADAC and was less likely in patients >75 years of age after gemtuzumab ozogamicin treatment.

This review focuses on the most recent advances in the diagnostic and prognostic examination of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with particular emphasis on their implications in clinical management, taking into account the broadening of the therapeutic possibilities available today. RECENT FINDINGS: Through the biologic improvements achieved during the past few years it is now possible to effectively stratify chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients prognostically at presentation on the basis of several laboratory parameters. Furthermore, the availability of purine analogs and monoclonal antibodies and the extension of autografting and allografting procedures have allowed the achievement of higher response rates, including molecular remissions. With the aim of investigating whether early and aggressive treatment intervention may improve the survival of patients with a poor prognosis, new therapeutic trials have been specifically designed. SUMMARY: A complete biologic and clinical examination now allows the establishment of a correct diagnostic characterization of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to identify patients with early disease with a different prognostic likelihood. Multicenter prospective trials, in which the enrolled patients are stratified and treated according to their prognostic risk, will determine the best treatment for the different categories of patients. It is likely that in the near future each chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient can be offered a targeted treatment algorithm based on the clinical and biologic characteristics at presentation.","['Gentile, Massimo', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Gentile M', 'Mauro FR', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001622-200511000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cco.0000181403.75460.c7 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2005 Nov;17(6):597-604. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000181403.75460.c7.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Cy-g induced apoptosis in all three cell systems, and this indicated that Cy-g was not selective towards leukemia cells. Moreover, Cy-g caused HL-60 differentiation. The induction of apoptosis and cytodifferentiation involved different proteins, thus suggesting that Cy-g-induced apoptosis and cytodifferentiation are two distinct events.

In contrast, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells do not express MDR1 and are highly sensitive to anthracyclines. The combination of ATRA and the novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) depsipeptide (FK228) induced P-gp expression and prevented growth inhibition and apoptosis in NB4 APL cells subsequently exposed to doxorubicin (DOX). ATRA/FK228 treatment after exposure to DOX, however, enhanced apoptosis. Both agents, ATRA or FK228, induced MDR1 mRNA. This effect was significantly enhanced by ATRA/FK228 administered in combination, due in part to increased H4 and H3-Lys9 acetylation of the MDR1 promoter and recruitment of the nuclear transcription factor Y alpha (NFYA) transcription activator to the CCAAT box. Cotreatment with specific P-gp inhibitor PSC833 reversed cytoprotective effects of ATRA/FK228. G1 cell-cycle arrest and p21 mRNA induction were also observed in response to ATRA/FK228, which may restrict DOX-induced apoptosis of cells in G2 phase. These results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms involving NF-YA transcription factor recruitment and histone acetylation are activated by ATRA and HDACI, induce MDR1 in APL cells, and point to the critical importance of mechanism-based sequential therapy in future clinical trials that combine HDAC inhibitors, ATRA, and anthracyclines.","['Tabe, Yoko', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Contractor, Rooha', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Jin, Linhua', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii, Yuko', 'Nagaoka, Isao', 'Igari, Jun', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Tabe Y', 'Konopleva M', 'Contractor R', 'Munsell M', 'Schober WD', 'Jin L', 'Tsutsumi-Ishii Y', 'Nagaoka I', 'Igari J', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Unit 448, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, MDR', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)66409-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-4126 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 15;107(4):1546-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-4126.

The P39 MDS/AML cell line manifested constitutive NF-kappaB activation. In this cell line, NF-kappaB inhibition by small interfering RNAs specific for p65 or chemical inhibitors including bortezomib resulted in the down-regulation of apoptosis-inhibitory NF-kappaB target genes and subsequent cell death accompanied by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential as well as by the mitochondrial release of the caspase activator cytochrome c and the caspase-independent death effectors endonuclease G and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bone marrow cells from high-risk MDS patients also exhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activation similar to bone marrow samples from MDS/AML patients. Purified hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) and immature myeloid cells (CD33+) from high-risk MDS patients demonstrated the nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit. The frequency of cells with nuclear p65 correlated with blast counts, apoptosis suppression, and disease progression. NF-kappaB activation was confined to those cells that carried MDS-associated cytogenetic alterations. Since NF-kappaB inhibition induced rapid apoptosis of bone marrow cells from high-risk MDS patients, we postulate that NF-kappaB activation is responsible for the progressive suppression of apoptosis affecting differentiating MDS cells and thus contributes to malignant transformation.

We studied whether the expression level of PHGPx fluctuates in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) which were exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines at an inflammation site. Human peripheral PMNs up-regulated the expression level of PHGPx following culture with TNF-alpha, but not with IL-1beta, IL-8, and GRO. The up-regulated PHGPx expression was also observed in neutrophil-like cells that differentiated from the human leukemia cell line HL60 only after stimulation with TNF-alpha. However, macrophage-like differentiated HL60 cells and other cell lines, A498, ECV304, HeLa, U937, and HEK293, showed no increase in the PHGPx expression. This up-regulation of PHGPx was inhibited by treatment with the anti-oxidants, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and by inhibitors of NFkappaB and Src kinases. The stimulation of neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells with TNF-alpha induced activation of NFkappaB and c-Src kinase, and the activation was attenuated by treatment with the anti-oxidants. Up-regulation in neutrophil-like HL60 cells was also observed following exposure to H(2)O(2). These results indicate that activation of NFkappaB and/or Src kinases through ROS signaling may be involved in the up-regulation of the PHGPx in human PMNs stimulated by TNF-alpha.","['Hattori, Hiroyuki', 'Imai, Hirotaka', 'Furuhama, Kazuhisa', 'Sato, Osamu', 'Nakagawa, Yasuhito']","['Hattori H', 'Imai H', 'Furuhama K', 'Sato O', 'Nakagawa Y']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL1', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/10/15 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)02105-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.076 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Nov 18;337(2):464-73. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.076.

Richter's syndrome denotes the transformation of CLL into aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Most Richter's syndrome cases are secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, but some are Hodgkin's disease variants. Hodgkin's lymphoma is thought to originate from germinal center or post-germinal center B-cells with evidence of somatic V(H) hypermutation. Taking into account CLL and Hodgkin's lymphoma histogenesis, hypothetically only CLL derived from V(H) mutated B-cells can clonally progress to Hodgkin's lymphoma variant of Richter's syndrome. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the CLL ZAP-70 status as a surrogate for the V(H) mutational status in four patients with subsequent Hodgkin's disease variants of Richter's syndrome. In all three cases with proven or suspected clonal relationship between Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg- and leukemia cells, the CLL samples remained negative for ZAP-70, corresponding to CLL histogenesis from V(H) mutated B-cells. These empirical data suggest that the histological and clinical diversity of Richter's transformation could be to a part explained by the different origin of CLL, with Hodgkin's disease variants arising probably only in V(H) mutated CLL.","['Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Fong, Dominic']","['Tzankov A', 'Fong D']","['Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Mullerstrasse 44, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. alexandar.tzankov@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Mutation', 'Syndrome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(05)00465-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2006;66(3):577-9. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.007.

Clearly, expression during organogenesis is important for tissue-specific development. However, progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptors (ERalpha, ERbeta) are expressed during early development through the blastocyst stage in mice and other species, and yet are not essential for embryonic viability. We have utilized the mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell model to investigate the regulated expression of these receptors during differentiation. Surprisingly, one of the earliest changes in gene expression in response to a differentiation signal observed is PR gene induction. It parallels the time course of expression for the patterning genes Hoxb1 and Hoxa5. Unexpectedly, PR gene expression is not regulated in an estrogen-dependent manner by endogenous ERs or by transiently overexpressed ERalpha. Our results suggest a potentially novel mechanism of PR gene regulation within mES cells compared to adult tissues and the possibility of unique targets of PR action during early mES cell differentiation.","['Sauter, Carley N', 'McDermid, Rebecca L', 'Weinberg, Amy L', 'Greco, Tamara L', 'Xu, Xiaojie', 'Murdoch, Fern E', 'Fritsch, Michael K']","['Sauter CN', 'McDermid RL', 'Weinberg AL', 'Greco TL', 'Xu X', 'Murdoch FE', 'Fritsch MK']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1300 University Ave., MSC 5250, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/deficiency', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Progesterone/analysis/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2005/10/15 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/10/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(05)00426-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2005 Dec 10;311(2):251-64. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.09.005.

Although anti-infectives are thought to be relatively safe, they can place a burden on patients and be inconsistent to particular care plans. The current complex, and at times fragmented, medical care often fails to address these issues in decision-making. In many ways, the ethics governing the end of life decisions related to dialysis, hydration/nutrition, and hypercalcemia parallel those of anti-infectives.

The reciprocal modulating effects of FGF2 and TGFbeta1 on each other's receptors make the GM-490 cell line a new model for investigating the relationship between these growth factors and their receptors in autocrine loops which are believed to sustain the malignant clone in hematological diseases.","['Bodo, Maria', 'Baroni, Tiziano', 'Bellucci, Catia', 'Lilli, Cinzia', 'De Ioanni, Maria', 'Bonifacio, Elisabetta', 'Moretti, Lorenzo', 'Becchetti, Ennio', 'Bellocchio, Silvia', 'Delfini, Costante', 'Lumare, Eleonora', 'Tabilio, Antonio']","['Bodo M', 'Baroni T', 'Bellucci C', 'Lilli C', 'De Ioanni M', 'Bonifacio E', 'Moretti L', 'Becchetti E', 'Bellocchio S', 'Delfini C', 'Lumare E', 'Tabilio A']","['Histology Section, Faculty of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. bodo@unipg.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Collagen/biosynthesis', 'Collagenases/metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/biosynthesis', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Osteocalcin/metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2005/10/14 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/10/14 09:00'],"['2005/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20517 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2006 Mar;206(3):682-92. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20517.,,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-TEFb activity is crucial for efficient transcription elongation of viral and cellular genes. HEXIM1 was originally isolated as a protein up-regulated by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), a prototypical inducer of differentiation. To determine the causative role of HEXIM1 during cell differentiation we analyzed the biochemical and functional consequences of HEXIM1 protein levels in several in vitro differentiation systems. We found that HEXIM1 mRNA and protein levels are up-regulated during differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells upon treatment with HMBA or DMSO. Stimulation of HEXIM1 is not restricted to hematopoietic cells, as induction of phenotypic differentiation of neuroblastoma cells by retinoic acid results in up-regulation of HEXIM1. Moreover, ectopic expression of HEXIM1 causes growth inhibition and promotes neuronal differentiation. These findings highlight a crucial role of HEXIM1 protein during cell differentiation.","['Turano, Mimmo', 'Napolitano, Giuliana', 'Dulac, Cyprien', 'Majello, Barbara', 'Bensaude, Olivier', 'Lania, Luigi']","['Turano M', 'Napolitano G', 'Dulac C', 'Majello B', 'Bensaude O', 'Lania L']","['Department of Structural and Functional Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/10/14 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2005/10/14 09:00'],"['2005/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20502 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2006 Mar;206(3):603-10. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20502.,,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (HEXIM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds synthesized were studied against leukemias P388 and L1210 after the subsequent estimation of their toxicity in vivo, and for their ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and to inhibit cell proliferation in normal human lymphocytes in vitro. The in vitro results correlated well, on a molar basis, with the results obtained from the study of the anti-leukemic potency. In a comparative study, the B-lactamic steroidal derivatives proved less active than the 7-oxidized ones against both leukemias. The presence of the -NHCO- group in the B-steroidal ring did not have the same positive effect on the biological action of chlorambucil's active metabolite esters as in the D-lactamic ring. However, this new modification of the B-ring rendered the final esteric derivatives much more toxic, compared with to the corresponding esters with a simple B-ring. This loss of the anti-leukemic specificity, which occurs from the modification of the B-ring, is additional evidence for the role of the steroidal part on the mechanism of action of these promising compounds.

After several days' culture in murine stromal OP9-conditioned medium supplemented with a cytokine cocktail on collagen-coated dishes, ES cells differentiated into a very unique population of cells with a finger-like appearance. These finger-like cells were positive for mesodermal and/or hemangioblastic markers of kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1), and produced large amounts of protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C-positive hematopoietic cells. These hematopoietic cells showed the morphology of immature hematopoietic cells, formed blast cell colonies with high efficiency, and were positive for CD34 antigen, KDR, TAL1, and GATA binding protein 1, suggesting that these blast cells are equivalent to the multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, they produced functional macrophages in murine stromal MS-5-conditioned medium and primitive erythroblasts in the presence of erythropoietin. The finger-like cells, putative mesodermal progenitors and/or hemangioblasts, actively proliferated and repetitively produced hematopoietic cells as long as they were maintained on the original dish. By contrast, the majority of the finger-like cells differentiated into endothelial cells with specific markers and specific functions after transfer to fresh dishes, indicating that conditions established in the original dish supported the proliferation and hematopoietic differentiation of the finger-like cells.

However, the prognosis has improved over past decades, and survival rates of 60% and above have been reported. Still, this implies that more than a third of children and adolescents die from this disease. Moreover, treatment is intensive, and quality of life and late effects are worrying issues. Therefore, there is a need for further improved treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. This review describes several important developments in this respect, such as improved diagnostics, prognostic factors, subgroup-directed and tailored treatment, and targeted therapy. In addition, background information is provided and current treatment strategies are described, as well as the late effects of treatment. Most groups now have risk-group adapted protocols, with allogeneic stem cell transplantation often being reserved for the higher risk group. Even in these cases, the benefit of stem cell transplantation has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt with current high-intensive chemotherapy. Similarly, the use of cranial irradiation for CNS prophylaxis and maintenance treatment does not seem to be indicated in general. Subgroup-directed treatment has become a reality for acute myeloid leukemia in young children with Down's syndrome and in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In addition to tailoring therapy according to biologic features and especially monitoring treatment by measurements of minimal residual disease, targeted therapy for subgroups with activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases will further optimize the treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Together with the development of many novel agents that have different mechanisms of action than the currently available anticancer agents, and improved supportive care, it is realistic that the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia in children and adolescents will improve further in the next 5-10 years.","['ter Bals, Edske', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['ter Bals E', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, NL-1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/10/14 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/10/14 09:00'],"['2005/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737140.5.5.917 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2005 Oct;5(5):917-29. doi: 10.1586/14737140.5.5.917.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used in a variety of malignant diseases since then, its use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has recently started to gain interest. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are generally elderly, and because of its relatively benign course, they were not considered suitable candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Nonetheless, there have been marked improvements in transplantation techniques, including better conditioning regimens that have decreased treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In this article, the authors review the most recent data on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as the change in risk stratification based on newer prognostic factors and its impact on treatment decisions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Santos, Edgardo S', 'Masri, Mohamad', 'Safah, Hana']","['Santos ES', 'Masri M', 'Safah H']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans VA Medical Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. edgardo_ny@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Decision Making', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Morbidity', 'Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",2005/10/14 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2005/10/14 09:00'],"['2005/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737140.5.5.875 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2005 Oct;5(5):875-91. doi: 10.1586/14737140.5.5.875.,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with specific medical conditions are regularly treated at the Department of Prosthodontics, University of Bern, Switzerland. All those who had received implant-prosthodontic treatment during the past 12 years were reexamined for this study. Among these patients the following diseases were observed: cleft lip/palate (n = 8), Down syndrome (n = 3), Sjogren syndrome and scleroderma (n = 2), ectodermal dysplasia (n = 4), developmental retardation (n = 2), chronic leukemia (n = 2), lichen planus (n = 1), cerebral palsy (n = 1), deaf-muteness (n = 1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 1). At the time of the treatment the mean age was 55.6 years. ITI implants had been placed according to a standard protocol with local anesthesia, except for one patient in whom full anesthesia was used. One hundred three implants were loaded and supported a total of 34 fixed or removable prostheses. All patients were appointed to a regular maintenance care program. In the context of the present study, all but 1 patient were reexamined clinically. New radiographs were obtained, and the implants and prostheses assessed. Additional information was obtained from regular records in the patients' charts. RESULTS: Three implants were lost in the healing phase, and 1 implant was replaced. Only 1 patient with 4 implants was lost from the study (she had passed away). The survival rate of the loaded implants was 100%. In 1 patient, peri-implant bony defects were detected around all 3 intraforaminal implants. The prosthetic plan was maintained in all patients, and they continued to wear the originally planned type of prosthesis. Complications included insufficient hygiene, soft tissue hyperplasia, extraction of remaining teeth, and minor maintenance or repair of the prostheses. CONCLUSIONS: So far, the mostly unknown implications and possible risks for the process of osseointegration and long-term maintenance in patients with such rare diseases and defects has resulted in a rather restricted application of implants. However, from the present results, it appears that implants can successfully be placed and maintained. This is ascribed in part to a strict maintenance care program provided by the caregivers and to a high compliance of the patients who participated in this program to perform good oral hygiene.","['Oczakir, Ceyda', 'Balmer, Sacha', 'Mericske-Stern, Regina']","['Oczakir C', 'Balmer S', 'Mericske-Stern R']","['Department of Prosthodontics, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Prosthodont,The International journal of prosthodontics,8900938,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Dental Care for Chronically Ill', 'Dental Implantation, Endosseous', '*Dental Implants', 'Dental Prophylaxis', '*Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/10/14 09:00,2005/11/01 09:00,['2005/10/14 09:00'],"['2005/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Prosthodont. 2005 Sep-Oct;18(5):383-9.,,['0 (Dental Implants)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since WT1 encodes MHC class I-restricted peptides recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), WT1 has been considered as a promising tumor-associated antigen (TAA) for developing anticancer immunotherapy. In order to carry out an effective peptide-based cancer immunotherapy, MHC class II-restricted epitope peptides that elicit anti-tumor CD4(+) helper T lymphocytes (HTL) will be needed. In this study, we analyzed HTL responses against WT1 antigen using HTL lines elicited by in vitro immunization of human lymphocytes with synthetic peptides predicted to serve as HTL epitopes derived from the sequence of WT1. Two peptides, WT1(124-138) and WT1(247-261), were shown to induce peptide-specific HTL, which were restricted by frequently expressed HLA class II alleles. Here, we also demonstrate that both peptides-reactive HTL lines were capable of recognizing naturally processed antigens presented by dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysates or directly by WT1+ tumor cells that express MHC class II molecules. Interestingly, the two WT1 HTL epitopes described here are closely situated to known MHC class I-restricted CTL epitopes, raising the possibility of stimulating CTL and HTL responses using a relatively small synthetic peptide vaccine. Because HTL responses to TAA are known to be important for promoting long-lasting anti-tumor CTL responses, the newly described WT1 T-helper epitopes could provide a useful tool for designing powerful vaccines against WT1-expressing tumors.","['Kobayashi, Hiroya', 'Nagato, Toshihiro', 'Aoki, Naoko', 'Sato, Keisuke', 'Kimura, Shoji', 'Tateno, Masatoshi', 'Celis, Esteban']","['Kobayashi H', 'Nagato T', 'Aoki N', 'Sato K', 'Kimura S', 'Tateno M', 'Celis E']","['Department of Pathology, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, 078-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Drug Design', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DRB4 Chains', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*immunology']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-005-0071-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Jul;55(7):850-60. doi: 10.1007/s00262-005-0071-0.

It showed good appetite and weight gain but had intermittent watery, yellow diarrhoea. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Clinical examination under sedation was unremarkable and routine blood tests showed no significant abnormalities. The cat was negative for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). Different canned cat foods did not alter the course of the diarrhoea, and the cat was euthanised 6 months after capture. At necropsy, two sections of adult Spirometra tapeworms were found in the jejunum and typical Spirometra eggs were found in colonic contents. Molecular identification of the parasite was undertaken, using the cytochrome-c oxidase subunit-1 gene (cox1) sequence. DIAGNOSIS: Chronic intermittent diarrhoea associated with Spirometra erinacei / S. erinaceieuropaei infection. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Spirometra has not been reported in New Zealand before but has been associated with gastrointestinal disease in cats in other parts of the world. It requires species targeted treatment to be eliminated effectively, and is zoonotic.

Coadministration of flavopiridol with HDAC inhibitors synergistically potentiated mitochondrial damage (cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low pI, and apoptosis-inducing factor release), caspase activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, and cell death in both wild type and Bcl-2- or Bcl-x(L)-overexpressing cells and induced a pronounced loss of clonogenicity. In contrast, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) largely blocked these events in cells exposed to the cytotoxic agent 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). Enforced expression of dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain failed to protect cells from the flavopiridol/histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) regimen, arguing against the involvement of the receptor pathway in lethality. Ectopic expression of a phosphorylation loop-deleted Bcl-2 or Bcl-2 lacking the serine(70) phosphorylation site, which dramatically protected cells from ara-C lethality, delayed but did not prevent flavopiridol/HDAC inhibitor-induced mitochondrial injury, cell death, or loss of clonogenicity. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) was also unable to prevent the flavopiridol/HDACI regimen from inducing a conformational change in and mitochondrial translocation of Bax, and it did not attenuate Bax dimerization. As a whole, these findings indicate that in contrast to certain conventional cytotoxic agents such as ara-C, overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) are largely ineffective in preventing perturbations in Bax, mitochondrial injury, and cell death in human leukemia cells subjected to simultaneous CDK and HDAC inhibition. They also raise the possibility that a strategy combining CDK and HDAC inhibitors may be effective against drug-resistant leukemia cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L).","['Dasmahapatra, Girija', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dasmahapatra G', 'Almenara JA', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.105.016154 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.105.016154 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Jan;69(1):288-98. doi: 10.1124/mol.105.016154.

The purpose of this study was to use objective quantitative MR imaging to prospectively assess the temporal evolution of LE extent and intensity. METHODS: Forty-five children (low-risk, 10 mol/L/12F; mean age, 5.0 years at diagnosis; standard/high-risk, 11 mol/L/12F; mean age, 9.2 years at diagnosis) treated for ALL on a single institutional protocol were evaluated longitudinally to assess the extent of LE (proportion of white matter impacted) through tissue segmentation and the relative intensity of LE through relative elevations in T1 and T2 relaxation rates. One-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess differences in quantitative measures at 4 different points in therapy both within and between risk arms. RESULTS: The proportion of white matter affected in both patient groups increased significantly with additional courses of IV-MTX, whereas the intensity of LE also increased steadily; however, both the intensity and extent of LE declined significantly approximately 1.5 years after completion of IV-MTX. Increases in the T1 and T2 relaxation rates above normal-appearing white matter were significantly correlated with each other and were dependent on the proportion of white matter affected. CONCLUSION: Higher doses and more courses of IV-MTX were associated with increased intensity and extent of LE. There was a significant reduction in both the intensity and extent of LE after completion of therapy. The impact of these changes on neurocognitive functioning and quality of life in survivors remains to be determined.","['Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Glass, John O', 'Helton, Kathleen J', 'Langston, James W', 'Li, Chin-Shang', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Reddick WE', 'Glass JO', 'Helton KJ', 'Langston JW', 'Li CS', 'Pui CH']","[""Division of Translational Imaging Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

Here we report that an associated PML body/Cajal body can co-localize to an snRNA gene locus, with the Cajal body invariably situated between the PML body and the snRNA locus. Binding studies demonstrate that coilin (a Cajal body protein) directly interacts with PIASy (a PML body protein). Cell biological experiments using coilin and PIASy knockout cell lines demonstrate that interactions between coilin and PIASy account in part for the observed association of Cajal bodies with PML bodies. When the PIASy interaction region on coilin is deleted, the frequency of the association between Cajal bodies and PML bodies is reduced.

It plays important roles in cell growth, apoptosis and cell transformation, and is constitutively active in a variety of tumor cells. In this study, we provide evidence that zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) interacts physically with STAT3. ZIPK specifically interacted with STAT3, and did not bind to STAT1, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b or STAT6. ZIPK phosphorylated STAT3 on serine 727 (Ser727) and enhanced STAT3 transcriptional activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of ZIPK expression decreased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)- and IL-6-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. Furthermore, LIF- and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation stimulated ZIPK activity.

Adoptive transfer of donor-derived ex vivo-generated HA-1-specific oligoclonal T cells or HA-1 peptide patient vaccination are currently being explored as curative tools for stem cell based immunotherapy of hematologic malignancies. Another treatment modality to eradicate residual leukemic cells after SCT is the transfer of the HA-1 hematopoietic-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) into cells from the stem cell donor. This strategy would be particularly useful in case of relapse after cord blood transplantation (CBT) and is explored in this study. DESIGN AND METHODS: HLA-A2(neg) adult peripheral blood and cord blood mononuclear cells were transduced with the genes encoding the HA-1 alpha and beta TCR chains derived from established HA-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones. RESULTS: The T cells transduced with HA-1 TCR alpha beta showed consistent marker gene expression, but low staining with HLA-A2/HA-1 tetrameric complexes. They did, however, show hematopoietic-restricted cytolytic activity against HLA-A2(pos)/HA-1(pos) target cells, including leukemic cells. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The low level of HA-1-specific tetramer staining of HA-1 TCR alpha beta transduced T cells may be caused by hybrid TCR formation of the transferred TCRalpha and beta chains with endogenous TCR alpha and beta chains. This may cause unwanted alloreactivity and requires attention. The HA-1 TCR alpha beta transduced T cells show that the HA-1 TCR can be functionally transferred into donor mononuclear cells, which can be exploited in immunotherapeutic settings of SCT and CBT for hematologic malignancies.","['Mommaas, Bregje', 'van Halteren, Astrid G S', 'Pool, Jos', 'van der Veken, Lars', 'Wieles, Brigitte', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Goulmy, Els']","['Mommaas B', 'van Halteren AG', 'Pool J', 'van der Veken L', 'Wieles B', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Goulmy E']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/administration & dosage/*genetics/immunology', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*administration & dosage/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1415-21.,,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1303B.

We analyzed the effect of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on BM and EM relapses in 194 consecutive patients with acute leukemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation at a single institute. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared relapse-free survival (RFS), BM RFS, and EM RFS after allografting according to the occurrence of GVHD. We also investigated the clinical outcome of patients who relapsed after their allogeneic transplantation. RESULTS: Relapse occurred in 65 patients; in 41 (63%) relapse occurred in the BM only, in 9 (14%) it occurred in both BM and EM sites, and 15 (23%) in EM sites only. Patients who developed acute GVHD after transplantation had significantly higher relapse-free survival (69.2% vs. 52.4%; p=0.042) and BM RFS (80.7% vs. 59.1%; p=0.030) compared to those who did not. However, EM RFS was similar between patients with and without acute GVHD (76.7% vs. 78.2%; p=0.744). Among the 65 patients who relapsed, 32 patients attained complete remission with salvage treatments and 22 experienced a second relapse, which occurred in the BM (n=9), BM and EM sites (n=1), or EM sites (n=12).

Bendamustine was given at a starting dose of 100 mg/m2 on day 1 and 2, repeated every 3-4 weeks. RESULTS: Major toxicities were leukocytopenia (CTC grade 3+4) in 8/16 and infections (CTC grade 3+4) in 7/16 patients. Six patients had dose-limiting toxicity which led to dose de-escalation from 100 to 70 mg/m2 in three patients. The maximum tolerated dose was 70 mg/m2. According to NCI-WG criteria, 9/16 patients (56%) responded to therapy, seven to doses <or=80 mg/m2. Two patients achieved complete remission. Five patients had a partial response and two patients stable disease. The median duration of response was 42.7 months. After a follow-up period of 53.2 months, five patients (31%) were still in remission. The median overall survival time for all patients was 45.6 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the excellent efficacy of bendamustine in heavily pre-treated and treatment-refractory patients, even at reduced doses of 140 mg/m2 per course. In pre-treated CLL patients, impaired bone marrow function is likely to enhance the myelotoxic side effects of bendamustine. Based on these results, the recommended optimal therapeutic dose of bendamustine in refractory CLL is 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 every 4 weeks.","['Bergmann, Manuela A', 'Goebeler, Maria E', 'Herold, Michael', 'Emmerich, Bertold', 'Wilhelm, Martin', 'Ruelfs, Corinna', 'Boening, Lothar', 'Hallek, Michael J']","['Bergmann MA', 'Goebeler ME', 'Herold M', 'Emmerich B', 'Wilhelm M', 'Ruelfs C', 'Boening L', 'Hallek MJ']","['Medical Clinic III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1357-64.,,"['0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",,,,,['German CLL Study Group'],,['Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1300A.

Results of the PETHEMA ALL-93 trial.",1346-56,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The optimal post-remission therapy for adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not well established. This multicenter randomized trial by the Spanish PETHEMA Group was addressed to compare three options of post-remission therapy in adults with high-risk ALL: chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and autologous SCT. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 222 valid high-risk ALL patients entered the trial. All received a standard five-drug/five-week induction course. Patients in complete remission with an HLA-identical family donor were assigned to allogeneic SCT (n=84) and the remaining were randomized to autologous SCT (n=50) or to delayed intensification followed by maintenance chemotherapy up to 2 years in complete remission (n=48). RESULTS: Overall, 183 patients achieved complete remission (82%). With a median follow-up of 70 months, the median disease-free survival and overall survival were 17 and 23 months, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 35% (95% CI, 30%-41%) and 34% (95% CI, 28%-39%), respectively. Patients allocated to the chemotherapy, allogeneic and autologous SCT were comparable in the main pre-treatment ALL characteristics and the rate of response to therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no differences between patients according to whether they had or did not have a donor in disease-free survival (39%, 95% CI 30-48% vs. 33%, 95% CI 23-41%) and overall survival (44%, 95% CI 35-52% vs. 35%, 95% CI 25-44%), as well as for autologous SCT vs. chemotherapy comparisons (disease-free survival: 40%, 95% CI 28-52% vs. 51%, 95% CI 37-67%; overall survival: 43%, 95% CI 29-58% vs. 52%, 95% CI 39-65%). No differences were observed when the analysis was made on the basis of the treatment actually performed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to prove that, when a family donor is available, allogeneic SCT produces a better outcome than autologous SCT or chemotherapy in adults with high-risk ALL.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Bethencourt, Concepcion', 'Parody, Ricardo', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'del Potro, Eloy', 'Torm, Mar', 'Rivas, Concepcion', 'Besalduch, Joan', 'Sanz, Miguel-Angel', 'Ortega, Juan-Jose']","['Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Bethencourt C', 'Parody R', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Moreno MJ', 'del Potro E', 'Torm M', 'Rivas C', 'Besalduch J', 'Sanz MA', 'Ortega JJ']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, C/ Canyet S/N, 08916 Badalona, Spain. jmribera@ns.hugtip.scs.es""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1346-56.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,"['PETHEMA Group, Spain']",,['Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1299.

The only potential cure for such patients is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). As data on allogeneic SCT in this context are limited we did a retrospective study of allogeneic SCT in patients with AML or MDS who had chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 65 patients (16 children, 49 adults) with AML (n=33) or MDS (n=32) who had chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities and who underwent allogeneic SCT in six Dutch Centers between 1983 and 2001. Data on all these patients are recorded in the Netherlands Stem Cell Transplant Registry (Typhon). RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival rate among all patients was 25%. Patients below the age of 40 years had significantly fewer relapses (40%) and better survival (38%) than those above the age of 40 (86% and 8%, respectively). Relapses were less frequent in recipients of unrelated grafts than in those whose grafts were from HLA-identical siblings (30% versus 69%). The development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV was independently associated with significantly higher transplant-related mortality (TRM). Patients with either chromosome 5 or chromosome 7 abnormalities had a significantly better survival than patients with both chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities. These patients with poor-risk chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were compared with a group of patients with a secondary AML/MDS and normal cytogenetics and were found to have significantly more relapses and significantly worse survival but a similar TRM. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with AML or MDS with chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities do rather poorly after allogeneic SCT, mainly because of the very high relapse rate. Nevertheless, this is the only approach that can cure some of these patients.","['van der Straaten, Hanneke M', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Schattenberg, Anton V M B', 'Egeler, Roel M', 'Barge, Renee M', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Verdonck, Leo F']","['van der Straaten HM', 'van Biezen A', 'Brand R', 'Schattenberg AV', 'Egeler RM', 'Barge RM', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Schouten HC', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Verdonck LF']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1339-45.,,,,,,,"['Netherlands Stem Cell Transplant Registry ""TYPHON""']",,['Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1298C.

We have shown in phase I and II trials that a tumor-specific, bcr-abl-derived peptide vaccine can be safely administered to patients with chronic phase CML and can elicit a reliable specific CD4 immune response. However, variable CD8 responses and no HLA A0201-restricted responses were found. One strategy to circumvent this poor immunogenicity is to design synthetic immunogenic analog peptides that cross-react with the native peptides (a heteroclitic response). The aim of this study was to design such peptides. DESIGN AND METHODS: By using computer prediction analysis. We designed a number of synthetic peptides derived from the junctional sequences of CML (p210/b3a2 or p210/b2a2) in which single and double amino acid substitutions were introduced at key HLA A0201 binding positions. The binding of these peptides was tested by a thermostabilization assay using a T2 cell line. RESULTS: We found three peptides that predicted good binding to HLA A0201 molecules and stabilized MHC class I A0201 molecules on the surface of T2 cell lines. These peptides were screened for eliciting HLA restricted, peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses using CD3+ T cells from several A0201 donors and CML patients. The CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes lines were assessed by either interferon-g ELISPOT or a chromium release assay using pulsed, HLA-matched leukemic cell lines. The analog peptides generated larger immune responses (increased CD8 T-cell precursor frequency) than did the native peptides. Importantly, CD8+ T cells stimulated with the new synthetic peptides cross-reacted with the native bcr-abl peptides. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, analog CML fusion peptides with increased immunogenicity and heteroclitic properties can be synthesized and may be useful in vaccination strategies.","['Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Korontsvit, Tatyana', 'Zakhaleva, Victoriya', 'Roberts, Wendy', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Korontsvit T', 'Zakhaleva V', 'Roberts W', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*physiology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemical synthesis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1324-32.,,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,"['P01 23766/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 55349/PHS HHS/United States']",['Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1297B.

KQSSKALQR and GFKQSSKAL, peptide sequences spanning the b3a2 bcr-abl junction, have affinity for HLA-A3 and HLA-B8, respectively, and we have shown the presence of KQSSKALQR on the surface of CML cells. We analyzed the existence of bcr-abl-specific T cells in vivo and correlated their presence to contemporary disease burden. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes directed against the bcr-abl junction, using fluorochrome-labeled tetramers of HLA-A3 with KQSSKALQR and of HLA-B8 with GFKQSSKAL, and flow cytometry analysis. Using chromium-release assays and interferon-g ELISPOT assays, we also studied the functionality of these expanded T cells. RESULTS: Eight of 12 b3a2+ HLA-A3+ and/or HLA-B8+ CML patients studied serially on at least three occasions had bcr-abl junction-specific CD8+ T cells. Specific T cells were more likely to be found in patients with a low leukemic burden (p=0.03). Three of 18 HLA-A3+ and/or HLA-B8+ healthy donors had bcr-abl junction-specific T cells, though these were not detected in any of 13 subjects who were HLA-A3- and HLA-B8-. Bcr-abl-specific T cells were expandable in vitro in three of seven healthy donors and five of seven CML patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Bcr-abl-specific T cells are detectable in CML patients, and might contribute to leukemic control. The occurrence of specific CD8+ T cells in some healthy donors might represent an immune response to occult BCR-ABL rearrangements.","['Butt, Nauman M', 'Rojas, Jose M', 'Wang, Lihui', 'Christmas, Stephen E', 'Abu-Eisha, Hazem M', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Butt NM', 'Rojas JM', 'Wang L', 'Christmas SE', 'Abu-Eisha HM', 'Clark RE']","['Department of Hematology, University of Liverpool, Prescot St., Liverpool L7 8XP, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*metabolism']",2005/10/13 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1315-23.,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Oct;90(10):1297B.

We show that a signaling protein, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3k), is essential for growth of CML cells, but not of normal hematopoietic cells, and that p85alpha subunit of PI-3k co-immunoprecipitates with BCR/ABL. Therefore, we made an attempt to better characterize p85alpha-BCR/ABL interactions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mutants of p85alpha-SH3 domain were generated by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system. Protein lysates were obtained from p210BCR/ABL-transformed murine 32Dcl3 myeloid cells, and in vitro transcription/translation was used to produce BCR/ABL protein. Pull-down and Western analyses were performed to detect the interaction between BCR/ABL and p85alpha-SH3. BCR/ABL-transformed 32Dcl3 cells were infected with internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein retroviral construct encoding p85alpha-SH3 mutants to assess their biological effects. RESULTS: We show here that the SH3 domain of p85alpha (p85alpha-SH3) pulls down the p210BCR/ABL kinase from hematopoietic cell lysates. The interaction between p85alpha-SH3 and BCR/ABL may be intermediated by proteins such as c-Cbl, Shc, Grb2, and/or Gab2.

To allow identification of the causes of this failure, we established an animal model of DLI in human ALL. METHODS: NOD/scid mice were inoculated with primary human ALL cells. Cells from five different patients were studied. After engraftment, DLI was performed by infusion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor T cells or HLA-disparate donor T cells. RESULTS: DLI resulted in expansion of activated, leukemia-reactive T cells in all donor-patient combinations. After 40 days of expansion, T cells abruptly declined in numbers and displayed loss of cytotoxicity. At this moment, remissions were observed in three of five donor-patient combinations. In animals engrafted with the two unresponsive ALL, remissions could be achieved when HLA-disparate DLI was given. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the inefficacy of DLI in ALL may be due to the limitation of the proliferative capacity of ALL-reactive T cells and that the antileukemic efficacy during the limited time span of proliferation depends on the antigenic disparity between the donor and the patient. The model can be used to study whether alternative strategies may result in more sustained antileukemic responses after DLI in ALL.","['Nijmeijer, Bart A', 'van Schie, Marianke L J', 'Verzaal, Perry', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Nijmeijer BA', 'van Schie ML', 'Verzaal P', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. b.a.nijmeijer@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', '*Living Donors', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/10/13 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00357-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.06.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Oct;33(10):1172-81. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.06.034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: NK/NK T-cell lines KHYG-1, NK-92, YT, and SNT-8 were compared with a novel flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay under different culture conditions. Transcription, expression, and phosphorylation studies were performed using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: KHYG-1 is a highly cytotoxic cell line, exceeding the cytolytic capacity of the other cell lines against K562. KHYG-1 is also highly cytotoxic against the leukemia cell lines EM2, EM3, and HL60. The novel activation receptor NKp44 and its adaptor, DAP12, NKG2D, and constitutively phosphorylated ERK2 may be associated with the enhanced cytotoxicity of KHYG-1. This cell line most likely mediates cytolysis by granzyme M (but not granzymes A and B) together with perforin, which is constitutively fully cleaved to the 60-kD form, in contrast to the other cell lines. CONCLUSION: KHYG-1 is a valuable model for the study of enhanced cytotoxicity by NK cells. In addition to the activation of NKp44, KHYG-1 may induce apoptosis of tumor cells by the newly described granzyme M/perforin pathway. Targeted modifications of effector molecules demonstrated in this model could generate NK cells with even greater killing ability that may be particularly attractive for clinical application. Moreover, our demonstration of greater cytotoxicity of KHYG-1 versus NK-92 cells, already in clinical trials, suggests a direct therapeutic role for KHYG-1.","['Suck, Garnet', 'Branch, Donald R', 'Smyth, Mark J', 'Miller, Richard G', 'Vergidis, Joanna', 'Fahim, Soad', 'Keating, Armand']","['Suck G', 'Branch DR', 'Smyth MJ', 'Miller RG', 'Vergidis J', 'Fahim S', 'Keating A']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital/Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. garnet.suck@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia/*immunology/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins', '*Models, Immunological', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/immunology']",2005/10/13 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00304-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.06.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Oct;33(10):1160-71. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.06.024.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (TYROBP protein, human)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMM protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bryostatin-1 (bryo), a protein kinase C (PKC) modulator, was investigated for its ability to increase IM-mediated apoptosis either through induction of cycling of G0/G1 Ph(+) cells or antagonism of the IM-induced cell-cycle block. METHODS: The Ph(+) K562 cell line and primary CD34(+) CML cells were studied for cell-cycle progression (PI staining), proliferation ((3)H thymidine uptake), and survival (dye exclusion). RESULTS: Following 48 hours exposure to IM, on average more than 80% of surviving K562 cells were in G0/G1 as compared to approximately 50% for untreated control cultures (p < 0.001). After accounting for IM-induced cell kill, the absolute number of viable G0/G1 cells was significantly increased, confirming its anti-proliferative effect. However, pretreatment for 24 hours with bryo both increased K562 total cell kill and normalized the percentage of cells recovered in G0/G1, thus reducing their absolute number. For primary CML CD34(+) cells, pretreatment with bryo prior to IM significantly enhanced cell death of both total and, critically, G0/G1 populations. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that carefully scheduled drug combinations that include an agent to antagonize the anti-proliferative effect of IM may prove more efficacious within the Ph(+) stem cell compartment than IM monotherapy.","['Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Allan, Elaine K', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Richmond, Linda', 'Harrison, Simon', 'Elliott, Moira A', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Jorgensen HG', 'Allan EK', 'Mountford JC', 'Richmond L', 'Harrison S', 'Elliott MA', 'Holyoake TL']","['Section of Experimental Haematology, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. hgj1b@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Bryostatins', 'Drug Antagonism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects']",2005/10/13 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00279-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.05.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Oct;33(10):1140-6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.05.020.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Leukemia was chemically induced in male WKAH/Hkm rats by a nitrosourea derivative, N-butylnitrosourea (BNU), an alkylating agent, administered orally 5 days a week for 24 weeks. Development of leukemia was monitored by clinical observation, follow-up of blood parameters, and appearance of blast cells in peripheral blood samples. The phenotype of the leukemia was determined by cytological examination, cytochemical reactions, and by immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells using various markers. The feasibility of leukemia transplantation was investigated. Clonality and karyotype analyses were also performed. RESULTS: We observed the appearance of acute leukemia in 60% of the rats treated with BNU. Of these, 65% developed pre-B-ALL, which was serially transplantable to healthy WKAH/Hkm male rats. Karyotype analysis did not reveal clonal abnormalities. Clonality determined by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement sequencing disclosed that the pre-B-ALL were mostly oligoclonal. CONCLUSION: This new in vivo model of inducible pre-B-ALL might be useful for investigating the effects of co-initiating or promoting agents suspected to be involved in leukemia development, and for disclosing new molecular events leading to leukemogenic processes.","['Bernard, Natacha', 'Devevey, Lionel', 'Jacquemont, Celine', 'Chretien, Pascale', 'Helissey, Philippe', 'Guillosson, Jean-Jacques', 'Arock, Michel', 'Nafziger, Joelle']","['Bernard N', 'Devevey L', 'Jacquemont C', 'Chretien P', 'Helissey P', 'Guillosson JJ', 'Arock M', 'Nafziger J']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Faculte de Pharmacie, Paris, France. nat_bernard@yahoo.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/pathology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*toxicity', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Rats']",2005/10/13 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00298-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.06.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Oct;33(10):1130-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.06.018.,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '869-01-2 (N-nitrosobutylurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the effect of interferon-gamma on icb-1alpha and beta mRNA levels in human cell lines derived from breast cancer and gynecological malignancies. Furthermore, we intended to approach icb-1 gene function by means of RNA interference (RNAi) to analyze the effect of an icb-1 knockdown on human cancer cells in vitro. Three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231), three ovarian cancer cell lines (SK-OV-3, OVCAR-3 and BG-1) and the endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC-1-A were treated with interferon gamma and the transcript levels of icb-1 isoforms alpha and beta were assessed by means of semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR.

Canidae (dog and fox) constitute the main reservoir hosts for the parasite, whilst wild rodents or the cat can be carriers of the protozoan and are considered as secondary potential reservoirs. This paper describes a case of disseminated feline leishmaniosis with cutaneous (ulcerative), visceral (spleen and lymph nodes) and blood involvement in a FIV-FelV positive cat. The microscopic identification of the Leishmania infection was initially made on a skin biopsy of the temporal area, where a squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed. The diagnosis of the disease was achieved by several serological techniques (ELISA, IFAT and Western-blot). The strain was obtained by blood culture, characterized by electrophoresis of isoenzymes and identified as Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1. Since the infection due to L. infantum is a zoonosis, the potential feline reservoir should be more investigated. Serological analysis by Western blot on domestic cats provides a useful tool. In veterinary practice, feline leishmaniosis should be systematically included in the differential diagnosis when compatible cutaneous lesions are present, especially in the endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis.","['Grevot, A', 'Jaussaud Hugues, P', 'Marty, P', 'Pratlong, F', 'Ozon, C', 'Haas, P', 'Breton, C', 'Bourdoiseau, G']","['Grevot A', 'Jaussaud Hugues P', 'Marty P', 'Pratlong F', 'Ozon C', 'Haas P', 'Breton C', 'Bourdoiseau G']","[""Ecole nationale veterinaire de Lyon, Laboratoire de parasitologie, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Parasite,"Parasite (Paris, France)",9437094,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications/*veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*parasitology', 'Cats', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Female', '*Leishmania infantum', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/complications/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Feline/*complications', 'Macrophages/parasitology/pathology']",2005/10/13 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/10/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1051/parasite/2005123271 [doi]'],ppublish,Parasite. 2005 Sep;12(3):271-5. doi: 10.1051/parasite/2005123271.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many chemicals, including benzene, pesticides (dithiocarbamines), ethylene oxide and metals (mercury, cadmium, chrome, cobalt, lead, aluminum) exert their toxic effect on the hematopoietic system. Exposure to each of these substances may occur in the work place due to environmental pollution and in municipal or residential areas. Exposure to lead, aluminum, cadmium, and benzene results in the incidence of anemia. In addition, exposure to benzene and its metabolites leads to myelodysplastic syndromes, leukemia, lymphomas and bone marrow aplasia. Ethylene oxide induces neoplasm of the hematopoietic system and lymphomas, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Arsenic compounds act like immunosuppressants. Mercury and chrome affect the immune system by immunosuppression and by evoking autoimmune reactions. Dithiocarbamates are suspected to induce leukemia. An analysis of the pathophysiology of individual substances reveal universal toxic mechanisms.

In addition, a variety of tumor cells overexpress cell-surface TF, which appears to be important for tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the upregulation of TF in human tumor cells, a comprehensive analysis of TF mRNA from various normal and tumor cells was performed. The results of these studies indicate that, in addition to possessing a normal full-length TF transcript and minor levels of an alternatively spliced transcript known as alternatively-spliced tissue factor (asTF), human tumor cells express additional full-length TF transcripts that are also generated by alternative splicing. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends- (5'-RACE) based analyses of cytoplasmic RNA from normal and tumor cells revealed that there is alternative splicing of the first intron between exon I and exon II resulting in 2 additional TF transcripts. One of the transcripts has an extended exon I with inclusion of most of the first TF intron (955 bp), while the second transcript is formed by the insertion of a 495 bp sequence, referred to as exon IA, derived from an internal sequence of the first intron. The full length TF transcript with alternatively spliced novel exon IA, referred to as alternative exon 1A-tissue factor (TF-A), represented approximately 1% of the total TF transcripts in normal cells, but constituted 7-10% of the total TF transcript in tumor cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that cultured human tumor cells contain 10-25-fold more copy numbers of TF-A in comparison to normal, untransformed cells. We propose that high-level expression of the novel TF-A transcript, preferentially in tumor cells, may have utility in the diagnosis and staging of a variety of solid tumors.","['Chand, Hitendra S', 'Ness, Scott A', 'Kisiel, Walter']","['Chand HS', 'Ness SA', 'Kisiel W']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/pathology', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Cytoplasm', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thromboplastin/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/10/12 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/10/12 09:00'],"['2005/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21550 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;118(7):1713-20. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21550.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",,,,,,"['R01 CA058443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL64119/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['GENBANK/AY940729', 'GENBANK/AY940730', 'GENBANK/AY940731']",,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, including TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B, are located within this chromosomal region. Since recent studies demonstrate that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and prostate cells are TRAIL induced apoptosis, TRAIL-receptors are strong tumor suppressor candidate genes in human cancers exhibiting loss of chromosomal material in 8p21.3. However, no mutation of the TRAIL receptor genes has been reported in CLL, MCL, prostate cancer, HNSCC so far. In this study we analyzed the complete coding region of TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B in a series of 32 MCL and 101 CLL samples and detected a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TNFRSF10A (A683C) with tumor specific allele distribution. We examined allele distribution in 395 samples of different tumor entities (prostate cancer, n = 43; HNSCC, n = 40; bladder cancer, n = 179) and compared them to 137 samples from healthy probands. We found the rare allele of TNFRSF10A is more frequent in CLL, MCL, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and HNSCC.

However, its therapeutic efficacy against solid tumors is lacking even at high dosages. Other therapeutic strategies are required to enhance the efficacy of As(2)O(3) against solid tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is refractory to chemotherapy. B7H3, a new member of the B7 family, has been shown to induce antitumor immunity. Intratumoral injection of B7H3 plasmids eradicates small EL-4 lymphomas, but monotherapy is ineffective against large tumors. Here we investigated whether As(2)O(3) would synergize with B7H3 immunotherapy to combat HCC. Large subcutaneous H22 HCCs (0.7-0.8 cm in diameter) established in BALB/c mice were rapidly and completely eradicated when intratumoral administration of As(2)O(3) was preceded by in situ gene transfer of B7H3. In contrast, neither As(2)O(3) nor B7H3 monotherapy was effective. The antitumor activity of As(2)O(3) was attributed to increased tumor-cell apoptosis, perhaps as a result of direct cytotoxicity as well as decreased tumor angiogenesis. Combination therapy generated potent systemic antitumor immunity mediated by CD8(+) and NK cells that was effective in combating a systemic challenge of 1 x 10(7) parental H22 cells. It led to the simultaneous and complete regression of multiple distant tumor nodules, concomitant with increased levels of serum IFN-gamma and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. In conclusion, combining B7H3-mediated immunotherapy with As(2)O(3) warrants investigation as a therapeutic strategy to combat HCC, and other malignancies.","['Luo, Liqiong', 'Qiao, Haiquan', 'Meng, Fanqiang', 'Dong, Xuesong', 'Zhou, Baoguo', 'Jiang, Hongchi', 'Kanwar, Jagat R', 'Krissansen, Geoffrey W', 'Sun, Xueying']","['Luo L', 'Qiao H', 'Meng F', 'Dong X', 'Zhou B', 'Jiang H', 'Kanwar JR', 'Krissansen GW', 'Sun X']","['The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center of Heilongjiang Province/Department of General Surgery, The First Clinical College of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'B7 Antigens', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Liver Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2005/10/12 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/10/12 09:00'],"['2005/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21557 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;118(7):1823-30. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21557.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (B7 Antigens)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD276 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published papers, as well as abstracts from European and American meetings, have been used together with original data. RECENT FINDINGS: The review shows that antithymocyte globulin is used frequently in Europe in the setting of unrelated or family mismatched donor transplants. This may not be the case for American centers, reluctant to introduce antithymocyte globulin possibly due to known side effects such as prolonged immune deficiency and increased incidence of infections, including life threatening Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. Results from few randomized trials show that antithymocyte globulin reduces acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and this is in keeping with results from retrospective analysis on large number of patients. SUMMARY: Several issues remain open, such as optimal dose, optimal timing with respect to infusion of stem cells and whether the commercially available agents have comparable effects. Prospective trials are needed to answer these important questions.","['Bacigalupo, Andrea']",['Bacigalupo A'],"['Divisione Ematologia II, Ospedale San Martino, 16132 Genova, Italy. andrea.bacigalupo@hsanmartino.liguria.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2005/10/12 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/10/12 09:00'],"['2005/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200511000-00005 [pii]', '10.1097/01.moh.0000183726.42063.ec [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2005 Nov;12(6):457-62. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000183726.42063.ec.,,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multilobulated nuclear appearance is an important diagnostic marker of ATLL, and we have now identified that the molecular mechanisms underlying these formations occur through microtubule rearrangement via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activation by AILIM/ICOS signaling. We also show that PTEN and/or SHIP-1, which are PIP3 inositol phosphatases that inhibit the activation of downstream effectors of the PI3-kinase cascade, are disrupted in both ATLL neoplasias and in multilobulated nuclei-forming Jurkat cells. This down-regulation of PTEN was found to be essential for the formation of ATLL-type nuclear lobules. Furthermore, PI3-kinase and PTEN activities were observed to be closely associated with cellular proliferation. Thus, our results suggest that alteration of PI3-kinase signaling cascades, as a result of the down-regulation of inositol phosphatases, induces ATLL-type multilobulated nuclear formation and is also associated with the cellular proliferation of malignant T cell leukemias/lymphomas.","['Fukuda, Ryu-ichi', 'Hayashi, Ayako', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Nukada, Yuko', 'Fukui, Rie', 'Itoh, Katsuhiko', 'Tezuka, Katsunari', 'Ohashi, Kazumasa', 'Mizuno, Kensaku', 'Sakamoto, Manabu', 'Hamanoue, Masahiro', 'Tsuji, Takashi']","['Fukuda R', 'Hayashi A', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Nukada Y', 'Fukui R', 'Itoh K', 'Tezuka K', 'Ohashi K', 'Mizuno K', 'Sakamoto M', 'Hamanoue M', 'Tsuji T']","['Department of Biological Science and Technology, Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', '*Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/virology']",2005/10/12 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/12 09:00'],"['2005/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['0507184102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0507184102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 18;102(42):15213-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0507184102.

The results showed that people who have been diagnosed with ALL can have decrements in BMD. The etiology of BMD decrements can be attributed to multiple factors including genetic endowment, lifestyle behaviors, the leukemia disease process, and treatment exposures especially to corticosteroids and cranial radiotherapy. Male gender, age greater than 10 years, and physical inactivity are associated with BMD decrements in ALL survivors.

Particularly, we have focused on experiences related to diagnosis announcement, hospitalisation and treatments and consequences on their social, psychological and somatic behaviour. PATIENTS: Forty-one patients cured of ALL have been enrolled in the study and answered one interview with clinical psychologist or research nurse. RESULTS: Although 60% of the patients argued that they think rarely of their disease, 10% thought about it every day. Traumatic evidence was detectable in most of them. Physical pain was the most reported stress, mainly during hospitalisation (93%), as well as psychological suffering (83%). Afterwards, the mostly often-reported stress was psychological pain (61%). Sixty-six percent declared that they still experience psychological and health consequences at the time of the interview, in some cases reported as a handicap in their life. In 83% of the cases they considered themselves as cured, nevertheless fear of relapse persisted in 1/3. Ninety percent said they have a pleasant life, 56% did not like to talk about leukaemia and 70% thought they could have died. For 85%, disease has been the most important event of their life and 75% testify to repercussions of the disease on their family (family relationship changes, overprotection, siblings difficulties). CONCLUSION: Most of these patients declared to be 'as the others' and developed life projects, but overcoming the pain experience of the disease remained difficult. This study emphasized the need for long-term continuous information and reinforces the importance of addressing treatment psychological and physical pain mainly after the initial hospitalisation period.","['Vaudre, G', 'Trocme, N', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Maout, F', 'Tabone, M D', 'Tourniaire, B', 'Gouraud, F', 'Dollfus, C', 'Auvrignon, A', 'Leverger, G']","['Vaudre G', 'Trocme N', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Maout F', 'Tabone MD', 'Tourniaire B', 'Gouraud F', 'Dollfus C', 'Auvrignon A', 'Leverger G']","[""Service d'hematologie et d'oncologie pediatrique, hopital d'enfants Armand-Trousseau, Assistance publique-hopitaux de Paris, 75012 Paris, France. genevieve.vaudre@trs.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family Relations', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pain/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2005/10/12 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/12 09:00'],"['2004/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-693X(05)00479-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcped.2005.07.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2005 Nov;12(11):1591-9. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2005.07.017.

Among the four extracts, only the aqueous and ethyl acetate ones showed an apparent effect on the tested biological activities, whereas the butanolic extract and the essential oil did not show any interesting effect (data not shown). These results showed that the aqueous and ethyl extracts of this endemic species are of interest for two reasons: stimulation of the immunizing system and protection against the stress by a neurotropic activity. Thyme extracts increased in vivo the number of leucocyte categories studied including polynuclears, total lymphocytes, TCD4+, TCD8+ and NK cells. These data suggest that the intraperitoneal administration of Thymus broussonetii extract has a potent direct effect on leucocytes in vivo. The elevation of leucocyte and thrombocyte counts produced by thyme in the peripheral blood was already reported in the literature.

The mechanism by which PML plays a role in the regulation of cell death is still unknown. Our previous study demonstrated that overexpression of PML suppress the growth of bladder cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. To further elucidate the mechanism of PML induced apoptosis in bladder cancer, we constructed a PML inducible stable cell line. We found that the increased expression of PML significantly inhibit the growth of the UM-UC-2/PML clone cells and present apparent massive apoptosis in 24 h post-induction, while the UM-UC-2/PMEP4 cells are not. We also examined the effect of PML on the cell cycle distribution in UM-UC-2 cells. We showed overexpression of PML cause a cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. In additional, increased expression of PML in bladder cancer UM-UC-2 cells reduce Survivin expression and up regulated Caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expression, these suggested that PML might regulate apoptosis through Caspase dependent pathways.

For Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), co-packaged RNAs are not randomly selected from among all packaging-competent RNAs, but instead primarily associate as homodimers. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the distance between proviral templates might hinder RNA heterodimerization, thus generating the observed preferential homodimerization of co-expressed MLV RNAs. To do this, two genetically distinct RNAs were co-expressed from a single locus and the proportions of hetero- and homodimeric virion RNAs were determined. Unlike RNAs transcribed from two different templates, RNAs transcribed from a single locus dimerized at random. Additionally, in vitro transcription experiments suggested that MLV RNA dimerization can occur more efficiently for longer RNAs during transcription than post-synthesis.

In DNA damage response, p53 is recruited into PML-NBs and modified by phosphorylations and acetylations, which in turn potentiate its transcriptional and pro-apoptotic activities. In contrast, in carcinoma cells, the role of PML in the irradiation induced p53-mediated apoptosis is not precisely understood. In this study, we have used the breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, and stably suppressed the expression of PML. Inhibition of PML expression had no detectable effect on the expression of endogenous p53 at the mRNA level; however, a significant decrease of p53 protein was observed. There was also an increase in the p53-MDM2 complexes, which may facilitate p53 protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, also in irradiation treated cells. The p53 transcriptional activity was attenuated both in unstressed and 10 Gy irradiation treated cells.

METHODS: Sixty-two children with ALL were investigated. The expression of fusion genes was determined by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), karyotyping (R band) and immunophenotyping (by flow cytometry) were also performed. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients, 23(37.1%) were found to carry 13 different fusion genes. The patients with immunophenotype of Pre-B-ALL were found to carry: TEL/AML1(3 cases); E2A/PBX1, E2A/HLF, TLS/ERG, MLL/AF4, MLL/AF9, MLL/AF10, MLL/AFX-MLL/AF6-MLL/ELL, MLL/AF6-MLL/ELL, dupMLL (one case for each); and HOX11 (6 cases). The patients with immunophenotype of Pre-T-ALL were found to carry: TAL1D (4 cases, one is also found to have HOX11 expression); and HOX11 (2 cases). The multiplex RT-PCR in combination with chromosome analysis revealed genetic abnormalities in 69.4%(43/62) of childhood ALL. CONCLUSION: Multiplex RT-PCR combined with chromosome analysis and immunophenotyping can provide reliable and helpful information for the diagnosis, therapy evaluation and prognosis prediction in childhood ALL, which may also serve as a basis on which to implement the criteria of WHO classification.","['He, Jun', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Xue, Yong-quan', 'Li, Jian-qin', 'He, Hai-long', 'Huang, Yi-ping', 'He, Ya-xiang', 'Chai, Yi-huan', 'Zhu, Ling-li']","['He J', 'Chen ZX', 'Xue YQ', 'Li JQ', 'He HL', 'Huang YP', 'He YX', 'Chai YH', 'Zhu LL']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, PR China. junhe1964@sina.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2005/10/11 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['940622136 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Oct;22(5):551-3.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF10 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-ELL fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding frequent focal signs and symptoms in NM, NM is a disease affecting the entire neuraxis and therefore staging and treatment need encompass all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. Central nervous system (CNS) staging of NM includes contrast enhanced cranial computerized tomography (CE-CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MR-Gd), contrast enhanced spine magnetic resonance imaging (MR-S) or computerized tomographic myelography (CT-M) and radionuclide CSF flow study (FS). Treatment of NM involves involved-field radiotherapy of bulky or symptomatic disease sites and intra-CSF drug therapy. The inclusion of concomitant systemic therapy may benefit patients with NM and may obviate the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy. At present, intra-CSF drug therapy is confined to three chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside and thio-TEPA) administered by a variety of schedules either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Although treatment of NM is palliative with an expected median patient survival of 4 to 6 months, it often affords stabilization and protection from further neurologic deterioration in patients with NM. In patients with leukemia or lymphoma, prophylaxis of the CNS is used (utilizing a combination of high-dose systemic chemotherapy and intra-CSF chemotherapy) for patients at high risk as defined by specific tumor-related laboratory markers. Using such a risk-stratified approach, the late occurrence of CNS relapse has decreased dramatically attesting to the value of CNS prophylaxis.","['Chamberlain, Marc C', 'Nolan, Craig', 'Abrey, Lauren E']","['Chamberlain MC', 'Nolan C', 'Abrey LE']","['Department of Neurology, University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Meningitis, Aseptic/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2005/10/11 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-004-8100-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2005 Oct;75(1):71-83. doi: 10.1007/s11060-004-8100-y.,,,,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects in the distal mitochondrial pathway were more common in samples from patients with AML that relapsed rapidly after induction chemotherapy compared to samples from treatment naive patients. The incidence of blocked pathways did not differ based on response to induction chemotherapy, as even nonresponders generally had an intact pathway. When the distal mitochondrial pathway was blocked, defects were usually at the level of the effector caspases. Thus, functional defects in the distal portion of the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation may help explain the nature of response and relapse after treatment.","['Gronda, M', 'Brandwein, J', 'Minden, M D', 'Pond, G R', 'Schuh, A C', 'Wells, R A', 'Messner, H', 'Chun, K', 'Schimmer, A D']","['Gronda M', 'Brandwein J', 'Minden MD', 'Pond GR', 'Schuh AC', 'Wells RA', 'Messner H', 'Chun K', 'Schimmer AD']","['The Princess Margaret Hospital and the Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Models, Biological']",2005/10/11 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-005-2764-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2005 Dec;10(6):1285-94. doi: 10.1007/s10495-005-2764-4.,,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most previous studies have been too small to estimate accurately risks of specific categories of lymphoproliferative malignancies in relatives of NHL cases or to quantify the contribution of NHL case characteristics to familial risk. We have overcome sample size limitations and potential recall bias by using large databases from Sweden and Denmark. Diagnoses of lymphoproliferative malignancies were compared in 70,006 first-degree relatives of 26,089 NHL cases (including 7,432 with subtype information) versus 161,352 first-degree relatives of 58,960 matched controls. Relatives of NHL cases were at significantly increased risk for NHL [relative risk (RR), 1.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.39-2.15], Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.0-1.97), and nonsignificantly for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.93-1.85). No increased risk was found for multiple myeloma among case relatives. Findings with respect to siblings compared with parents and offspring or with respect to age at diagnosis of proband were inconsistent. In both populations, relatives of cases with an aggressive NHL subtype were at substantially increased risk of NHL (combined RR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.80-7.02). We conclude that NHL has an important familial component, which is shared with Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL.

Tobacco use, including exposure to secondhand smoke has been implicated as a causal or contributory agent in an ever-expanding list of cancers, including lung, oral cavity and pharynx, pancreas, liver, kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, uterine cervix, and myeloid leukemia. In addition to and independent of the etiologic effects of tobacco carcinogens in numerous cancers, there is a growing literature on the direct and indirect effects of smoking on treatment efficacy (short-term and long-term outcomes), toxicity and morbidity, quality of life (QOL), recurrence, second primary tumors (SPT), and survival time as summarized below. Oncology health professionals have called for increased advocacy for tobacco control. Despite the critical relevance of smoking to cancer outcomes, most oncology clinical trials do not collect data on smoking history and status unless the malignancy is widely acknowledged as smoking related (e.g., lung or head and neck cancer). Usually, these data are collected only at trial registration. Changes in smoking status during treatment or follow-up are monitored in very few trials and are infrequently reported in sample descriptions or included in analysis plans as a potential moderator of outcomes. Based on mounting evidence that tobacco use affects cancer treatment outcomes and survival, we recommend that smoking history and status be systematically collected as core data in all oncology clinical trials: at diagnosis, at trial registration, and throughout treatment and follow-up to long-term survival or death. We feel that the inclusion and analysis of such data in clinical trials will add important information to the interpretation of outcomes and the development of scientific knowledge in this area. Smoking status has been called another ""vital sign"" because of its relevance to a patient's immediate medical condition. We explain the critical value of knowing the smoking status of every patient with cancer at every visit by providing a brief overview of the following research findings: (a) the effects of tobacco use on cancer treatment and outcome; (b) recent findings on the role of nicotine in malignant processes; (c) some unexpected results concerning tobacco status, treatment, and disease outcome; and (d) identifying key questions that remain to be addressed.

Imatinib's target is a novel constitutively-active kinase.

We previously observed by gene profiling that sorcin is significantly up-regulated in a doxorubicin-induced MDR leukemia cell line, K562/A02, over its parent cells. We have also demonstrated that the level of sorcin expression in leukemia patients correlates not only directly with that of the mdr1 gene, but also inversely with patients' response to chemotherapies and overall prognosis. In this report, we have carried out experiments to dissect out the contribution of sorcin by itself to drug resistant phenotype in K562 cells. Overexpression of sorcin protein by gene transfection in K562 cells resulted in increased drug resistance, from 4.1- to 22.5-fold, to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, etoposide, homoharringtonine and vincristine. On the other hand, inhibition of sorcin expression in both MDR K562/A02 and the sorcin-transfected K562 cells with sorcin-targeting small interfering RNA led to varying extent of reversal of drug resistance. These results confirm that sorcin is an important gene associated with the development of MDR in leukemia cells.","['Zhou, Yuan', 'Xu, Yuanfu', 'Tan, Yaohong', 'Qi, Jing', 'Xiao, Ying', 'Yang, Chunzheng', 'Zhu, Zhenping', 'Xiong, Dongsheng']","['Zhou Y', 'Xu Y', 'Tan Y', 'Qi J', 'Xiao Y', 'Yang C', 'Zhu Z', 'Xiong D']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",2005/10/11 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00331-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.08.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Apr;30(4):469-76. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.08.024.

The benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin has been shown to bind to Hsp90 and to specifically inhibit this chaperone's function, resulting in client protein destabilization. 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is a chemical derivative of geldanamycin.

Kasumi-1 is t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line harboring mutated KIT with Asn822Lys substitution. Our present studies demonstrate that 17-AAG inhibits Kasumi-1 cells proliferation and exerts apoptosis- and differentiation-inducing effects in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The growth-inhibitory IC50 value for 17-AAG treatment is 0.62mumol/L. Characteristic apoptotic features were confirmed by morphology, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and annexin V staining. 17-AAG also causes the G0/G1 block of Kasumi-1 cells. Significantly, 17-AAG-induced apoptosis of Kasumi-1 cells is associated with a decline in KIT protein level.

Here we report on the incidence and clinical features of this genetic defect in a series of 30 consecutive adult T-cell ALL patients. Multiple copies of the ABL1 gene were detected in two patients (6.6%), one with the karyotype 46,XY,t(1;3)(p36;p21),del(6)(q23)/46,XY and the other without analyzable metaphases. Metaphase/interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected multiple uncountable signals corresponding to ABL1 in mitotic cells and nuclei from both patients. In one patient, no signals corresponded with the 9p21 chromosomal region, which contains the p16INK4a gene, and in the other one signal was observed. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that in these patients ABL1 gene expression was 14- and 18-fold greater than in normal controls, and returned to normal levels only when complete remission was achieved. We reached the following conclusions: (1) FISH is the only technique that promptly identifies T-cell ALL patients with ABL1 amplification, (2) quick identification with FISH is fundamental in the clinic because this T-cell ALL subset is imatinib sensitive but may become resistant due to development of additional mutations, and (3) ABL1 quantitative RT-PCR may be easily applied to monitor minimal residual disease.","['Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Calatroni, Silvia', 'Giardini, Ilaria', 'Inzoli, Alessandro', 'Castagnola, Carlo', 'Cavigliano, Paola Maria', 'Rocca, Barbara', 'Boni, Marina', 'Quarna, Jessica', 'Zappatore, Rita', 'Caresana, Marilena', 'Bianchessi, Clara', 'Pallavicini, Enrico Bobbio', 'Lazzarino, Mario']","['Bernasconi P', 'Calatroni S', 'Giardini I', 'Inzoli A', 'Castagnola C', 'Cavigliano PM', 'Rocca B', 'Boni M', 'Quarna J', 'Zappatore R', 'Caresana M', 'Bianchessi C', 'Pallavicini EB', 'Lazzarino M']","['Division of Hematology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Piazzale Golgi No. 5, 27100 Pavia, Italy. p.bernasconi@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Aged', 'Child', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/10/11 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2004/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(05)00205-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Oct 15;162(2):146-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.04.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-one bone marrow samples were analyzed with FISH, using ETV6/RUNX1 DNA probes. Abnormalities of ETV6, RUNX1, or both were found in 31 of the 71 (44%) patients. Six showed ETV6/RUNX1 fusion and 17, with extra RUNX1 copies, presented an additional chromosome 21 or dup(21)(q22). Five patients had structural changes in ETV6, and three patients showed extra copies of ETV6 and RUNX1 from polysomy of chromosomes 12 and 21. Our results revealed a fusion in 8.5% of the 71 cases analyzed. This frequency is lower than that observed in other populations (9.5-32%). The structural rearrangements resulting in RUNX1 extra copies were found in 9.8% of patients, which is close to the range reported (1.5-9.7%) by other authors.

No data currently exist regarding FLT3 mutations in Southeast Asian patients. In this study, the incidence and type of FLT3 mutation in a large series of Thai AML patients were determined. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations were observed in 24.6%, FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations in 3.1%, and dual mutations in 2.7% of 256 newly diagnosed Thai AML patients. ITD mutations were mostly restricted to the juxtamembrane domain, and the in-frame ITD length varied from 21 to 201 base pairs. Six types of point mutations were identified, including Asp835Tyr, Asp835His, Asp835Glu, Asp835Ala, Ile836, and a novel mutation, Asp835Del/Ile836Val, which resulted in the loss of aspartic acid and substitution of isoleucine by valine. A rare leukemia karyotype, trisomy 11, was found to coexist with this novel FLT3 mutation, whereas the majority of patients with FLT3 mutations had a normal karyotype. Overall, FLT3 mutation was associated with a significantly higher white blood cell count and older age than the wild-type FLT3. In conclusion, the incidence of FLT3 mutation in Thailand is as high as that of western countries. The clinical significance of the novel mutation requires further studies in a larger population.","['Auewarakul, Chirayu U', 'Sritana, Narongrit', 'Limwongse, Chanin', 'Thongnoppakhun, Wanna', 'Yenchitsomanus, Pa-thai']","['Auewarakul CU', 'Sritana N', 'Limwongse C', 'Thongnoppakhun W', 'Yenchitsomanus PT']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. chirayuaue@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asians', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Thailand']",2005/10/11 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(05)00169-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Oct 15;162(2):127-34. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.03.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, renal involvement, including membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and minimal change disease, has been described as a manifestation of chronic GVHD. This case report describes a patient who developed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis after HSCT. Following preparation with chemotherapy, a 29-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukemia underwent allogenic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation, after which first acute and then chronic GVHD developed. Treatment with prednisone resulted in improvement in the patient's GVHD. After the termination of steroid therapy and about 10 months after PBSC transplantation, nephritic syndrome appeared and the patient's serum creatinine value increased to 1.7 mg/dL. Laboratory evaluation revealed perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) in the serum. Histological examination of renal biopsy tissue showed focal segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis with glomerulosclerosis in 20% of available glomeruli, large cellular crescents in 6% of glomeruli, and no staining of immunoglobulins or complement along the capillary walls. Electron microscopy revealed no immune deposits. After treatment with prednisone 60 mg/d, diltiazem 120 mg/d, and enalapril 10 mg/d, the proteinuria gradually decreased, and p-ANCA was undetectable.

The different subtypes are characterized by certain clinical features and specific laboratory findings. Large clinical trials have confirmed the important impact of the underlying biology of each subtype for clinical outcome. Improvements in patient's treatment resulting in better survival rates are closely linked to the biological understanding of the disease subtypes, which is assessed by specific diagnostic approaches. Thus, several diagnostic techniques are mandatory at diagnosis for classification and for individual therapeutic decisions. Furthermore they are also needed for follow up studies focusing especially on minimal residual disease (MRD) to guide further treatment decisions based on the response of the disease to given treatment protocols. Only by using a comprehensive diagnostic panel including cytomorphology, cytochemistry, multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular genetic methods the correct diagnosis in acute leukemias can be established today.

Due to its excellent hematologic and cytogenetic responses, particularly in patients with chronic phase CML, imatinib has moved towards first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. Nevertheless, resistance to the drug has been frequently reported and is attributed to the fact that transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by BCR-ABL is associated with genomic instability. Point mutations within the ABL tyrosine kinase of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein are the major cause of resistance, though overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein and novel acquired cytogenetic aberrations have also been reported. A variety of strategies derived from structural studies of the ABL-imatinib complex have been developed, resulting in the design of novel ABL inhibitors, including AMN107, BMS-354825, ON012380 and others. The major goal of these efforts is to create new drugs that are more potent than imatinib and/or more effective against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clones. Some of these drugs have already been successfully tested in preclinical studies where they show promising results. Additional approaches are geared towards targeting the expression or stability of the BCR-ABL kinase itself or targeting signaling pathways that are chronically activated and required for transformation. In this review, we will discuss the underlying mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and novel targeted approaches to overcome imatinib resistance in CML.","['Walz, Christoph', 'Sattler, Martin']","['Walz C', 'Sattler M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2005/10/11 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(05)00145-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2005.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2006 Feb;57(2):145-64. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2005.06.007.

The two most sensitive and quantitative methods for MRD detection are multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Fusion gene-specific PCR in AML is based on the RNA level, and thus in contrast to MFC expression levels rather than cell counts are assessed. For both methods independent prognostic values have been shown. The strong power of MFC has been shown mainly in the assessment of early clearance of the malignant clone. MRD levels in AML with fusion genes have the strongest prognostic power after the end of consolidation therapy. In addition, with QRT-PCR highly predictive initial expression levels can be assessed. With both methods early detection of relapse is possible. So far, validated PCR-based MRD was done with fusion genes that are detectable in only 20-25% of all AML MFC is superior since it is applicable for most AML. However, QRT-PCR is still more sensitive in most cases. Thus, it is desirable to establish new molecular markers for PCR-based studies.

Previously, we have shown that IL-22 plays a protective role in T cell-mediated hepatitis induced by Concanavalin A (Con A), acting as a survival factor for hepatocytes. In the present paper, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic gene delivery of IL-22 cDNA driven either by a liver-specific albumin promoter or a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter results in IL-22 protein expression, STAT3 activation, and expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 in the liver. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that IL-22 protein expression is mainly detected in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Overexpression of IL-22 by hydrodynamic gene delivery significantly protects against liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis induced by administration of Con A, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), or the Fas agonist Jo-2 mAb. Western blot analyses show that overexpression of IL-22 significantly enhances activation of STAT3 and expression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 proteins in liver injury induced by Con A. In conclusion, hydrodynamic gene delivery of IL-22 protects against liver injury induced by a variety of toxins, suggesting the therapeutic potential of IL-22 in treating human liver disease.","['Pan, Hongna', 'Hong, Feng', 'Radaeva, Svetlana', 'Gao, Bin']","['Pan H', 'Hong F', 'Radaeva S', 'Gao B']","['Section on Liver Biology, Laboratory of Physiologic Studies, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Tetrachloride/*toxicity', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/pathology/prevention & control', 'Concanavalin A/*metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Liver/pathology/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2005/10/11 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2004 Feb;1(1):43-9.,,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greater understanding of NK cell biology, from activating and inhibitory receptor functions to the role of NK cells in allogeneic transplantation, needs to be appreciated in order to draw out the clinical potential of NK cells. Mechanisms of bone marrow cell (BMC) rejection are known to be dependent on inhibitory receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and on activating receptors that have many potential ligands. The modulation of activating and inhibitory receptors may hold the key to clinical success involving NK cells. Pre-clinical studies in mice have shown that different combinations of activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells can reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), promote engraftment, and provide superior graft-versus-tumor (GVT) responses. Recent clinical data have shown that the use of KIR-ligand incompatibility produces tremendous graft-versus-leukemia effect in patients with acute myeloid leukemia at high risk of relapse.

The purpose of the present study was to analyze the effects of chemotherapy on various levels of visuomotor control in survivors of childhood ALL treated without cranial irradiation, and to identify risk factors for possible deficits. Visuomotor function was compared between children after treatment for ALL (n = 34), children after treatment for Wilms tumor, which consists of non-CNS directed chemotherapy (n = 38), and healthy controls (n = 151). Three tasks were administered: a simple visual reaction time task and two tasks measuring visuomotor control with one requiring a higher level of cognitive control than the other. Visuomotor deficits were detected only in the ALL group, with poorer performance restricted to the condition requiring the highest level of control. Significant risk factors for poorer performance were female gender and a short time since end of treatment, and a trend was found for a young age at diagnosis.

The trans isomer, AMD443 (1), is also cytotoxic in a variety of cancer cell lines. The X-ray crystal structure of the trans isomer (1) shows that the pyridine ring is tilted by 69 degrees with respect to the platinum square-plane in contrast to the cis isomer in which it is almost perpendicular (103 degrees ). In the 3-picoline (2) and 4-picoline (3) trans isomers, the ring is tilted by 58 degrees /60 degrees (2 molecules/unit cell) and by 56 degrees , respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important step in the intracellular activation and anticancer mechanism of action of these complexes. The first hydrolysis step is relatively fast even at 277 K, with rate constants (determined by 1H,15N NMR) of k1 = 2.6 x 10(-5) s(-1), 12.7 x 10(-5) s(-1), and 5.2 x 10(-5) s(-1) (I = 0.1 M) for formation of the monoaqua complexes of 1-3, respectively. Although the hydrolysis of 3 is slower than 2, it is hydrolyzed to a greater extent. No formation of the diaqua complex was observed for any of the three complexes at 277 K, and it accounts for <3% of the platinum species at 310 K. In general the extent of hydrolysis of the trans complexes is much less than for their cis analogues. The pK(a) values for the monoaqua adducts of 1-3 were determined to be 5.55, 5.35, and 5.39, respectively, suggesting that they would exist largely as the monohydroxo complex at physiological pH. The pKa values for the diaqua adducts were determined to be 4.03 and 7.01 for 1, 3.97 and 6.78 for 2, and 3.94 and 6.88 for 3, the first pK(a) being >1 unit lower than for related cis complexes.","['McGowan, Geraldine', 'Parsons, Simon', 'Sadler, Peter J']","['McGowan G', 'Parsons S', 'Sadler PJ']","[""School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JJ, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Inorg Chem,Inorganic chemistry,0366543,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Picolines/*chemistry']",2005/10/11 09:00,2006/07/13 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ic050763t [doi]'],ppublish,Inorg Chem. 2005 Oct 17;44(21):7459-67. doi: 10.1021/ic050763t.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Picolines)', '14913-33-8 (transplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two phenolic glucosides exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Furthermore, when the HL-60 cells were treated with eutigoside C, several apoptotic characteristics such as DNA fragmentation, morphologic changes, and increase of the population of sub-G1 hypodiploid cells were observed. In order to understand the mechanism of apoptosis induction by eutigoside C, we examined the changes of Bcl-2 and Bax expression levels. The eutigoside C reduced Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, but slightly increased Bax protein and mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. When we examined the activation of caspase-3, an effector of apoptosis, the eutigoside C increased the expression of active form (19-kDa) of caspase-3 and the increase of their activities was demonstrated by the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, a substrate of caspase-3, to 85-kDa. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of eutigoside C from E. emarginata on the growth of HL-60 appears to arise from the induction of apoptosis via the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and the activation of caspase.","['Park, Soo Yeong', 'Yang, Hong Chul', 'Moon, Ji Young', 'Lee, Nam Ho', 'Kim, Se Jae', 'Kang, Ji Hoon', 'Lee, Young Ki', 'Park, Deok Bae', 'Yoo, Eun Sook', 'Kang, Hee Kyoung']","['Park SY', 'Yang HC', 'Moon JY', 'Lee NH', 'Kim SJ', 'Kang JH', 'Lee YK', 'Park DB', 'Yoo ES', 'Kang HK']","['Department of Medicine, Cheju National University, Jeju 690-756, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Coumarins', 'Glucosides/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Phenols/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Theaceae/*chemistry']",2005/10/11 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/11 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02977400 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2005 Sep;28(9):1047-52. doi: 10.1007/BF02977400.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (eutigoside A)', '0 (eutigoside C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different approaches have been adopted in the treatment of ALCL in various cooperative trials, including short high-dose intensive therapy and leukemia-like protocols. In the early 1990s, the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP) initiated a multicenter trial for the treatment of ALCL based on a modified LSA2-L2 protocol. METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive eligible children with newly diagnosed ALCL were enrolled in the AIEOP LNH-92 protocol. Treatment was comprised of an induction of remission phase, followed by consolidation and maintenance for a total duration of 24 months, independently of disease stage. RESULTS: Thirty of 34 patients (88%) achieved complete disease remission and 8 patients experienced disease recurrence. With a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the probabilities of survival and event-free survival were 85% (range, 79-91%) and 65% (range, 57-73%), respectively. Therapy was well tolerated and hematologic toxicity was the most frequent toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The leukemia-like protocol AIEOP LNH-92 was found to be an effective treatment for childhood ALCL.

METHODS: The authors evaluated ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry in 201 untreated patients and correlated ZAP-70 levels with CD38 expression, genetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the time from diagnosis to first treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (28%) were positive for ZAP-70 (> or = 20%). Positive ZAP-70 status was associated with advanced disease stage, atypical morphology, CD38-positive status, trisomy 12, del(6q), or no detectable abnormalities; negative ZAP-70 status was correlated with del(13q) as a sole abnormality. The treatment-free interval (TFI) was 17.7 months for ZAP-70-positive patients and 44.6 months for ZAP-70-negative patients (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis in 117 patients identified advanced stage, CD38 > or = 7%, and the absence of del(13q) as a sole abnormality as independent factors for short TFI. Excluding FISH, ZAP-70 status acquired independent prognostic value along with CD38 status. The authors proposed a risk model that combines ZAP-70 and CD38 to identify patients who are likely to progress. When both markers were positive, the TFI was 12 months; when both were negative, the median TFI was 54 months; a median TFI of 26 months was observed in patients who had discordant results (P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggested that both ZAP-70 and CD38 should be tested prospectively in all patients with early-stage CLL.","['Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Morilla, Alison', 'Osuji, Nnenna', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Morilla, Ricardo', 'Burford, Anna', 'Maravelaki, Sonia', 'Owusu-Ankomah, Kwasi', 'Swansbury, John', ""A'Hern, Roger"", 'Brito-Babapulle, Vasantha', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Del Giudice I', 'Morilla A', 'Osuji N', 'Matutes E', 'Morilla R', 'Burford A', 'Maravelaki S', 'Owusu-Ankomah K', 'Swansbury J', ""A'Hern R"", 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Catovsky D']","['Section of Hemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis']",2005/10/08 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21437 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Nov 15;104(10):2124-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21437.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of the cytogenetic findings of these and other cases of LL reveals that clonal aberrations are common and most frequently involve T-cell receptor gene regions. The aberrations show some features similar to those of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and are not unique to LL, thus furnishing additional evidence of the equivalence of these two diseases. The cytogenetic features of LL may be helpful in the diagnosis of pediatric lymphomas and undifferentiated neoplasms.","['Ellison, Dale A', 'Parham, David M', 'Sawyer, Jeffrey R']","['Ellison DA', 'Parham DM', 'Sawyer JR']","[""Department of Pathology, Arkansas Children's Hospital, 800 Marshall Street, Little Rock, Arkansas 72202, USA. ellisondalea@uams.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/12/21 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10024-005-0050-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2005 Sep-Oct;8(5):550-6. doi: 10.1007/s10024-005-0050-7.

All these European trial data were reviewed on the basis of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk criteria and the response criteria as recently published by an international working group. To investigate the results in a larger cohort of patients and to determine risk factors, all data were pooled with some observations from the PCH 95-06 US phase II study. The response rate in the 177 patients evaluated (median age 70 years) was 49%. The median response duration was 36 weeks, and the median survival was 15 months. Analysis of the data according to sex, age, French-American-British classification, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, IPSS risk group, lactate dehydrogenase and cytogenetics did not reveal any factor predictive of response. Overall, 69% of patients benefited, including those with stable disease during therapy. Response duration was significantly shorter with increasing risk (according to the IPSS classification). Haemoglobin level and neutrophil count showed an inverse correlation to the IPSS classification. Univariate analysis showed a significantly inferior survival for elderly patients (>75 years of age) and for those with high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (more than two times the normal values). Patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities according to the IPSS risk criteria showed better overall survival than those with intermediate-risk abnormalities. When analysed according to the IPSS risk classification, high-risk patients had worse survival prospects following decitabine therapy than those with intermediate risk; however, compared to the originally reported IPPS outcomes for high-risk patients, they probably showed better survival. During the treatment period, 18% of the patients progressed towards acute leukaemia. Decitabine showed a rather low toxicity profile in this elderly patient group. In conclusion, low-dose decitabine is an active drug for the treatment of MDS patients, even for those older than 75 years with bad prognostic characteristics.","['Wijermans, P W', 'Lubbert, M', 'Verhoef, G', 'Klimek, V', 'Bosly, A']","['Wijermans PW', 'Lubbert M', 'Verhoef G', 'Klimek V', 'Bosly A']","['Department of Haematology, Leyenburg Hospital, The Hague, The Netherlands.

In this study, we sought to determine if PBOX-6, a well characterised member of the PBOX series of compounds, is also an effective inhibitor of breast cancer growth. Two estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7 and T-47-D) and two ER-negative (MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3) cell lines were examined. The 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine reduction in cell viability. PBOX-6 reduced the cell viability of all four cell lines tested, regardless of ER status, with IC(50) values ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 microM. PBOX-6 was most effective in the SK-BR-3 cells, which express high endogenous levels of the HER-2 oncogene. Overexpression of the HER-2 oncogene has been associated with aggressive disease and resistance to chemotherapy. The mechanism of PBOX-6-induced cell death was due to apoptosis, as indicated by the increased proportion of cells in the pre-G1 peak and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, intratumoural administration of PBOX-6 (7.5 mg/kg) significantly inhibited tumour growth in vivo in a mouse mammary carcinoma model (p=0.04, n=5, Student's t-test). Thus, PBOX-6 could be a promising anti-cancer agent for both hormone-dependent and -independent breast cancers.","['Greene, Lisa M', 'Fleeton, Marina', 'Mulligan, Jude', 'Gowda, Chikkanna', 'Sheahan, Brian J', 'Atkins, Gregory J', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Nacci, Vito', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Greene LM', 'Fleeton M', 'Mulligan J', 'Gowda C', 'Sheahan BJ', 'Atkins GJ', 'Campiani G', 'Nacci V', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*analysis/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2005 Nov;14(5):1357-63.,,"['0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signaling pathway for Fas-mediated apoptosis in various cells, including HL-60 cells, is currently unknown. Here, we studied the role of survival/apoptosis associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K)/Akt in this process. We found that both PI 3-K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, markedly suppressed phosphorylation of Akt and Bad in HL-60 cells. PI 3-K inhibitors significantly accelerated not only spontaneous apoptosis, but also Fas-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The pro-apoptotic effect of PI 3-K inhibitors favored Fas-mediated apoptosis rather than spontaneous apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The caspase-3 or -8 inhibitor reduced the pro-apoptotic effect of the PI 3-K inhibitors for Fas-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells, but the caspase-9 inhibitor did not. Although PI 3-K inhibitors did not affect Fas expression in HL-60 cells, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) levels were markedly reduced by PI 3-K inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide of c-FLIP confirmed that down-regulation of c-FLIP enhanced sensitization to Fas-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the PI 3-K/Akt signaling pathway may, in part, regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells through c-FLIP expression.","['Kondo, Gen', 'Iwase, Masayasu', 'Watanabe, Hitoshi', 'Uchida, Makiko', 'Takaoka, Sayaka', 'Ohashi, Masaru', 'Ito, Daisuke', 'Nagumo, Masao']","['Kondo G', 'Iwase M', 'Watanabe H', 'Uchida M', 'Takaoka S', 'Ohashi M', 'Ito D', 'Nagumo M']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Showa University School of Dentistry, 2-1-1 Kitasenzoku, Ota-ku, Tokyo 145-8515, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics/physiology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2005 Nov;14(5):1215-22.,,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA component of this structure, the telomeric repeats, undergo attrition with every cell division, as well as in response to endogenous events, like oxidative stress. Exposure to exogenous damage promotes this process and leads to growth arrest, apoptosis and eventually to malignant transformation. It was thought that the shortest chromosome ends in humans are the most susceptible ones to become dysfunctional telomeres, and have therefore an important role in cell death and cancer. Here, we show that a stable hierarchy exists in the form of a telomere length profile of the whole human karyotype. This rank order is conserved between different human cell types and individuals, is maintained throughout a lifetime, and seems to be genetically determined. As a particular feature, this telomere length profile differs only marginally when normal human cell cultures and malignant transformed cells are compared. The profile is moreover stable when these different human cells are exposed to mutagens such as bleomycin or mitomycin C. From these findings, the question arises if also the stably long telomeres have a basic biological function.","['Wick, U', 'Gebhart, E']","['Wick U', 'Gebhart E']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Bleomycin/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Mitomycin/toxicity', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Nucleic Acid Probes', 'Nucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects', 'Telomere/*drug effects/genetics']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijmm.16.5.951 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 Nov;16(5):951-7. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.16.5.951.,,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Probes)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was reported not to detect caveolin-1 in some cases, here we developed a sensitive method for the discriminative detection of caveolin-1, -2, and -3 by modified Western blotting. Caveolins were solubilized using a two-step procedure and detected by immunoprecipitation with a pAb to caveolins followed by Western blotting with mAbs specific to each caveolin. Using this method we detected caveolin-1beta, -2alpha and -2beta, but not caveolin-3 in the leukemia cell lines. Caveolin-1alpha, which was identified by pAb, was not detected by this method. We show here that caveolin-1alpha and -2alpha, but not caveolin-1beta and -2beta, are tyrosine phosphorylated. This modification is likely to cause the lack of reactivity of caveolin-1alpha to the mAb, and suggests a possible close relationship to cell activation.","['Tsuji, Yuichiro', 'Hatanaka, Michiyo', 'Maeda, Tamaki', 'Seya, Tsukasa', 'Takenaka, Hiroshi', 'Shimizu, Akira']","['Tsuji Y', 'Hatanaka M', 'Maeda T', 'Seya T', 'Takenaka H', 'Shimizu A']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Osaka Medical College, Daigakumachi, Takatsuki 569-8686, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 Nov;16(5):889-93.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two natural products have been shown to have similar activities in animal cells: the compounds are able to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells including those of colon, prostate, breast, and leukemia, suggesting the chemicals may potentially be a novel class of anti-cancer drugs. Since sodium salicylate can induce the heat shock response in animals, we examined the effects of jasmonates on the heat shock response in C6 glioma cells. Here, we show that brief exposure to methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but not to jasmonic acid, induces heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), but not HSP73 and HSP90, via heat shock factor I (HSF1) activation in C6 glioma cells without affecting cell viability. Intracellular H2O2 and O2-, and mitochondrial ROS were prominently increased in response to 5 mM MeJA in C6 cells. MeJA-induced HSP72 expression, HSF1 DNA binding, and human HSP70 promoter-driven CAT activity were prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (a general antioxidant), catalase (a specific antioxidant for H2O2), and sodium formate (an inhibitor of OH.), but not by Rac1 dominant negative mutant Rac1N17 and diphenyleneiodonium (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor), indicating that MeJA induces HSP72 expression though HSF1 that is activated via Rac1-NADPH oxidase-independent ROS production pathway. These results suggest that the plant stress hormones share the ability to induce heat shock response in animal cells.","['Oh, Su Young', 'Kim, Ji Hye', 'Park, Min Jung', 'Kim, Sun Mi', 'Yoon, Chang Shin', 'Joo, Young Mi', 'Park, Jang Su', 'Han, Song Iy', 'Park, Hye Gyeong', 'Kang, Ho Sung']","['Oh SY', 'Kim JH', 'Park MJ', 'Kim SM', 'Yoon CS', 'Joo YM', 'Park JS', 'Han SI', 'Park HG', 'Kang HS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Pusan 609-735, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Acetates/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oxylipins', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 Nov;16(5):833-9.,,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hsf1 protein, rat)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe the protein breakpoint cluster region, Bcr, as a negative regulator of this pathway. Bcr can form a complex with beta-catenin and negatively regulate expression of c-Myc. Knockdown of Bcr by short interfering RNA relieves the block and activates expression of c-Myc. Expression of Bcr in the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116, which has a high level of endogenous beta-catenin, leads to reduced c-Myc expression. The negative effect is exerted by the amino terminus of Bcr, which does not harbour the kinase domain. Bcr-Abl, the oncogene protein expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), does not bind to beta-catenin. It phosphorylates Bcr in the first exon sequence on tyrosines, which abrogates the binding of Bcr to beta-catenin. The inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, STI-571 or Gleevec, a drug against CML, reverses this effect. Our data contribute to the understanding of Bcr as a tumour suppressor in the Wnt signalling pathway, as well as in CML.","['Ress, Angelika', 'Moelling, Karin']","['Ress A', 'Moelling K']","['Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Gloriastrasse 30, 8006 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, myc/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/10/08 09:00,2006/09/21 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['7400536 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.embor.7400536 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2005 Nov;6(11):1095-100. doi: 10.1038/sj.embor.7400536.

One approach to addressing this problem is identifying agents that display antineoplastic properties concomitant with their immunosuppressive effects. METHODS: We examined the neoplasms among 1008 renal transplant recipients treated at a single center with sirolimus-cyclosporine +/- prednisone. RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory data, including 62.3+/-26.1 months follow-up (range 27.1-131), revealed 36 tumors in 35 patients (3.6%) presenting at 32.5+/-29.8 months. The 2.4% incidence of skin tumors, the most common neoplasms, was 1.58-fold greater than the general U.S. population. In addition to a 0.4% incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and a 0.2% incidence of renal cell carcinomas, we observed single cases of breast, bladder, endometrial, lung, and brain neoplasms as well as leukemia. The mean trough drug concentrations at the time of diagnosis in affected recipients were within our putative target ranges. In addition to eleven graft losses due to death with a functioning kidney, two were related to chronic rejection following reduced immunosuppression, and one, therapeutic nephrectomy for PTLD. Five of twelve deaths were caused by malignancies; four others among 1008 patients over the entire follow-up were attributed to cardiovascular events; one, to respiratory failure; and two, at distant locations to unknown causes. CONCLUSIONS: The sirolimus-cyclosporine +/- prednisone combination appears likely to be associated with a reduced incidence of tumors.","['Kahan, Barry D', 'Yakupoglu, Yarkin K', 'Schoenberg, Linda', 'Knight, Richard J', 'Katz, Stephen M', 'Lai, Deijan', 'Van Buren, Charles T']","['Kahan BD', 'Yakupoglu YK', 'Schoenberg L', 'Knight RJ', 'Katz SM', 'Lai D', 'Van Buren CT']","['The University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Division of Immunology and Organ Transplantation, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

The diagnosis of LPL/WM, however, remains a challenge in daily practice. Distinguishing LPL/WM from other B-cell lymphomas, especially marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, which share overlapping morphologic features, is difficult. The traditional practice of separating LPL/WM from other lymphomas by an arbitrary level of serum IgM is no longer considered valid. The characteristic immunophenotype described for LPL/WM by the WHO classification, that is, CD5(-)CD10(-)CD23-, is observed in 60-80% of neoplasms, but variations from this pattern of antigen expression are common, with CD23 being detected in up to 40% of cases. Lack of a distinct molecular genetic hallmark complicates the distinction of LPL/WM from other B-cell lymphomas. Although the t(9;14) is stated to be present in 50% of cases in the WHO classification, translocations involving the Ig heavy chain including the t(9;14) are actually rare in LPL/WM. Deletion of 6q21-q23, a nonspecific finding, is the most common aberration reported in 40-70% of patients. At the molecular level, the neoplastic clone in most cases has undergone Ig variable gene mutation, but not isotype switching, and the clone retains the capability of plasmacytic differentiation. Currently, the diagnosis of LPL/WM can only be established by incorporating clinical and pathologic findings and excluding alternative diagnoses. In some cases, in our opinion, distinguishing LPL/WM from marginal zone B-cell lymphomas seems arbitrary using currently recommended criteria.","['Lin, Pei', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Lin P', 'Medeiros LJ']","['From the Department of Hematopathology, UTMD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Anat Pathol,Advances in anatomic pathology,9435676,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology', 'Paraproteins/metabolism', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['00125480-200509000-00002 [pii]', '10.1097/01.pap.0000184176.65919.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Anat Pathol. 2005 Sep;12(5):246-55. doi: 10.1097/01.pap.0000184176.65919.17.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Paraproteins)']",,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra revealed that hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals were generated in the culture medium after exposure to radiation or H(2)O(2). Initial accumulation of DNA fragments at 2 h after exposure was delayed in irradiated cells compared with H(2)O(2)-treated cells, although formation of abasic sites immediately after exposure was significantly higher in irradiated cells and similar quantities of hydroxyl radicals were produced under both conditions. Activity assay of caspases revealed that caspase-3, -8 and -9 were activated 2 h after exposure to H(2)O(2), whereas in irradiated cells caspase-3 and -9 activation occurred 4 h after exposure but increased caspase-8 activation was not observed. Release of cytochrome c into cytosol was seen at 2 h after radiation and H(2)O(2) treatment. Radiation did not affect proapoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid), whereas H (2)O(2) increased accumulation of Bax in the mitochondrial membrane 2 h to 6 h after treatment, independently of the truncation of Bid by activated caspase-8. Moreover, treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK increased cell survival and prevented accumulation of DNA fragments in H(2)O(2)-treated cells, but not in irradiated cells. These results suggest that, unlike the caspase cascade of H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis, cytochrome c and caspase-9 are important for the intrinsic pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis, independent of caspase-8.","['Hosokawa, Yoichiro', 'Sakakura, Yasunori', 'Tanaka, Likinobu', 'Okumura, Kazuhiko', 'Yajima, Toshihiko', 'Kaneko, Masayuki']","['Hosokawa Y', 'Sakakura Y', 'Tanaka L', 'Okumura K', 'Yajima T', 'Kaneko M']","['Department of Dental Radiology, School of Dentistry, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Japan. hosokawa@hoku-iryo-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*administration & dosage', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/radiation effects']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/46.293 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.46.293 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2005 Sep;46(3):293-303. doi: 10.1269/jrr.46.293.,,"['9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All mice that received BMT survived LCMV infection and developed a virus carrier status. Immunotherapy by adoptive transfer of naive splenocytes protected against low (200 PFU), but not high (2 x 10(6) PFU), doses of LCMV. Attempts to control infection of high viral titers using strongly elevated frequencies of activated LCMV-specific T cells failed to control virus and resulted in immunopathology and death. In contrast, virus neutralizing Abs combined with naive splenocytes were able to efficiently control high-dose LCMV infection without associated side effects. Thus, cell transfer combined with neutralizing Abs represented the most effective means of controlling BMT-associated opportunistic viral infection in our in vivo model.

Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) and its receptor, CXCR4, have been implicated as important regulators of a number of fetal and adult cell functions, including survival/antiapoptosis and migration/homing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We hypothesized that the SDF-1/CXCL12-CXCR4 axis would also be important for regulation of murine ESC functions. ESCs secreted low levels of SDF-1/CXCL12 and expressed low levels of CXCR4; however, both increased with differentiation of ESCs. Endogenously produced/released SDF-1/CXCL12 enhanced survival/antiapoptosis of ESCs in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor but absence of serum, and survival/antiapoptosis was further enhanced by exogenous administration of SDF-1/CXCL12. Furthermore, SDF-1/CXCL12 induced chemotaxis of ESCs, and chemotaxis could be enhanced by diprotin A inhibition of CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV. Endogenous and exogenous SDF-1/CXCL12 enhanced embryoid body production of primitive and definitive erythroid, granulocyte-macrophage, and multipotential progenitors. SDF-1/CXCL12 did not noticeably affect production of hemangioblasts.

The expression level of human CAT1 (hCAT1) mRNA in mononuclear cells (MNCs) fractionated according to lineage-selective markers was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The expression of CAT1 in glycophorin A-positive erythroid cells was 8 times higher than in nonfractionated MNC (control) cells. Characteristics of L-arginine uptake by K562 cells, an established leukemic cell line used as an erythroid model, were similar to those of CAT1 in regards to saturation kinetics, sodium independence, and substantial inhibition of L-arginine uptake by N-ethylmaleimide, which is a specific inhibitor of system y+ amino acid transporter. Removal of L-arginine from the culture medium prevented both proliferation and differentiation of K562 cells, while removal of L-lysine or L-histidine had little effect on differentiation, though proliferation was blocked. Hematopoietic stem cells obtained from human cord blood failed to develop into erythroid cells in the absence of L-arginine in the culture medium. These findings indicate that hCAT1 is involved in erythroid hematopoiesis through its role in importing L-arginine, which appears to be essential for the differentiation of red blood cells.","['Shima, Yoichiro', 'Maeda, Tomoji', 'Aizawa, Shin', 'Tsuboi, Isao', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Kato, Ryo', 'Tamai, Ikumi']","['Shima Y', 'Maeda T', 'Aizawa S', 'Tsuboi I', 'Kobayashi D', 'Kato R', 'Tamai I']","['Department of Molecular Biopharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamasaki, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan. tamai@rs.noda.tus.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Arginine/blood/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TRPV Cation Channels/blood/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/10/08 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)66384-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3166 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 15;107(4):1352-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3166.

Using the powerful zebrafish model for embryonic analysis, we compared the effects of either reducing or ablating Scl using morpholino-modified antisense RNAs. Ablation of Scl resulted in the loss of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, consistent with its essential role in these processes. Interestingly, in embryos with severely reduced Scl levels, erythroid progenitors expressing gata1 and embryonic globin developed. Erythroid maturation was deficient in these Scl hypomorphs, supporting that Scl was required both for the erythroid specification and for the maturation steps, with maturation requiring higher Scl levels than specification. Although all hematopoietic functions were rescued by wild-type Scl mRNA, an Scl DNA binding mutant rescued primitive and definitive hematopoiesis but did not rescue primitive erythroid maturation. Together, we showed that there is a distinct Scl hypomorphic phenotype and demonstrated that distinct functions are required for the roles of Scl in the specification and differentiation of primitive and definitive hematopoietic lineages. Our results revealed that Scl participates in multiple processes requiring different levels and functions. Further, we identified an Scl hypomorphic phenotype distinct from the null state.","['Juarez, Marianne A', 'Su, Fengyun', 'Chun, Sang', 'Kiel, Mark J', 'Lyons, Susan E']","['Juarez MA', 'Su F', 'Chun S', 'Kiel MJ', 'Lyons SE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology and Cellular and Molecular Biology Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA/chemistry', 'RNA, Antisense/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",2005/10/08 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)58976-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M507998200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 16;280(50):41636-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M507998200.

These provide a powerful rationale for using azanucleosides (and other small molecules being developed for DNA demethylation) as a novel means of pharmacologic targeting of cancer cells that is distinct from low-dose chemotherapy. Encouraging response rates of about 50% in myelodysplasia with 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine or DAC) have resulted in a number of phase III studies being initiated in this disorder. The development of such drugs for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is ongoing. While the specificity of DNA demethylation has been delineated by studying distinct genes or sets of genes, and proof-of-principle studies of in vivo methylation report demethylation and reactivation of genes like p15/INK4b and gamma-globin, responses to demethylating agents may be more complex. Specifically, so-called cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are intriguing targets for demethylation, since they are silenced in many hematopoietic disorders and may be reactivated by epigenetic therapy.

Decitabine, a cytosine analogue, is cytotoxic at high doses but has selective DNA demethylating activity at low doses. The focus of current decitabine investigations is twofold: to elucidate all of the mechanisms of action and to determine the optimal dose, schedule, and concomitant therapies. New phase I trials have identified a ""biologically effective dose,"" which is 1 to 2 logs lower than the cytotoxic dose. A clinical development program with low-dose decitabine in malignant diseases is focused on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A phase III trial in MDS showed objective responses (complete [CR] plus partial [PR] remission) and longer median time to progression to AML or death with decitabine than with supportive care alone. The optimal use of decitabine may be in combination with other agents that promote gene expression, namely, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.

Since the event is reversible, it is an interesting target for intervention with specific inhibitors of DNA methylation, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR, decitabine). 5-AZA-CdR is a prodrug that requires activation via phosphorylation by deoxcytidine kinase. The nucleotide analog is incorporated into DNA, where it produces an irreversible inactivation of DNA methyltransferase. 5-AZA-CdR is an S-phase-specific agent. The demethylation of DNA by this analog in neoplastic cells can lead to the reactivation of silent tumor-suppressor genes, induction of differentiation or senescence, growth inhibition, and loss of clonogenicity. 5-AZA-CdR was demonstrated to be a potent antineoplastic agent against leukemia and tumors in animal models. Preliminary clinical trials of 5-AZA-CdR using different dose-schedules have shown interesting antineoplastic activity in patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that 5-AZA-CdR has a short in vivo half-life of 15 to 25 minutes. The major toxicity produced by this analog is granulocytopenia. To exploit the full chemotherapeutic potential of 5-AZA-CdR for the treatment of cancer, its optimal dose-schedule has to be found.

The proper application of the unique properties of decitabine took quite some time to elucidate. In addition, the practical handling in the clinic was not easy as the prolonged myelosuppression of decitabine made it difficult to determine the preferred dose and schedule. Laboratory studies on DNA methylation and cell differentiation showed possible applications in solid and hematologic malignancies. However, despite many attempts, results in solid tumors have been disappointing thus far. After thorough investigation, decitabine achieved therapeutic application in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in particular in patients with a poor prognosis. Further indications may include acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia. Whereas most drugs are already at the end of their life cycle after 40 years, decitabine is only at the beginning.

However, well-documented families exist with first-degree relatives acquiring one or several MPDs. It is reasonable to assume that the germ-line mutation(s) or genetic background must facilitate or predispose for one or several somatic mutation(s) that lead to the MPD that is indistinguishable from the sporadic form. This is best documented in familial polycythemia vera (PV), which appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance. However, there are also families wherein members develop any combination of MPDs, including PV, essential thrombocythemia (ET), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). A separate group of familial diseases is the familial thrombocythemias, wherein germ-line mutations in the genes for thrombopoietin or its receptor, MPL, cause polyclonal hereditary thrombocythemia, which may be clinically indistinguishable from ET. Patients with the congenital polycythemic condition ""primary familial and congenital polycythemia"" (PFCP) have characteristically decreased erythropoietin (Epo) levels similar to PV, hypersensitive erythroid progenitors, and low Epo levels; as such, this condition is often confused with PV. Therefore, PFCP will also be discussed here, while other congenital polycythemic states such as the Chuvash polycythemia that have elevated or inappropriately normal Epo levels will be omitted from this review in view of their distinct phenotype and unique laboratory features.","['Skoda, Radek', 'Prchal, Josef T']","['Skoda R', 'Prchal JT']","['Department of Research, Experimental Hematology, University of Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, 4031 Basel, Switzerland. radek.skoda@unibas.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(05)00144-7 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2005.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2005 Oct;42(4):266-73. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2005.08.002.,,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of ET is characterized by an increased incidence of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and an inherent tendency to progress into myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There is concern about undesirable effects of cytoreductive therapy given to prevent vascular events, particularly the risk of accelerating the rate of hematologic transformation. Thus, management involves modification of reversible vascular risk factors and further stratification according to the thrombotic risk. Myelosuppressive agents are not recommended in low-risk patients, whereas controlled studies support the therapeutic value of hydroxyurea (HU) plus aspirin in high-risk cases.

First described in 1892, the cause of the disease remains unknown and no potentially curative therapy other than bone marrow transplantation is currently available. It is commonly held that PV is a rare disorder, when in fact with a minimum incidence of 2.6 per 100,000 it is more common than chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is particularly prevalent in persons of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. However, the incidence of PV is not as high as that of erythrocytosis from other causes collectively, which poses a problem in differential diagnosis when PV presents as isolated erythrocytosis. Characteristic features of PV are erythropoietin (Epo)-independent in vitro erythroid colony formation, as well as hypersensitivity to many other hematopoietic growth factors. Recently, a remarkable association between PV and a somatic point mutation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F) was described. Functional assays have revealed that JAK2 V617F is capable of inducing constitutive STAT5-mediated signaling in vitro, as well as erythrocytosis in vivo in mice. These data suggest that the JAK2 V617F mutation participates in the pathogenesis of PV. In current clinical practice, two different clinical approaches have been used to diagnose PV. One approach requires establishing the presence of absolute erythrocytosis by directly determining the red cell mass (RCM). A second approach utilizes a RCM-independent diagnostic algorithm based on the serum Epo level and bone marrow histology. Screening for JAK2 V617F can now be added to both diagnostic algorithms. However, it is very clear that some patients with classical PV lack the JAK2 V617F mutation, while some patients with other chronic myeloproliferative disorders such as idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) and essential thrombocytosis (ET) also express the JAK2 V617F mutation. Therefore, by necessity, any discussion of PV must take into consideration these companion myeloproliferative disorders, and since erythrocytosis is the single clinical feature that sets PV apart from IMF and ET, it is clear that the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation cannot by itself establish a diagnosis of PV. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy for PV. In addition, both aspirin and cytoreductive therapy have been employed to control thrombocytosis and in the case of the latter, leukocytosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis as well. Despite recent progress in the field, several important issues remain controversial. In this review, we will present the areas of agreement, but also point out where the authors' personal viewpoints differ.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Spivak, Jerry L']","['Tefferi A', 'Spivak JL']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', '*Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(05)00145-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2005.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2005 Oct;42(4):206-20. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2005.08.003.,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key genetic alterations and new oncogenic pathways have been identified. Molecular genetic aberrations in thyroid carcinomas bear noteworthy resemblance to those in acute myelogenous leukemias. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias both possess transcription factor gene rearrangements-PPARgamma-related translocations in thyroid carcinoma and RARalpha-related and CBF-related translocations (amongst others) in myeloid leukemia. PPARgamma and RARalpha are closely related members ofthe same nuclear receptor subfamily, and the PML-RARalpha and PAX8-PPARgamma fusion proteins both function as dominant negative inhibitors of their wild-type parent proteins. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias also both harbor NRAS mutations (15-25% of both cancers) and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations--RET mutations in thyroid carcinomas and FLT3 mutations in myeloid leukemias. The NRAS and tyrosine receptor kinase mutations are not observed in the same thyroid carcinoma or leukemia patients, suggesting that multiple initiating pathways exist in both. Lastly, thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias possess p53 mutations at relatively low frequency (10-15%) in patients who tend to be older and have more aggressive, therapy resistant disease. Such parallels are unlikely to occur by chance alone and argue that common mechanisms underlie these diverse epithelial and hematologic cancers. The comparison of thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias may highlight areas of thyroid cancer investigation worthy of further focus. For example, few collaborating mutations have been defined in thyroid carcinomas even though they play a clear role in myeloid leukemias, as exemplified by RARalpha rearrangements and FLT3 mutations that together dictate the promyleocytic leukemia phenotype. Functional interactions between collaborating mutations are possible at multiple levels, and it is tempting to speculate that some thyroid carcinomas might develop through an unique combination or co-activation of RET and RAS and/or RET and PPARgamma (and/or other) signaling systems. In fact, the ELE1-RET (PTC3) fusion protein contains the ELE1 nuclear receptor co-activator domain and it appears to physically associate with and inhibit wild-type PPARgamma in some papillary carcinomas. The similarities of the fusion proteins in thyroid carcinoma and myeloid leukemia suggest that a more directed search for fusion genes in non-thyroid carcinomas is warranted. In fact, novel fusion genes have been identified recently in aggressive midline, secretory breast, and renal cell carcinomas, although the epithelial nature of the latter is not well-documented. Interestingly, these cancers all tend to present more frequently in adolescence and young adulthood in a manner similar to thyroid and myeloid malignancies that have fusion genes. The analyses of cancers that present earlier in life may enhance fusion gene recognition in other carcinoma types. Definition and biologic characterization of the precursor cells that give rise to thyroid carcinoma will also be important. Myeloid leukemias are thought to arise from stem/progenitor cells that acquire disturbed self-renewal and differentiation capacities but retain characteristics of the myeloid lineages. Although the presence of comparable stem/progenitor cells in the thyroid are not defined, distinct thyroid cancer lineages and patterns of differentiation exist and candidate stem/progenitor cells such as the p63-immunoreactive solid cell nests are apparent. A last important area is development of molecular-based therapies for thyroid carcinoma patients resistant to standard radio-iodine treatment. Treatments for such cancers are limited and pathways defined by thyroid cancer mutations are prime targets for pharmacologic interventions with molecular inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and nuclear receptor ligands have proven dramatically effective in some myeloid leukemia patients. Various molecular inhibitors are being investigated now in thyroid cancer models. Such developments predict that the thyroid cancer model will continue to provide biologic insights into human carcinoma biology and that improved pathologic diagnosis and treatment for thyroid cancer patients sit on the not too distant horizon.","['Kroll, Todd G']",['Kroll TG'],"['Department of Pathology, Endocrinology Division, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Molecular Biology', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/1-4020-8107-3_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2004;122:85-105. doi: 10.1007/1-4020-8107-3_4.,,"['0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",,249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Private supplies are not subject to the regulations and management requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Amendments to the SDWA recently lowered the standard for arsenic from 50 to 10 ppb in public water supplies (effective in 2006). Churchill County, Nevada, has approximately 25,000 residents. Slightly more than half (13,500) rely on private domestic wells for water supply. Ample data and media publicity about high arsenic concentrations in water supplies and a federally led investigation of a leukaemia cluster suggested that residents of the county would be aware that arsenic concentrations in private wells were highly likely to exceed the 10 ppb standard. A survey carried out in 2002 showed that a majority of respondents (72%) consumed water from private wells and among them a minority (38%) applied treatment. Maximum, median and minimum concentrations of arsenic from all samples (n = 351) were 2,100, 26 and < 3 ppb, respectively. Seventy-four per cent of all samples exceeded 10 ppb. A majority (87%) of those who applied treatment consumed tap water. The relatively low rate of application of treatment suggested that these rural residents did not recognize that consumption could have associated health risks. However, those who applied treatment were approximately 0.3 times as likely to be consuming water with > 10 ppb arsenic than those who consumed water that was not treated. In areas where concentrations of arsenic have been demonstrated to be high, it may be important to conduct a focused educational effort for private well owners to ensure that they take the steps needed to assess and reduce risks associated with contaminants found in tap water, including arsenic. An educational effort could include promoting sampling efforts to determine the magnitude of arsenic concentrations, explaining the risk associated with arsenic consumption and providing information about choices for home treatment systems that are likely to be effective in removing arsenic. This may be especially important in rural areas where adverse health effects are not evident to local populations.","['Walker, Mark', 'Benson, Marnee', 'Shaw, W Douglass']","['Walker M', 'Benson M', 'Shaw WD']","['Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, MS 370, FA 132, University of Nevada, 1664 N Virginia Street, Reno, NV 89557-0013, USA. mwalker@cabnr.unr.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Water Health,Journal of water and health,101185420,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arsenic/*analysis', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nevada', 'Private Sector', '*Rural Population', 'Water Microbiology', 'Water Pollution, Chemical/*analysis', 'Water Supply/*analysis']",2005/10/08 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/10/08 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2166/wh.2005.044 [doi]'],ppublish,J Water Health. 2005 Sep;3(3):305-12. doi: 10.2166/wh.2005.044.,,['N712M78A8G (Arsenic)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines the operating characteristics of the DT in patients about to undergo bone marrow transplant (BMT). Patients (N=491) completed the DT, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Version (STAI-S), the ECOG Performance Status Scale, and the Patient Problem List. DT scores were related to higher depression, higher anxiety, and poorer performance status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of DT scores yielded area under the curve estimates of 0.75 when compared to the CES-D cutoff score of 16, suggesting the DT has acceptable overall accuracy. The DT cutoff score of 4 had the greatest sensitivity and specificity when compared to the CES-D cutoff score. Patients above this cutoff score reported worse ECOG scores and more practical, family, emotional, and physical problems (all p's< or =0.05) than those below the cutoff. The findings suggest the DT is a useful tool for screening for distress in BMT patients. The optimal DT cutoff score of 4 found here was identical to that found in another study using different criteria. This cutoff score also identified patients with problems likely to reflect psychological distress.","['Ransom, Sean', 'Jacobsen, Paul B', 'Booth-Jones, Margaret']","['Ransom S', 'Jacobsen PB', 'Booth-Jones M']","['University of South Florida, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/psychology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/psychology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychometrics/statistics & numerical data', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Sick Role', '*Sickness Impact Profile']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.993 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2006 Jul;15(7):604-12. doi: 10.1002/pon.993.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on their wide host range and ability to transduce quiescent cells, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived lentivirus vectors are ideally suited for this purpose. Our present studies in a murine model show that whole bone marrow cells are readily transduced after a 1-hour vector exposure in the presence of stem cell factor and CH296 fibronectin fragment. Using this rapid transduction protocol, we achieved long-term, multilineage reconstitution of murine recipients with up to 25% GFP-expressing cells in primary and secondary recipients.

Vectors destined for clinical evaluation have been rendered multiply defective by deletion of all viral coding sequences and nonessential cis-acting sequences from the transfer genome. The viral envelope and accessory proteins are excluded from the production system. The vectors are produced from separate expression plasmids that are designed to minimize the potential for homologous recombination. These features ensure that the regeneration of the starting virus is impossible. It is a regulatory requirement to confirm the absence of any replication competent virus, so we describe here the development and validation of a replication competent lentivirus (RCL) assay for equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV)-based vectors. The assay is based on the guidelines developed for testing retroviral vectors, and uses the F-PERT (fluorescent-product enhanced reverse transcriptase) assay to test for the presence of a transmissible reverse transcriptase. We have empirically modelled the replication kinetics of an EIAV-like entity in human cells and devised an amplification protocol by comparison with a replication competent MLV. The RCL assay has been validated at the 20 litre manufacturing scale, during which no RCL was detected. The assay is theoretically applicable to any lentiviral vector and pseudotype combination.","['Miskin, J', 'Chipchase, D', 'Rohll, J', 'Beard, G', 'Wardell, T', 'Angell, D', 'Roehl, H', 'Jolly, D', 'Kingsman, S', 'Mitrophanous, K']","['Miskin J', 'Chipchase D', 'Rohll J', 'Beard G', 'Wardell T', 'Angell D', 'Roehl H', 'Jolly D', 'Kingsman S', 'Mitrophanous K']","['Oxford BioMedica (UK) Ltd, Medawar Centre, The Oxford Science Park, Oxford, UK. j.miskin@oxfordbiomedica.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/*genetics', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['3302666 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.gt.3302666 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2006 Feb;13(3):196-205. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302666.,,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study characterizes the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of A3D8 in NB4 cells. We show that A3D8 induces activation of both initiator caspase-8 and -9 and effector caspase-3 and -7 but only inhibition of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 reduces A3D8-induced apoptosis. Moreover, A3D8 induces mitochondrial alterations (decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential DeltaPsi m and cytochrome c release), which are reduced by caspase-8 inhibitor, suggesting that caspase-8 is primarily involved in A3D8-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells. However, the apoptotic process is independent of TNF-family death receptor signalling. Interestingly, the general serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) decreases A3D8-induced apoptosis and when combined with general caspase inhibitor displays an additive effect resulting in complete prevention of apoptosis. These results suggest that both caspase-dependent and serine protease-dependent pathways contribute to A3D8-induced apoptosis. Finally, A3D8 induces apoptosis in all-trans-retinoic acid-resistant NB4-derived cells and in APL primary blasts, characterizing the A3D8 anti-CD44 mAb as a novel class of apoptosis-inducing agent in APL.","['Maquarre, E', 'Artus, C', 'Gadhoum, Z', 'Jasmin, C', 'Smadja-Joffe, F', 'Robert-Lezenes, J']","['Maquarre E', 'Artus C', 'Gadhoum Z', 'Jasmin C', 'Smadja-Joffe F', 'Robert-Lezenes J']","['INSERM U602, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403944 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403944 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2296-303. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403944.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher percentages of CD38-expressing CLL B cells may be found in lymphoid compartments compared to peripheral blood. Therefore, it is possible that although CLL B cells are resting, CD38 may be a marker of recent cell activation prior to entry into the periphery. To address this hypothesis, we examined the association of CD38 expression with other activation antigens identified in gene expression profiling experiments and include CD18, CD49d, CD20, and subunit 5 of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. We found that all these markers were more highly expressed in leukemic B cells from CD38-positive CLL patients. Lastly, because interferon is known to modulate CD38 expression, we used IFN-alpha to test the ability of CLL B cells to increase CD38 expression in vitro. Interestingly, IFN stimulation only modulated CD38 expression in CLL B cells that already expressed CD38. Taken together, these data suggest that CD38 is a marker of a more recently activated CLL B cell. This in turn may explain the biological and clinical differences between CD38-positive type B-CLL and CD38-negative type B-CLL.","['Pittner, B T', 'Shanafelt, T D', 'Kay, N E', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Pittner BT', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology and Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Graduate School, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403975 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403975 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2264-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403975.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,"['R01 CA91942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL67742/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):523-5; author reply 528-9.

Moreover, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silent Runx2 in myeloma cells, we suppressed OPN mRNA and protein expression. OPN production in myeloma cells was stimulated by growth factors as IL-6 and IFG-1 and in turn OPN stimulated myeloma cell proliferation. In an 'in vitro' angiogenesis system we showed that OPN production by myeloma cells is critical for the proangiogenic effect of myeloma cells. The expression of OPN by purified bone marrow (BM) CD138(+) cells has also been investigated in 60 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients, finding that 40% of MM patients tested expressed OPN.

Unlike starvation, in which fat stores from adipose are depleted and protein is spared from skeletal muscle, neither fat nor protein is spared in cachexia. Cachexia affects nearly half of cancer patients, causing the clinical manifestations of anorexia, muscle wasting, weight loss, early satiety, fatigue, and impaired immune response. Cachexia does not only impede the response to chemotherapy but also is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. According to clinical studies, increasing caloric intake does not necessarily reverse cachexia. The pathophysiology of cachexia involves more complex mechanisms than simply caloric deficiency. The process appears to be mediated by circulating catabolic factors, either secreted by the tumor alone or in concert with host-derived factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins (IL-1 and IL-6), interferon (IFN-y), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The successful reversal of this process will require in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms involved, which will then enable the development of effective pharmacologic interventions that may not only improve quality of life, but more importantly, improve survival among cancer patients.","['Esper, Dema Halasa', 'Harb, Wael A']","['Esper DH', 'Harb WA']","['Horizon Oncology, Lafayette, Indiana, USA. dhalasa_esper@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nutr Clin Pract,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,8606733,IM,"['Anorexia/etiology', 'Cachexia/etiology/metabolism/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Energy Intake/physiology', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality', 'Quality of Life']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['20/4/369 [pii]', '10.1177/0115426505020004369 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutr Clin Pract. 2005 Aug;20(4):369-76. doi: 10.1177/0115426505020004369.,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still, whether telomeric proteins respond to retinoid treatment is not clear. If they do, how they would respond and how they would interfere in telomerase regulation during differentiation are also unclear. Using all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-sensitive and -resistant APL cell lines NB4, NB4-R1, and NB4-R2, we analyzed a panel of telomeric proteins, including TRF1, PINX1, TANK1, and TANK2, at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels during the differentiation of these cell lines in the 2 pathways. Our analyses showed that both mRNA and protein expression of TRF1 remained stable during NB4 and NB4-R1 cell differentiation but slightly increased in NB4-R2 cells, suggesting that TRF1 may have different functions in the RAR3- and RXR3-dependent pathways. The stable expression of TRF1 may be because telomere length remains unchanged. Pinx1 mRNA expression was tightly correlated with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA expression during differentiation. Variation in Pinx1 expression may be a reaction induced by hTERT expression variation. TANK1 mRNA expression and TANK1 protein levels were both down-regulated in all 3 APL cell lines at a later period of differentiation, suggesting that TANK1 may positively regulate telomerase activity and that both RAR3- and RXR3-dependent pathways may exert this regulation.TANK2 expression levels remained stable in all 3 APL cell lines during differentiation, showing that TANK2 may have little effect on telomerase. Thus, our studies provide an outline of the dynamics of telomeric protein expression and the probable regulatory effects of these proteins on telomerase during the differentiation of ATRA-responsive and -resistant APL cells.","['Sun, Jie', 'Huang, He', 'Zhu, Yuanyuan', 'Lan, Jianping', 'Li, Jingyuan', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Yu, Jian']","['Sun J', 'Huang H', 'Zhu Y', 'Lan J', 'Li J', 'Lai X', 'Yu J']","['Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Tankyrases/*biosynthesis', 'Telomerase/*biosynthesis', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/*biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['4N7XJPB47BQ9T93K [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.A10420 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Oct;82(3):215-23. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.A10420.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (PINX1 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Tankyrases)', 'EC 2.4.4.30 (TNKS protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation between genetic polymorphism of A870G of CCND1 and clinical outcome among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been reported. However, the effect on ALL occurrence remains unclear. To examine the genotypic frequency of CCND1 polymorphism, we performed a case-control study in a Chinese population of 183 children with ALL and 190 healthy controls. The genetic frequency of CCND1 had a significant overall correlation in patients and controls. The AA genotype of CCND1 showed a tendency to increase ALL risk 3.2898-fold compared with the AG + GG genotype (P = .0207). Stratification of patients according to cell type, risk level, and chemotherapeutic response showed significance for the AA genotype in T-cell ALL, ALL with high risk, and no complete remission (P = .047, P = .011, and P = .007, respectively).

These investigations showed that AML is not a homogeneous disease but a heterogeneous group of biologically different subentities. These subentities are currently primarily defined by cytogenetics by which three main subgroups can be discriminated: AML with balanced translocations, AML with unbalanced aberrations and AML without cytogenetically detectable aberrations. Within the latter group molecular alterations are identified in more than half of cases such as NPM mutations, FLT3 mutations, MLL duplications and mutations of CEBP-alpha. The clinical meaning of these findings is illustrated by substantial differences in response to therapy and long-term outcome. As demonstrated by the recent multicenter trial of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG) and other studies intensification of induction therapy may improve the results in distinct subtypes but fails to do so in others. Therefore, new strategies need to be explored which incorporate the knowledge about the biology of AML to develop biology adapted treatment strategies. This process has just begun and is predominantly determined by the availability of new agents and their evaluation in clinical phase I and II studies. A variety of targets are currently explored and some trials have yielded promising results already.

In this latter case, the clone with deletion of the derivative chromosome 9 comprised 21.1% at diagnosis, increasing to 36.8% after 11 months, suggesting a growth advantage.

CNS fungal infections may present as a mass (i.e., brain abscess) typically in the course of aspergillosis or zygomycosis, or may primarily involve the meninges (i.e., meningitis), as can be observed in patients with candidiasis or cryptococcosis. Most commonly, fungal brain abscesses are due to aspergillosis. CNS aspergillosis is observed particularly in acute leukemia and allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. Usually, aspergillosis is localized in the lungs and secondarily spreads to the brain; only in few cases does it develop as solitary localization of CNS. In these conditions, diagnosis is very difficult because signs and symptoms can be completely aspecific. Diagnosis can often be performed only through aggressive procedures (i.e., stereotactic puncture). Zygomycetes are the second most frequent cause of brain abscesses. CNS involvement is higher than in the course of invasive aspergillosis, and this fungal complication is also characterized by a high mortality rate. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that only posaconazole and lipid formulations of amphotericin B present some possibility of success in the treatment of zygomycosis, but the pharmacologic approach should always be associated with surgery. Among molds, other agents (i.e., Fusarium and Scedosporium) may also be responsible for fungal abscess. More rarely during the course of a hematologic malignancy, a meningeal candidiasis or cryptococcosis may be observed. This review mainly focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management strategies of all cases of CNS fungal infections in hematologic patients.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Caira, Morena', 'Falcucci, Paolo', 'Fianchi, Luana']","['Pagano L', 'Caira M', 'Falcucci P', 'Fianchi L']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica S.

A total of 19.8x10(6) CD34+ cells/kg were collected with a single apheresis session. At 37 weeks, she delivered a viable female infant weighing 3 lbs 12 oz. Fetal abnormalities included acrocyanosis, shallow sacral dimple, short digits and limbs, and prominent frontal skull with mild macrognathia. A postnatal echocardiogram revealed a moderate-sized membranous ventricular septal defect. The ventricular septal defect proved significant and required surgical repair at 5 months. Approximately 4 weeks after delivery, the mother underwent autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately, 100 days after transplantation, she had a relapse of AML.

METHODS: The charts of 51 children who underwent treatment for both cancer and ICH between January 1985 and January 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Assessment tools included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and the Fisher exact and Student t-tests. Among the 51 cases, 30 involved brain tumors, 19 leukemia, and two lymphoma. The treatment group (Group 1) comprised 36 patients who suffered ICH during cancer treatment; the posttreatment group (Group 2) consisted of the 15 patients who suffered ICH after the completion of cancer treatment. The types of ICH included 22 cortical, four subcortical, 17 subdural, five brainstem, one subarachnoid, one epidural, and one ventricular. Thrombocytopenia was present in nine patients (25%) in Group 1. More patients in Group 2 (87%) than in Group 1 (44%) underwent cranial radiation treatment. Patients in Group 1 experienced a higher incidence of coagulopathy (37%) and ICH-related death (25%) than those in Group 2 (0 and 7%, respectively). Decrease in KPS and GCS scores of greater than 30 and greater than 3, respectively, at the time of ICH were indicators of increased mortality. Of the 17 children with subdural ICH, 13 suffered the hemorrhage following treatment for hydrocephalus and three patients suffered ICH associated with thrombocytopenia. In the 33 children alive at the 3-month follow-up examination after the ICH, no difference existed in the mean KPS scores pre- and post-ICH. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for hydrocephalus, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage into the tumor were the most probable causes of ICH among patients in Group 1. Radiation-induced vasculopathy was a possible cause of ICH in the patients in Group 2. Significant decline in the patient's neurological status at the time of ICH is a poor prognostic factor, but those patients who survive cancer and ICH are likely to regain neurological function.","['Kyrnetskiy, Evgeny E', 'Kun, Larry E', 'Boop, Frederick A', 'Sanford, Robert A', 'Khan, Raja B']","['Kyrnetskiy EE', 'Kun LE', 'Boop FA', 'Sanford RA', 'Khan RB']","[""Department of Radiological Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/complications', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/*etiology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Humans', 'Hydrocephalus/complications', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/10/07 09:00,2005/10/20 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/ped.2005.102.1.0031 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2005 Jan;102(1 Suppl):31-5. doi: 10.3171/ped.2005.102.1.0031.,,,,,,,,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with myeloid leukemia underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The donors of twelve patients (study group) were given G-CSF 250 microg/d for seven days prior to harvesting. The marrow cell composition, the outcome of subsequent engraftment and the occurrence of aGVHD were compared with those in twelve patients without G-CSF (control group). RESULTS: The bone marrow stimulated by G-CSF yielded higher number of nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, CFU-GM and CFU-MK (P < 0.01). The number of T lymphocyte subsets in the graft stimulated with G-CSF was different from that in the control group. The number of CD4+ cells was decreased and that of CD8+ increased. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was reduced markedly (P < 0.01). The change of CD34+, CD4+, CD8+ percentage and CFU-GM, CFU-MK proliferation in donor bone marrow with and without G-CSF was compared. The same characteristic change as above graft was observed. Hemopoietic reconstitution in the study group after allo-BMT was accelerated. In the study group the days of granulocyte count exceeding 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet count exceeding 20 x 10(9)/L were 16 days (range 11 - 23 days) and 17 days (range 14 - 25 days) (in the control group 20.5 day, range 14 - 29 days and 23 days, range 17 - 32 days P < 0.05). Grade II - IV aGVHD did not occur in patients of the study group but in 3 patients of the control group. CONCLUSION: The bone marrow harvested from donor with G-CSF stimulation can accelerate hemopoietic recovery and decrease the incidence of severe aGVHD. The accelerated hematopoietic recovery is associated with increased number of CD34+, CFU-GM and CFU-MK in the graft.","['Ji, S', 'Chen, H', 'Wang, H', 'Yan, H', 'Pan, S']","['Ji S', 'Chen H', 'Wang H', 'Yan H', 'Pan S']","['Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Air Force PLA, Beijing 100036, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/10/07 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2005/10/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2001 Dec;40(12):834-7.,,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The parameters of coagulation and cell procoagulation activity (PCA) were assessed in plasmic levels. Bleeding symptom was observed during As2O3 or ATRA treatment. RESULTS: TM expression in the APL cell surface was significantly upregulated from (14.31 +/- 1.60) ng/10(7) to (21.61 +/- 6.82) ng/10(7) cells.

LIF reduced the numbers of cells showing markers characteristic of mature cells of all neuronal classes and caused synaptic ectopia. The net effect was disrupted morphological development and disturbed synaptic organization.

Here, we identify the antialcoholism drug disulfiram and its analogue pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) as inhibitors of the 26S proteasome activity in a cell-based screening assay. As expected for proteasome inhibitors, these compounds also inhibited TNF-alpha-induced nuclear factor-KappaB (NF-KappaB) translocation and were cytotoxic. Disulfiram was more cytotoxic against chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at clinically achievable concentrations. Proteasome and NF-KappaB inhibition were achieved with a potency in the same range as that of the clinically used proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Disulfiram was also able to induce accumulation of p27(Kip1) and to prolong the half-life of c-Myc, both targets for proteasome-dependent degradation.

PROCEDURE: We used representational difference analysis to identify candidate E2A-HLF target genes. Transient transfection assays and an inducible expression model system were then used to evaluate the ability of E2A-HLF to modulate target gene expression. RESULTS: We identified ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) as a gene differentially expressed in ALL cell lines with and without E2A-HLF expression and demonstrated that t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines expressed high levels of ABCB1 protein and had a drug efflux-positive phenotype. Although ABCB1 transcription is regulated by C/EBPbeta via interaction with a DNA response element that shares significant homology with the optimal E2A-HLF binding site, E2A-HLF did not directly activate transcription of reporter genes under control of ABCB1 promoter elements in transient transfection assays. However, ABCB1 expression was induced in a DNA-binding independent manner by E2A-HLF, E2A-PBX1, and truncated E2A polypeptides consisting of those portions of E2A present in leukemic fusion proteins. CONCLUSIONS: E2A-HLF-mediated over-expression of ABCB1 may play a critical role in defining the clinical phenotype of ALLs with a t(17;19), suggesting pharmacologic modulation of ABCB1 activity as a rational therapeutic strategy for this chemotherapy resistant subtype of ALL.","['Baudis, Michael', 'Prima, Victor', 'Tung, Yoon Han', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Baudis M', 'Prima V', 'Tung YH', 'Hunger SP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine and the University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL 32610-0296, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Organic Anion Transporters/drug effects/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/10/06 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20635 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Nov;47(6):757-64. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20635.,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary cell colonies and Passage 2 colonies expressed stage specific embryonic markers SSEA-1, SSEA-3, and SSEA-4, and were alkaline phosphatase positive. In the absence of feeder layer and human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), these cells differentiated into variety of cell types and formed embryoid bodies. When cultured for an extended period of time, embryoid bodies differentiated into derivatives of three embryonic germ (EG) layers. These were characterized by detection of specific markers for differentiation such early mesoderm (FE-C6), embryonic myosin (F1-652), neural precursor (FORSE-1), and endoderm (anti-cytokeratin 18). To our knowledge, this is the first time that embryonic cell lines from in vitro produced and vitrified ovine blastocysts have been isolated and examined for detection of SSEA markers, and embryoid bodies have been cultured and examined for specific cell surface markers for differentiation.","['Dattena, M', 'Chessa, B', 'Lacerenza, D', 'Accardo, C', 'Pilichi, S', 'Mara, L', 'Chessa, F', 'Vincenti, L', 'Cappai, P']","['Dattena M', 'Chessa B', 'Lacerenza D', 'Accardo C', 'Pilichi S', 'Mara L', 'Chessa F', 'Vincenti L', 'Cappai P']","['Istituto Zootecnico e Caseario per la Sardegna, Olmedo (SS), Italy. mdattena@tiscali.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Blastocyst/*cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Sheep']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/10/18 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mrd.20378 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2006 Jan;73(1):31-9. doi: 10.1002/mrd.20378.,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Reverse seroconversion, defined as the clearance of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb) and the appearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in a patient with resolved HBV infection (i.e., a HBsAg-negative, HBsAb-positive, hepatitis B core antibody-positive patient) following receipt of a bone marrow transplant is described. A review of related cases in the literature was undertaken to identify clinical features associated with this phenomenon. RESULTS: We present a case of reactivation of HBV infection in a 47-year-old man after receipt of an allogeneic bone marrow transplant for acute myelogenous leukemia. Before undergoing bone marrow transplantation, the presence of HBsAb and hepatitis B core antibody and the absence of HBsAg indicated clearance of natural HBV infection. The donor was HBsAg and HBsAb negative. Twenty-nine months after bone marrow transplantation, the patient developed transaminitis and evidence of active HBV infection (the patient had test results positive for HBsAg, negative for HBsAb, and positive for HBV DNA). A total of 28 other cases of reverse seroconversion have been described in the literature, 11 of which provided adequate information to be summarized in detail together with the present case. Reactivation of HBV infection following bone marrow transplantation appears to occur almost exclusively in patients who have received marrow from an HBsAb-negative donor and have experienced graft-versus-host disease, the onset of which is associated with tapering of immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although HBV reverse seroconversion is an uncommon event, understanding the clinical features associated with the development of HBV reverse seroconversion may provide insight into how such a potentially fatal complication may be avoided.","['Kempinska, Anna', 'Kwak, Eun J', 'Angel, Jonathan B']","['Kempinska A', 'Kwak EJ', 'Angel JB']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Ottawa Hospital, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatitis B/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/07/14 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID36585 [pii]', '10.1086/496924 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Nov 1;41(9):1277-82. doi: 10.1086/496924.

The TK inhibitor imatinib mesylate selectively targets PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg and has proven successful in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. In recurrent glioblastoma, phase II therapy trials using imatinib mesylate have been initiated. As only a fraction of patients seems to benefit from imatinib mesylate therapy and due to potential side effects and high costs of imatinib mesylate therapy, selection of the right patients is important. The goal of our study was to assess systematically immunohistochemical expression of the major TKs targeted by imatinib mesylate in glioblastoma, as expression of these factors could be used to select patients for imatinib mesylate therapy. In a cohort of 101 glioblastoma patients, anti-PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg protein immunohistochemistry was performed. Expression of these proteins was assessed semi-quantitatively and correlated with patient survival.PDGFR-alpha and arg expression in tumor cells was widespread in 1/101 cases, respectively. Focal PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg immunolabeling was detected in 25/101, 19/101, 4/101, 7/101 and 31/101 cases, respectively. Statistical analysis did not reveal any correlation between expression of the TKs and patient survival. We show here for the first time in a large series of glioblastomas that PDGFR-alpha, -beta, c-kit, c-abl and arg expression is immunohistochemically detectable in a fraction of cases. The value of anti-tyrosine kinase immunolabeling as predictive factor for patient selection remains to be clarified by comparative analysis of tumor tissue of therapy-responders versus non-responders.","['Haberler, C', 'Gelpi, E', 'Marosi, C', 'Rossler, K', 'Birner, P', 'Budka, H', 'Hainfellner, J A']","['Haberler C', 'Gelpi E', 'Marosi C', 'Rossler K', 'Birner P', 'Budka H', 'Hainfellner JA']","['Institute of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Selection', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-005-4570-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2006 Jan;76(2):105-9. doi: 10.1007/s11060-005-4570-9.,,"['0 (ABI2 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing the genome-wide gene expression profiles of normal B-cell subsets and BCR-ABL1+ pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia cells by SAGE, the leukemia cells show loss of B lymphoid identity and aberrant expression of myeloid lineage-specific molecules. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL1+ pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia cells exhibit defective expression of IKAROS, a transcription factor needed for early lymphoid lineage commitment. As shown by inducible expression of BCR-ABL1 in human and murine B-cell precursor cell lines, BCR-ABL1 induces the expression of a dominant-negative IKAROS splice variant, termed IK6. Comparing matched leukemia sample pairs from patients before and during therapy with the BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor STI571 (Imatinib), inhibition of BCR-ABL1 partially corrected aberrant expression of IK6 and lineage infidelity of the leukemia cells. To elucidate the contribution of IK6 to lineage infidelity in BCR-ABL1+ cell lines, IK6 expression was silenced by RNA interference. Upon inhibition of IK6, BCR-ABL1+ leukemia cells partially restored B lymphoid lineage commitment. Therefore, we propose that BCR-ABL1 induces aberrant splicing of IKAROS, which interferes with lineage identity and differentiation of pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia cells.","['Klein, F', 'Feldhahn, N', 'Herzog, S', 'Sprangers, M', 'Mooster, J L', 'Jumaa, H', 'Muschen, M']","['Klein F', 'Feldhahn N', 'Herzog S', 'Sprangers M', 'Mooster JL', 'Jumaa H', 'Muschen M']","['Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diet therapy/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209133 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209133 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Feb 16;25(7):1118-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209133.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ovarian function was studied through a 40.7 month observation period, after chemotherapy, in 3 different groups: women treated with aGnRh, oral contraceptives treatment and no preventive-treatment. The differences in these groups as to menstrual cycle, blood ovarian hormones, age at diagnosis, type and dosage of chemotherapy administered were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by chi2 test with Yates correction and Fisher test. RESULTS: All patients treated with aGnRh and chemotherapy achieved a good ovarian function. A normal ovarian function was also obtained in 75% of patients treated with oral contraceptives and only in 59.3% of women with no preventive treatment. Significant difference was found comparing aGnRh group with no preventive-treatment group (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Use of GnRh analogs administered before beginning chemotherapy prevents from gonadal damage in all cases observed. Higher chemotherapy toxicity and older age at diagnosis time decrease ovarian function.","['Marchesoni, D', 'Driul, L', 'Fruscalzo, A', 'Santuz, M', 'Calcagno, A', 'Ianni, A', 'Geromin, A', 'Fanin, R']","['Marchesoni D', 'Driul L', 'Fruscalzo A', 'Santuz M', 'Calcagno A', 'Ianni A', 'Geromin A', 'Fanin R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Clinica di Ostetricia e Ginecologia, Universita degli Studi di Udine, Udine, Italy. diego.marchesoni@dsc.uniud.it']",['ita'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Minerva Ginecol,Minerva ginecologica,0400731,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Contraceptives, Oral/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Triptorelin Pamoate/therapeutic use']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Ginecol. 2005 Oct;57(5):545-50.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Contraceptives, Oral)', '08AN7WA2G0 (Triptorelin Pamoate)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",,,L'insufficienza ovarica prematura dopo chemioterapia in pazienti con neoplasie ematologiche.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether alcohol impairs NK cell function, particularly production of CC chemokines induced by interleukin (IL)-2, the natural ligands for CCR5 receptor. METHODS: Primary NK cells and NK cell line (YTS) were cultured with or without alcohol (10 to 80 mM) for three hours. The culture supernatants were then harvested and used to treat human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and a HeLa cell line, which expresses CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 receptors (MAGI cells). CC chemokine expression by YTS and primary NK cells treated with or without alcohol was analyzed with the real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. [Ca(2)(+)]i and Western blot assays were used to determine calcium-mediated intracellular signaling pathway and NF-kappaB p65 expression. HIV strains (Bal and UG024) were used to infect macrophages and MAGI cells. In addition, ADA (macrophage-tropic strain) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was carried out in macrophages. HIV infectivity was determined by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and beta-galactosidase activity assays. RESULTS: Alcohol inhibited IL-2-induced CC chemokine (CCL3 and CCL4) expression by NK cells. Functional tests demonstrated that this reduced expression of CC chemokines was associated with diminished anti-HIV ability of NK cells. Alcohol also reduced the ability of NK cells to response to CCL3-mediated chemotaxis. Alcohol inhibited IL-2-induced NF-kappaB p65 protein expression and calcium mobilization by NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol, through the inhibition of IL-2-induced NF-kappaB p65 protein expression and intracellular calcium mobilization, suppressed NK cell production of CC chemokines. This suppression of CC chemokine production was associated with diminished anti-HIV activity of NK cells. Thus, by inhibiting NK cell-mediated innate immunity against HIV, alcohol consumption may have a cofactor role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV disease.","['Zhang, Ting', 'Guo, Chang-Jiang', 'Douglas, Steven D', 'Metzger, David S', ""O'Brien, Charles P"", 'Li, Yuan', 'Wang, Yan-Jian', 'Wang, Xu', 'Ho, Wen-Zhe']","['Zhang T', 'Guo CJ', 'Douglas SD', 'Metzger DS', ""O'Brien CP"", 'Li Y', 'Wang YJ', 'Wang X', 'Ho WZ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Joseph Stokes Jr. Research Institute at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,IM,"['Adult', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokines, CC/*biosynthesis', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'HIV Infections/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/10/06 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['00000374-200509000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/01.alc.0000179364.32003.9f [doi]']",ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2005 Sep;29(9):1559-67. doi: 10.1097/01.alc.0000179364.32003.9f.,,"['0 (CCL4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",PMC4015110,,,,,"['AA13547/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA12815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AA013547/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA16022/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA012815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DA016022/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS575115'],,,,,,,,,,

Recent data have shown that the mTOR pathway is also aberrantly activated in hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This disease still has a bad prognosis and new therapeutic strategies are required. Rapamycin, used at low concentrations, induces the profound inhibition of AML cell clonogenic properties in 60% of cases while sparing their normal counterparts. Moreover, clinical responses have been achieved in poor-risk AML patients.

Mutations affecting the carboxylterminal domain of NPM occur in a significant percentage of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and these alterations create an additional nuclear export signal that relocalizes much of the protein from its normal nucleolar stores to the cytoplasm. When induced by oncogenic stress, the Arf tumor suppressor protein accumulates within the nucleolus, where it is physically associated with, and stabilized by, NPM. Ectopic overexpression of an NPM cytoplasmic mutant (NPMc) relocalized p19Arf and the endogenous NPM protein to the cytoplasm. NPMc-dependent export of p19Arf from the nucleus inhibited its functional interaction with the p53 negative regulator, Mdm2, and blunted Arf-induced activation of the p53 transcriptional program. Cytoplasmic NPM relocalization also attenuated Arf-induced sumoylation of Mdm2 and NPM and prevented wild type NPM from inhibiting p19Arf protein turnover. However, despite the ability of NPMc to interfere with these p53-dependent and independent activities of Arf, NPMc exhibited anti-proliferative activity in Arf-null NIH-3T3 cells. Overexpression of wild type NPM, but not NPMc, overcame premature senescence of Atm-null cells, a phenotype that can be rescued by inactivation of Arf or p53. Therefore, perturbation of Arf function appears to be insufficient to explain the oncogenic effects of the NPMc mutation. We favor the idea that NPMc also contributes to AML by dominantly perturbing other functions of the wild type NPM protein.","['den Besten, Willem', 'Kuo, Mei-Ling', 'Williams, Richard T', 'Sherr, Charles J']","['den Besten W', 'Kuo ML', 'Williams RT', 'Sherr CJ']","[""Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Protein Transport/genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",2005/10/06 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['2174 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.4.11.2174 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Nov;4(11):1593-8. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.11.2174.

We estimated the association between familial hematopoietic cancer and risk of lymphoma using validated, registry-based family data, and we also investigated whether associations between some environmental exposures and risk of lymphoma vary between individuals with and without such a family history. METHODS: In a population-based case-control study of malignant lymphoma, 1506 case patients and 1229 control subjects were linked to the Swedish Multi-Generation Register and then to the Swedish Cancer Register to ascertain history of cancer in first-degree relatives of patients with malignant lymphoma. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with the risk of lymphoma. RESULTS: A history of hematopoietic malignancy in any first-degree relative was associated with an increased risk of all NHL (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.5), common B-cell NHL subtypes, and HL. Relative risks were generally stronger in association with sibling hematopoietic cancer (OR for all NHL = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.3 to 7.6) than with parental hematopoietic cancer (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 2.3). A family history of NHL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was associated with an increased risk of several NHL subtypes and HL, whereas familial multiple myeloma was associated with a higher risk of follicular lymphoma. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity in NHL risk associations with environmental factors between individuals with and without familial hematopoietic malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of NHL and HL among individuals with a family history of hematopoietic malignancy was approximately twofold for both lymphoma types.

It is important that neutrophils undergo constitutive (spontaneous) apoptosis as a mechanism to facilitate normal cell turnover and immune system homeostasis. Conversely, several proinflammatory cytokines, including granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), prolong neutrophil survival. The molecular mechanisms that regulate PMN apoptosis or survival remain incompletely defined. To that end, we compared global gene expression in human neutrophils during spontaneous apoptosis with that in cells cultured with human GM-CSF. Genes encoding proteins that inhibit apoptosis, such as myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, caspase 8 and Fas-associated via death domain-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2)/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 2 (BNIP2), and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), were down-regulated coincident with neutrophil apoptosis. In contrast, those encoding apoptosis inhibitor 5, BCL2-like 1, BNIP2, CFLAR, SGK, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 were up-regulated in PMNs cultured with GM-CSF. Correspondingly, GM-CSF delayed PMN apoptosis (P<0.03), increased cell viability (P<0.03), and prolonged neutrophil phagocytic capacity (P<0.05). Prolonged functional capacity was paralleled by striking up-regulation of proinflammatory genes and proteins, including CD14, CD24, CD66, and human leukocyte antigen-DR. In addition, expression of SGK protein diminished during PMN apoptosis but was restored by culture with GM-CSF, suggesting SGK is involved in leukocyte survival.

Although Evi1 is clearly involved in leukemia, gene transfer studies in mice with Evi1 fail to cause leukemia, arguing that cooperating events are necessary. We reanalyzed AKXD-23 tumors for cooperating proviral insertion and found that each tumor had a proviral insertion in Sox4, which encodes an HMG-box transcription factor. RNA analysis revealed these insertions cause increased Sox4 expression. Overexpression of Sox4 in 32Dcl3 cells markedly inhibited cytokine-induced granulocyte maturation, as documented by morphologic and mRNA analysis. Sox4-expressing cells had higher levels of transcripts associated with proliferation, including Evi1. Conversely, in leukemic cells that express Sox4 and bear provirally activated Evi1, suppression of Sox4 with short hairpin RNAs resulted in down-regulation of both Sox4 and Evi1. By cotransfection studies, Sox4 is able to transactivate the AKV long terminal repeat, which likely explains how Sox4 transcriptionally up-regulates provirally activated Evi1; however, Sox4 does not appear to regulate the native Evi1 promoter. We propose that Sox4 proviral activation is selected for in the setting of prior proviral activation of Evi1, because it transactivates the relatively weak LTR of AKV leading to higher Evi1 expression and consequent block to differentiation.","['Boyd, Kathryn E', 'Xiao, Ying-Yi', 'Fan, Kai', 'Poholek, Amanda', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Perkins, Archibald S']","['Boyd KE', 'Xiao YY', 'Fan K', 'Poholek A', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Perkins AS']","['Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', '*Proviruses', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'SOXC Transcription Factors', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)67314-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2003-05-1626 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 15;107(2):733-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1626.

After years of stagnation, with treatment revolving around the use of rather ineffective drugs such as alkylators, many patients are now being treated with more effective agents such as purine analogs either alone or combined with other drugs and/or monoclonal antibodies. Treatment of patients refractory to these treatments is particularly challenging and should be decided only upon a careful evaluation of the disease, patient characteristics, and prognostic factors. Refractory disease should be clearly separated from relapsing disease. The only curative therapy for patients with CLL, including those with refractory disease, is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, the use of allogeneic transplantation is limited because of the advanced age of most patients and the high transplant-related mortality (TRM). Transplants with nonmyeloablative regimens may reduce TRM and allow more patients to receive transplants more safely. For patients in whom an allogeneic transplantation is not feasible or in whom it is deemed inappropriate, participation in phase 2 trials should be encouraged. Finally, to investigate mechanisms to overcome resistance to therapy in CLL and to identify patients that might gain benefit from early, intensive therapies (eg, based on biologic markers) constitute a challenge that needs active investigation.","['Montserrat, Emili', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Gine, Eva', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Montserrat E', 'Moreno C', 'Esteve J', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Gine E', 'Bosch F']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Villarroel, 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain. emontse@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)66375-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0819 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 15;107(4):1276-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0819.

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is highly effective in the treatment of CML, its continuous administration is associated with development of resistance, particularly in advanced phase or blast crisis. We investigate here whether a feature of disease progression (i.e., elevated expression of Bcr-Abl in CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients in blast crisis) has any bearing on the kinetics of resistance to imatinib. By studying cell lines that exogenously express Bcr-Abl over the range found from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we show that cells expressing high amounts of Bcr-Abl, as in blast crisis, are much less sensitive to imatinib and, more significantly, take a substantially shorter time for yielding a mutant subclone resistant to the inhibitor than cells with low expression levels, as in chronic phase. Our data suggest that the differential levels of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein expressed by CD34+ CML cells may reflect the extent and duration of their response to imatinib; the relatively high levels of oncoprotein in advanced-phase disease may underlie the observed rapid development of resistance.","['Barnes, David J', 'Palaiologou, Danai', 'Panousopoulou, Eleni', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Yong, Agnes S M', 'Wong, Alice', 'Pattacini, Laura', 'Goldman, John M', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Barnes DJ', 'Palaiologou D', 'Panousopoulou E', 'Schultheis B', 'Yong AS', 'Wong A', 'Pattacini L', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology']",2005/10/06 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/19/8912 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0076 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 1;65(19):8912-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0076.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, elevating the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) confers onto retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective agonists (""rexinoids"") the ability to induce terminal granulocyte differentiation and apoptosis of all-trans retinoic acid-resistant and insensitive AML cells and patients' blasts. Protein kinase A activation leads to corepressor release from the RAR subunit of the RAR-RXR heterodimer, resulting in ""desubordination"" of otherwise silent RXR, which acquires transcriptional competence in response to cognate ligands. Rexinoid-cAMP induction of endogenous RARbeta is blunted in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking RARs, but reintroduction of exogenous RARalpha reestablishes responsiveness, thus confirming that the RARalpha-RXR heterodimer is the rexinoid mediator. The apoptogenic effect of this treatment involves enhanced expression of the death receptor DR5 and its cognate ligand, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand, both of which are known to induce apoptosis in a tumor cell-selective manner and lead to the activation of initiator caspases. Immunohistochemistry confirmed induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand and DR5 in AML patient blasts cultured ex vivo. AML patients' blasts responded to rexinoid-cAMP combination treatment with induction of maturation and apoptosis, independent of karyotype, immunophenotype, and French-American-British classification status. Clonogenic assays revealed complete inhibition of blast clonogenicity in four out of five tested samples. Our results suggest that despite the genetic, morphologic, and clinical variability of this disease, the combination of rexinoids and cAMP-elevating drugs, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, might lead to a novel therapeutic option for AML patients by inducing a tumor-selective death pathway.","['Altucci, Lucia', 'Rossin, Aurelie', 'Hirsch, Oliver', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Vitoux, Dominique', 'Wilhelm, Emmanuelle', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'De Simone, Mariacarla', 'Schiavone, Ettore Mariano', 'Grimwade, David', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'de The, Hugues', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich']","['Altucci L', 'Rossin A', 'Hirsch O', 'Nebbioso A', 'Vitoux D', 'Wilhelm E', 'Guidez F', 'De Simone M', 'Schiavone EM', 'Grimwade D', 'Zelent A', 'de The H', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Department of Cell Biology and Signal Transduction, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch Cedex, C.U. de Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2005/10/06 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/19/8754 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3569 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 1;65(19):8754-65. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3569.,,"['0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (Tnfrsf10b protein, mouse)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The single therapeutic dose following a dosimetric dose was adjusted to give the same total body dose (in Gy) as that used for the original dose, or was attenuated if the platelet count was less than 150,000 per mm(3) or if the prior treatment resulted in grade 4 cytopenias lasting longer than 7 days.

MDV encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, Meq (MDV EcoQ). The bZIP domain of Meq shares homology with Jun/Fos, whereas the transactivation/repressor domain is entirely different. Increasing evidence suggests that Meq is the oncoprotein of MDV. Direct evidence that Meq transforms chicken cells and the underlying mechanism, however, remain completely unknown. Taking advantage of the DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast transformation system, a well established model for studying avian sarcoma and leukemia oncogenes, we probed the transformation properties and pathways of Meq. We found that Meq transforms DF-1, with a cell morphology akin to v-Jun and v-Ski transformed cells, and protects DF-1 from apoptosis, and the transformed cells are tumorigenic in chorioallantoic membrane assay. Significantly, using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, we have identified up-regulated genes such as JTAP-1, JAC, and HB-EGF, which belong to the v-Jun transforming pathway. In addition, c-Jun was found to form stable dimers with Meq and colocalize with it in the transformed cells. RNA interference to Meq and c-Jun down-modulated the expression of these genes and reduced the growth of the transformed DF-1, suggesting that Meq transforms chicken cells by pirating the Jun pathway. These data suggest that avian herpesvirus and retrovirus oncogenes use a similar strategy in transformation and oncogenesis.","['Levy, Alon M', 'Gilad, Oren', 'Xia, Liang', 'Izumiya, Yoshihiro', 'Choi, Jonathan', 'Tsalenko, Anya', 'Yakhini, Zohar', 'Witter, Richard', 'Lee, Lucy', 'Cardona, Carol J', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien']","['Levy AM', 'Gilad O', 'Xia L', 'Izumiya Y', 'Choi J', 'Tsalenko A', 'Yakhini Z', 'Witter R', 'Lee L', 'Cardona CJ', 'Kung HJ']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane/cytology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Luciferases', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/04/21 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['0506849102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0506849102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 11;102(41):14831-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0506849102.

Reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT may offer a less toxic approach to patients with AML. Targeted immunotherapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been shown to be safe, well tolerated in children, and, as a single agent, gemtuzumab ozogamicin has induced responses in 30% of patients with recurrent CD33+ AML. There are no safety data with gemtuzumab ozogamicin post allogeneic SCT in children. Therefore, we explored the feasibility and toxicity of targeted immunotherapy following reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT in children with CD33+ AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eight patients with CD33+ AML received a reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT following fludarabine 30 mg/m2 for 6 days and busulfan 3.2 mg/kg (<4 years, 4 mg/kg/d) for 2 days. Donor sources included six 6/6 HLA-matched related peripheral blood stem cells, one 6/6 sibling cord blood, and one 4/6 unrelated cord blood. RESULTS: Day 30 and day 60 donor chimerisms in seven of eight evaluable patients were 96 +/- 2% (n = 7) and 94 +/- 3% (n = 6), respectively. Five of six patients (too early for one patient) received two doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and one patient received only one dose. After each dose, all patients developed grade 4 neutropenia, with recovery on median days 16 and 13, respectively, after dose 1 and dose 2. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was only observed in 2 of 11 gemtuzumab ozogamicin courses. No patients have developed dose-limiting toxicity secondary to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin post reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT in children with average risk AML is feasible and well tolerated with minimal toxicity. The maximal tolerated dose has yet to be determined for gemtuzumab ozogamicin post reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT in children with CD33+ AML. Additional studies in a larger group of patients will be required to adequately assess the safety of this approach.","['Roman, Elizabeth', 'Cooney, Erin', 'Harrison, Lauren', 'Militano, Olga', 'Wolownik, Karen', 'Hawks, Ria', 'Foley, Sandi', 'Satwani, Prakash', 'Unal, Elif', 'Bhatia, Monica', 'Bradley, Brigid', 'Del Toro, Gustavo', 'George, Diane', 'Garvin, James', 'van de Ven, Carmella', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Roman E', 'Cooney E', 'Harrison L', 'Militano O', 'Wolownik K', 'Hawks R', 'Foley S', 'Satwani P', 'Unal E', 'Bhatia M', 'Bradley B', 'Del Toro G', 'George D', 'Garvin J', 'van de Ven C', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/19/7164s [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-1004-0018 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 1;11(19 Pt 2):7164s-7170s. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-1004-0018.,,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,['T32 HL07968/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, reactivation of Bcr-Abl via kinase domain mutations that reduce sensitivity to imatinib can cause relapse. As combination therapy is frequently used to prevent emergence of resistance, the combination of imatinib with an inhibitor of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants (e.g., Src/Abl inhibitors AP23848 and BMS-354825) was investigated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To test this approach, cellular proliferation and Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation assays were done on Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type (WT) Bcr-Abl and four common imatinib-resistant mutants (Y253F, E255K, T315I, and M351T). Colony-forming assays with primary CML cells were also done. RESULTS: Both Src/Abl inhibitors retained full inhibitory capacity when coadministered with imatinib at concentrations above typical clinical levels. For cells expressing WT Bcr-Abl or the marginally imatinib-resistant mutant M351T, inclusion of imatinib at therapeutic levels enhanced the effects of the Src/Abl inhibitors. By comparison, for the highly imatinib-resistant mutants Y253F and E255K, inclusion of imatinib at clinical levels resulted in only a slight enhancement beyond the effects of the Src/Abl inhibitors. None of the inhibitors affected Bcr-Abl T315I cells. Colony-forming assays with primary CML cells yielded analogous results. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Src/Abl inhibitors are compatible with imatinib and suggest that combined Abl inhibitor therapy is a feasible treatment strategy for patients with CML.","[""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Walters, Denise K', 'Stoffregen, Eric P', 'Sherbenou, Daniel W', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Deininger, Michael W N', 'Druker, Brian J']","[""O'Hare T"", 'Walters DK', 'Stoffregen EP', 'Sherbenou DW', 'Heinrich MC', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland 97239, USA. oharet@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phosphotyrosine/chemistry', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/02/09 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/19/6987 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0622 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 1;11(19 Pt 1):6987-93. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0622.,,"['0 (AP23848)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human interleukin-2 further potentiates the immunogenicity of human CD40 ligand in preclinical murine models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We prepared autologous B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that expressed both human CD40 ligand (>90% positive) and human interleukin-2 (median secretion, 1,822 pg/mL/10(6) cells; range, 174-3,604 pg). Nine patients were enrolled in a phase I trial, receiving three to eight s.c. vaccinations. RESULTS: Vaccinations were administered without evidence of significant local or systemic toxicity. A B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia-specific T-cell response was detected in seven patients. The mean frequencies of IFN-gamma, granzyme-B, and IL-5 spot-forming cells were 1/1,230, 1/1,450, and 1/4,500, respectively, representing a 43- to 164-fold increase over the frequency before vaccine administration. Three patients produced leukemia-specific immunoglobulins. Three patients had >50% reduction in the size of affected lymph nodes. Nonetheless, the antitumor immune responses were observed only transiently once immunization ceased. High levels of circulating CD4+/CD25+/LAG-3+/FoxP-3+ immunoregulatory T cells were present before, during and after treatment and in vitro removal of these cells increased the antileukemic T-cell reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that immune responses to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be obtained with human CD40 ligand/human interleukin-2-expressing s.c. vaccines but that these responses are transient. High levels of circulating regulatory T cells are present, and it will be of interest to see if their removal in vivo augments and prolongs the antitumor immune response.","['Biagi, Ettore', 'Rousseau, Raphael', 'Yvon, Eric', 'Schwartz, Mary', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Foster, Aaron', 'Havlik-Cooper, Diana', 'Grilley, Bambi', 'Gee, Adrian', 'Baker, Kelty', 'Carrum, George', 'Rice, Lawrence', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Popat, Uday', 'Brenner, Malcolm']","['Biagi E', 'Rousseau R', 'Yvon E', 'Schwartz M', 'Dotti G', 'Foster A', 'Havlik-Cooper D', 'Grilley B', 'Gee A', 'Baker K', 'Carrum G', 'Rice L', 'Andreeff M', 'Popat U', 'Brenner M']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. ettore.biagi@pediatriamonza.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Area Under Curve', 'B7-2 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/02/09 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/19/6916 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0484 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Oct 1;11(19 Pt 1):6916-23. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0484.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD223 antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",,,,,,['CA78792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel method to isolate bone marrow interstitial fluid, we examined if this fluid from 10 adult AML patients could affect normal bone marrow hematopoiesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bone marrow interstitial fluid was isolated by centrifugation of bone marrow biopsies obtained at time of diagnosis and 2 to 4 weeks after start of induction therapy. The isolated fluid was added to normal bone marrow CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells sampled from five healthy subjects. RESULTS: Unlike plasma, AML-derived bone marrow interstitial fluid clearly repressed hematopoietic progenitor cell growth as determined by an in vitro colony assay, an effect that was lost after successful induction treatment. Antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and adiponectin abolished growth inhibition by bone marrow interstitial fluid, suggesting a mechanistic role of these cytokines in impairing normal hematopoiesis in AML. The plasma levels of adiponectin and TNFalpha were unaffected by therapy whereas bone marrow interstitial fluid levels of both cytokines fell significantly in patients entering remission. Transcripts for TNFalpha, but not for adiponectin, were found in AML blast cells. Neither the plasma levels nor the bone marrow interstitial fluid levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor were appreciably elevated in the patients nor did they change with treatment.

PATIENT AND METHODS: We have analyzed clonality of mast cells in an 18-year-old patient suffering from acute myeloid leukemia with a complex karyotype including a t(8;21) and mastocytic transformation with a huge increase in immature mast cells and elevated serum tryptase level, but no evidence for a primary mast cell disease/mastocytosis. RESULTS: As assessed by in situ fluorescence hybridization combined with tryptase staining, both the tryptase-negative blast cells and the tryptase-positive mast cells were found to contain the t(8;21)-specific AML1/ETO fusion gene. Myeloablative stem cell transplantation resulted in complete remission with consecutive disappearance of AML1/ETO transcripts, decrease of serum tryptase to normal range, and disappearance of neoplastic mast cells.

In the present study, we found that calmodulin (CaM) is involved in the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of CERK. The CaM antagonist W-7 decreased both CERK activity and intracellular C1P formation. Additionally, exogenously added CaM enhanced CERK activity even at low concentrations of Ca(2+). The CERK protein was co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-CaM antibody, indicating formation of intracellular CaM.CERK complexes. An in vitro CaM binding assay also demonstrated Ca(2+)-dependent binding of CaM to CERK. These results strongly suggest that CaM acts as a Ca(2+) sensor for CERK. Furthermore, a CaM binding assay using various mutants of CERK revealed that the binding site of CERK is located within amino acids 422-435. This region appears to include a type 1-8-14B CaM binding motif and is predicted to form an amphipathic helical wheel, which is utilized in CaM recognition. The expression of a deletion mutant of CERK that contained the CaM binding domain but lost CERK activity inhibited the Ca(2+)-dependent C1P formation. These results suggest that this domain could saturate the CaM and hence block Ca(2+)-dependent activation of CERK. Finally, we reveal that in mast cell degranulation CERK acts downstream of CaM, similar to CaM-dependent protein kinase II, which had been assumed to be the main target of CaM in mast cells.","['Mitsutake, Susumu', 'Igarashi, Yasuyuki']","['Mitsutake S', 'Igarashi Y']","['Department of Biomembrane and Biofunctional Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita 12, Nishi 6, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cell Degranulation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Deletion', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Rats', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/03/07 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)59005-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M501962200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 9;280(49):40436-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M501962200.

However, although an increasing number of patients are able to achieve complete remission (CR), relapse is almost inevitable, because of the re-emergence of the malignant clone from small numbers of residual malignant cells. This phenomenon has introduced a need for a more sensitive assessment of low-level disease which, in turn, has encouraged the development of therapies aimed at the eradication of all residual disease in CR patients. The eradication of residual disease is associated with improved remission durability and has great potential in offering the possibility of cure. Alemtuzumab is the foundation of many eradication-based treatment approaches because of its ability to achieve clinical remissions and to successfully purge minimal residual disease (MRD) from both blood and bone marrow in B-CLL patients. This article describes and compares polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometric methodologies for the assessment of MRD, and presents data demonstrating that alemtuzumab can eliminate residual malignant cells from blood and bone marrow (whether assessed by PCR or flow cytometry) at the highest levels of sensitivity currently available. The ability to clear MRD from bone marrow in patients achieving clinical CR using alemtuzumab is a significant step forward in the treatment of B-CLL, and supports treatment strategies in which alemtuzumab is used in combination with other agents. Purging of MRD from both blood and bone marrow also enables patients to proceed to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a strategy that is able to achieve long-term remission.","['Montillo, Marco', 'Schinkoethe, Timo', 'Elter, Thomas']","['Montillo M', 'Schinkoethe T', 'Elter T']","[""Division of Haematology, Department of Oncology-Haematology, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy. m.montillo@tiscali.it""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/10/06 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['L5240W661340003K [pii]', '10.1080/07357900500201418 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2005;23(6):488-96. doi: 10.1080/07357900500201418.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unique fusion gene product translated, p210 (Bcr-Abl), is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that is specific to, and has a central role in the pathogenesis of, CML, making it an atractive target for drug therapy. Imatinib mesylate (IM) is one such therapy that also targets Abl, c-kit and PDGF-R tyrosine kinases. Although IM induces a much higher rate of complete cytogenetic remission (CCR), with improved tolerability and better progression free survival compared to other licensed therapies, resistance is a significant clinical problem. The most common mechanism of IM resistance is mutation of the Bcr-Abl kinase catalytic domain. In addition, molecular persistence in patients in CCR is most likely attributable to persisting Ph(+) stem cells that are insensitive to IM by unknown mechanisms and this is a major focus of current research interest. Current results from pre-clinical in vitro work on novel agents and combination strategies as well as clinical trials including immunotherapy approaches are reviewed. Despite the widespread use of molecularly targeted therapies and the development of new therapeutic drugs and strategies, it is our belief that there is a requirement for further research into and development of stem cell-directed therapies to overcome molecular persistence.

Zinc deficiency is associated with retardation of bone growth. Previous in vitro studies have suggested a direct effect of zinc on both the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells. However, the mechanisms for uptake of zinc into osteoblasts have not been examined in detail. Several families of zinc transporters have previously been characterized in mammalian cells; such transporters function in the uptake, intracellular sequestration or efflux of zinc. In the current study, we examined zinc transport in osteoprogenitor cells and have attempted to define a functional role for a zinc transport mechanism in osteogenic differentiation. We identified at least two zinc transporters in both human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and in osteoblastic cells--the ubiquitous zinc transporter, ZIP1, and LIV-1, which was previously characterized as a protein that is expressed in breast cancer cells. The subcellular localization of both these zinc transporters suggested distribution in both the plasma membrane and also diffusely in the cytoplasm. During the differentiation process of pluripotent MSCs into osteoblast-like cells, both zinc uptake and expression of the ZIP1 protein were increased. An adenoviral-mediated overexpression of ZIP1 in MSCs resulted in Alizarin-red-positive mineralization and also increased expression of specific osteoblast-associated markers, such as alkaline phosphatase, and of several osteoblast differentiation genes, including osteopontin, Cbfa1/Runx2, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and bone sialoprotein. An siRNA-mediated reduction of ZIP1 protein expression in MSCs caused decreased zinc uptake and inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation under osteogenic culture conditions. Finally, following overexpression of ZIP1 in MSCs, cDNA microarray analysis revealed differential regulation of several genes associated with the proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, these studies provide important insights into the role of a plasma membrane zinc transporter in the initiation of an osteogenic lineage from MSCs.","['Tang, Zhihui', 'Sahu, Surasri Nandan', 'Khadeer, Mohammed Abdul', 'Bai, Guang', 'Franklin, Renty B', 'Gupta, Anandarup']","['Tang Z', 'Sahu SN', 'Khadeer MA', 'Bai G', 'Franklin RB', 'Gupta A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, 4G-29, Dental School, University of Maryland, 666 West Baltimore Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Calcification, Physiologic/physiology', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteoblasts/*physiology', 'Osteogenesis/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Zinc/pharmacokinetics']",2005/10/06 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S8756-3282(05)00341-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2005.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2006 Feb;38(2):181-98. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2005.08.010.

Thus, covert genetic factors, cryptic mutations, and/or polymorphisms may interact with the seminal transforming genetic mutations to determine phenotype. The phenotype usually is expressed sufficiently to determine the lineage that is dominant in the leukemic clone by light microscopic examination, by cytochemistry of blood and marrow cells, and by immunophenotyping. The basis for the frequency of the AML phenotypes is unclear, although there is a rough concordance with the frequency of marrow precursor cells of different lineages.

Although genetic alterations during radiation-induced lymphoma- and leukemogenesis are fairly well studied, the role of epigenetic changes has been largely overlooked. Rodent models are valuable tools for identifying molecular mechanisms of lymphoma and leukemogenesis. A widely used mouse model of radiation-induced thymic lymphoma is characterized by a lengthy ""pre-lymphoma"" period. Delineating molecular changes occurring during the pre-lymphoma period is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of radiation-induced leukemia/lymphoma development. In the present study, we investigated the role of radiation-induced DNA methylation changes in the radiation carcinogenesis target organ--thymus, and non-target organ--muscle. This study is the first report on the radiation-induced epigenetic changes in radiation-target murine thymus during the pre-lymphoma period. We have demonstrated that acute and fractionated whole-body irradiation significantly altered DNA methylation pattern in murine thymus leading to a massive loss of global DNA methylation. We have also observed that irradiation led to increased levels of DNA strand breaks 6 h following the initial exposure. The majority of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks were repaired 1 month after exposure. DNA methylation changes, though, were persistent and significant radiation-induced DNA hypomethylation was observed in thymus 1 month after exposure. In sharp contrast to thymus, no significant persistent changes were noted in the non-target muscle tissue. The presence of stable DNA hypomethylation in the radiation-target tissue, even though DNA damage resulting from initial genotoxic radiation insult was repaired, suggests of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of radiation-related pathologies. The possible role of radiation-induced DNA hypomethylation in radiation-induced genome instability and aberrant gene expression in molecular etiology of thymic lymphomas is discussed.","['Koturbash, Igor', 'Pogribny, Igor', 'Kovalchuk, Olga']","['Koturbash I', 'Pogribny I', 'Kovalchuk O']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Lethbridge, Alta., Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'DNA Methylation/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', 'Genomic Instability/*radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Radiation', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism']",2005/10/06 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)02049-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.084 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Nov 18;337(2):526-33. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.09.084.

The basis for these translocation events is poorly understood, but it has been assumed that spatial positioning of genes in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells is a contributing factor. Analysis of the nuclear 3D position of the gene MLL, frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and five of its translocation partners (AF4, AF6, AF9, ENL and ELL), and two control loci revealed a characteristic radial distribution pattern in all hematopoietic cells studied. Genes in areas of high local gene density were found positioned towards the nuclear center, whereas genes in regions of low gene density were detected closer to the nuclear periphery. The gene density within a 2 Mbp window was found to be a better predictor for the relative positioning of a genomic locus within the cell nucleus than the gene density of entire chromosomes. Analysis of the position of MLL, AF4, AF6 and AF9 in cell lines carrying chromosomal translocations involving these genes revealed that the position of the normal genes was different from that of the fusion genes, and this was again consistent with the changes in local gene density within a 2 Mbp window. Thus, alterations in gene density directly at translocation junctions could explain the change in the position of affected genes in leukemia cells.","['Murmann, Andrea E', 'Gao, Juntao', 'Encinosa, Marissa', 'Gautier, Mathieu', 'Peter, Marcus E', 'Eils, Roland', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Rowley, Janet D']","['Murmann AE', 'Gao J', 'Encinosa M', 'Gautier M', 'Peter ME', 'Eils R', 'Lichter P', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, Section Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Muntjacs/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/10/06 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/10/06 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(05)00346-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.07.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2005 Nov 15;311(1):14-26. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.07.020.

Fucoidan significantly inhibited the growth of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ATL patients and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines but not that of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Fucoidan induced apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines mediated through downregulation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 and survivin and G1 phase accumulation through the downregulation of cyclin D2, c-myc, and hyperphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. Further analysis showed that fucoidan inactivated NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 and inhibited NF-kappaB-inducible chemokine, C-C chemokine ligand 5 (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) production, and homotypic cell-cell adhesion of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines.

The results showed that methylation of CHFR promoter was inactivated and could be reversed by treatment with a demethylating agent in Molt-4, Jurkat and U937. CHFR promoter methylation was detected in 39% of acute leukemia patients. There was no difference in incidence of CHFR promoter methylation between acute myelocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. In conclusion, CHFR is frequently inactivated in acute leukemia and is a good candidate for the leukemia supper gene. By affecting mitotic checkpoint function, CHFR inactivation likely plays a key role in tumorigenesis in acute leukemia. Moreover, the methylation of gene CHFR appears to be a good index with which to predict the sensitivity of acute leukemia to microtubule inhibitors.","['Gong, Hui', 'Liu, Wengli', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Xu, Huizhen']","['Gong H', 'Liu W', 'Zhou J', 'Xu H']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

This advancement is due in part to increasing awareness of prognostic factors and molecular heterogeneity of the disease which has helped to identify distinct risk groups of CLL. In addition, novel treatment regimens have demonstrated much higher complete and overall response rates than previously seen with conventional CLL therapy. Indeed, as complete response rates exceed 50%, curative therapy for CLL is within reach.

METHODS: EDRF1 sense and antisense constructs were transfected into HEL cells, then the expression of globin and erythropoietin receptor gene was identified by Northern blot analysis. RT-PCR and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) were carried out to monitor the expression and DNA-binding activity of erythroid specific transcription factor GATA-1 and NF-E2. RESULTS: In HEL cells with transfection of sense expression carrier, the experssion of EDRF1 mRNA was upregulated. In HEL cells with transfection of antisense expression carrier, the experession of EDRF1 mRNA was downregulated. In HEL cells with overexpression of EDRF1, production of alpha-globin was increased. In antisense EDRF1 overexpressed HEL cells, significant loss of alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA synthesis was observed. The expression of erythropoietin receptor was unchanged in HEL cells transfected with EDRF1 sense and antisense expression carriers. No significant change was found in expression of transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 in HEL cells transfected with empty carrier, sense expression carrier, and antisense expression carrier. However, the transcription activity of GATA-1 was severely impaired. Expression of erythropoietin receptor gene was not influenced by EDRF1 gene overexpression. CONCLUSION: EDRF1 regulates alpha- and gamma-globin gene synthesis by modulating DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 transcription factor. Overexpression and underexpression of EDRF1 do not significantly regulate the expression of GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA. Monitoring the EPOR signal pathway is not the mechanism by which EDRF1 influences the differentiation of erythrocyte.","['Wang, D', 'Shen, B', 'Li, Y']","['Wang D', 'Shen B', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,"['Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Chaperones/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/05 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/10/05 09:00'],"['2005/10/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Dec 25;81(24):1512-5.,,"['0 (AHSP protein, human)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the single dose tolerance test, twenty-seven healthy volunteers were randomly divided into 4 groups. rhTPO was injected subcutaneously at the doses of 0.25 microg/kg, 0.5 microg/kg, 1 microg/kg, and 2 microg/kg respectively. In the multiple dose tolerance test, 7 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute leukemia after chemotherapy received rhTPO at the dose of 1.0 microg/kg for 7 - 14 days. The symptoms (if any), complete blood count, platelet aggregation test, serum chemistry, and anti-rhTPO antibody were followed serially. RESULTS: Out of the 27 healthy volunteers receiving single dose of rhTPO, one showed transient increase of body temperature to 37.4 degrees C six hours after the injection; one felt mild fatigue, anorexia, and somnolence the day after injection, and one showed transient elevation of alanine transminase (ALT) and asparate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Single dose administration of rhTPO at the doses of 0.5 microg/kg, 1.0 microg/kg, and 2.0 microg/kg was associated dose-dependently with 24% - 52% increase of platelet count, peaking at the day 14 and returning to the baseline Level by, day 21. No abnormality was observed in aggregation function when the platelet count peaked. Single dose administration of rhTPO showed no influence on red blood cells and white blood cells. In the multiple dose group, rhTPO at the dose of 1.0 microg x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 7 - 14 days was well tolerated by patients with hemotological malignancies. One patient developed transient slight elevation of serum ALT and AST. After the treatment with rhTPO, platelet counts increased to some extent in 4 patients.

The present study aimed to determine the safety of central line placement in these patients. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 115 consecutive patients treated during a 10-year period. Data abstracted comprised age, gender, presenting and preoperative blood counts, type of central line, blood products transfused preoperatively, duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC], <500/microl), treatment, and central line-associated complications. RESULTS: There were 66 male and 49 female patients with a median age of 4 years. Seventy-one patients were classified as standard-risk and 44 as high-risk. Respective median blood counts at diagnosis and prior to surgery were white cell count (microl), 4,200 and 5,550; hemoglobin (g/dl), 7.7 and 9.4; platelet count (microl), 63,000 and 72,000; and ANC (microl), 3,950 and 4,900. The median duration of neutropenia was 15 days in the standard-risk group and 18 days in the high-risk group. Thirty-eight patients were not transfused preoperatively. There were no episodes of bacteremia. Seven patients (7%) with life-ports experienced a complication: in four blood could not be aspirated, two ports needed realignment, and one a wound infection developed without dehiscence. Four patients (27%) with external lines had a complication: one each with line occlusion, accidental removal by patient, line rupture, and line leakage at insertion site. The complication rate between ports and external lines was different (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Central line placement prior to anti-leukemia treatment is safe. Most complications are mechanical and not due to leukemia, chemotherapy, or cytopenias.","['Carr, Emily', 'Jayabose, Somasundaram', 'Stringel, Gustavo', 'Slim, Michel', 'Ozkaynak, M Fevzi', 'Tugal, Oya', 'Sandoval, Claudio']","['Carr E', 'Jayabose S', 'Stringel G', 'Slim M', 'Ozkaynak MF', 'Tugal O', 'Sandoval C']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/10/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20629 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Dec;47(7):886-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20629.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: A randomized cross-over trial (RCT) design with repeated measures was conducted with 23 children with ALL who attended the oncology outpatient clinic of a metropolitan university affiliated tertiary level pediatric hospital and who also received home visits from a community health services care provider in central Canada. RESULTS: During the home-treatment phase, children were more capable of maintaining their usual routines than when receiving hospital chemotherapy (Wilcoxon statistic = 80, P = 0.023), but they appeared to experience greater emotional distress (Wilcoxon sign rank statistic S = 66, P = 0.043) according to parental report. Treatment location had no effect on caregiver burden and adverse effects. No significant differences between groups existed with respect to societal costs of care. As the child's age increased, QOL improved relative to younger children (t(20) = -2.37, P = 0.02), the time burden related to child care tasks was reduced (t(21) = -3.56, P = 0.002), caregiver effort/difficulty in physical and behavioral support decreased (t(21) = -2.09, P = 0.049) and the odds of experiencing one or more adverse events decreased (OR = 0.79, CI = (0.63-1.00), chi(1) (2) = 4.01, P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: With few differences noted between groups, these results indicate preliminary support for administrating some or all of a child's chemotherapy at home. Home chemotherapy was associated with specific improvements and decrements in parent reported QOL. No effects were seen on burden of care, adverse events, or cost. Overall, young age adversely affected QOL, burden of care, and adverse events. These data provide important information to families and caregivers as they consider home or hospital-based therapy in childhood ALL.","['Stevens, Bonnie', 'Croxford, Ruth', 'McKeever, Patricia', 'Yamada, Janet', 'Booth, Marilyn', 'Daub, Stacey', 'Gafni, Amiram', 'Gammon, Janet', 'Greenberg, Mark']","['Stevens B', 'Croxford R', 'McKeever P', 'Yamada J', 'Booth M', 'Daub S', 'Gafni A', 'Gammon J', 'Greenberg M']","['Faculty of Nursing and Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Signy Hildur Eaton Chair in Paediatric Nursing Research, Sick Kids Hospital, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. b.stevens@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Family Health', 'Health Care Costs', '*Home Care Services, Hospital-Based/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', '*Oncology Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data', 'Ontario', '*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Safety', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2005/10/04 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20598 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Sep;47(3):285-92. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20598.,,,,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Sep;47(3):237-8.

BLM (Bloom's syndrome protein), a RecQ DNA helicase, and topoisomerase IIIalpha (Top3alpha) appear essential for the resolution of stalled replication forks (Holliday junctions). We investigated the involvement of BLM in the signaling response to Top1-mediated replication DNA damage. In BLM-complemented cells, BLM colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies and Top3alpha. Fibroblasts without BLM showed an increased sensitivity to camptothecin, enhanced formation of Top1-DNA complexes, and delayed histone H2AX phosphorylation (gamma-H2AX). Camptothecin also induced nuclear relocalization of BLM, Top3alpha, and PML protein and replication-dependent phosphorylation of BLM on threonine 99 (T99p-BLM). T99p-BLM was also observed following replication stress induced by hydroxyurea. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein and AT- and Rad9-related protein kinases, but not DNA-dependent protein kinase, appeared to play a redundant role in phosphorylating BLM. Following camptothecin treatment, T99p-BLM colocalized with gamma-H2AX but not with Top3alpha or PML. Thus, BLM appears to dissociate from Top3alpha and PML following its phosphorylation and facilitates H2AX phosphorylation in response to replication double-strand breaks induced by Top1. A defect in gamma-H2AX signaling in response to unrepaired replication-mediated double-strand breaks might, at least in part, explain the camptothecin-sensitivity of BLM-deficient cells.","['Rao, V Ashutosh', 'Fan, Angela M', 'Meng, Linghua', 'Doe, Christopher F', 'North, Phillip S', 'Hickson, Ian D', 'Pommier, Yves']","['Rao VA', 'Fan AM', 'Meng L', 'Doe CF', 'North PS', 'Hickson ID', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Bloom Syndrome/genetics/metabolism', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Helicases/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2005/10/04 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/20/8925 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.20.8925-8937.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Oct;25(20):8925-37. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.20.8925-8937.2005.,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",PMC1265790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are treated with intermittent steroid therapy. This study was undertaken to examine the relationship between steroid therapy for ALL and severity of varicella infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who were on Pediatric Oncology Group Protocol 9201 and had a history of varicella infection. Pediatric Oncology Group 9201 is a phase III study for the treatment of children with lesser risk ALL diagnosed between 1992 and 1999. Cases of varicella were coded 1 to 5 on the basis of severity: grade 1 caused minimal to no symptoms, grade 2 caused mild to moderate symptoms that did not require hospitalization, grade 3 caused symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir, grade 4 caused severe disease that had complications or that required intensive care, and grade 5 resulted in death. RESULTS: Of 697 enrolled patients, 110 (15.8%) developed primary varicella; 59% of these were male. For analysis, disease grade was dichotomized into nonsevere (grades 1 and 2) and severe (grades 3, 4, and 5). Of the 110 patients, 56 had nonsevere disease; 54 had severe disease, including 2 deaths. Of the patients whose varicella was diagnosed within 3 weeks of receipt of prednisone, 70% had severe infection, whereas only 44% of those who had not received prednisone within 3 weeks had severe infection. The odds ratio for having a severe infection within 3 weeks of prednisone versus >3 weeks is 2.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-7.9). By multivariate analysis, older age at ALL diagnosis, years from ALL diagnosis to VZV diagnosis, and VZV diagnosis within the 4-week period of interest (during or within 3 weeks of prednisone therapy) all were independently associated with an increased risk for severe infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date of varicella in children with ALL and provides convincing evidence that prednisone therapy during the VZV incubation period significantly increases the risk for developing severe varicella infection. In addition, older age is associated with more severe infection. Despite the varicella vaccine and a dropping incidence of primary infections, VZV remains a dangerous pathogen for pediatric patients with ALL. With the possible exception of induction therapy, patients who are on ALL therapy and are exposed to varicella should have steroid therapy delayed until after the VZV incubation period. These findings may have implications for other diseases that are treated with corticosteroids.","['Hill, Garick', 'Chauvenet, Allen R', 'Lovato, James', 'McLean, Thomas W']","['Hill G', 'Chauvenet AR', 'Lovato J', 'McLean TW']","['Department of Pediatrics, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Chickenpox/*complications/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2005/10/04 09:00,2005/12/29 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['116/4/e525 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2005-0219 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2005 Oct;116(4):e525-9. doi: 10.1542/peds.2005-0219.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL rearrangements and amplification are common in acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders and are associated with abnormal up-regulation of Hox gene expression. Although MLL is expressed throughout hematopoiesis, Hox gene expression is sharply down-regulated during differentiation, suggesting that either the activity of MLL or its association with target promoters must be regulated. Here we show that MLL associates with actively transcribed genes but does not remain bound after transcriptional down-regulation. Surprisingly, MLL is associated not only with promoter regions but also is distributed across the entire coding regions of genes. MLL interacts with RNA polymerase II (pol II) and colocalizes with RNA pol II at a subset of actively transcribed target in vivo. Loss of function Mll results in defects in RNA pol II distribution. Together the results suggest that an intimate association between MLL and RNA pol II occurs at MLL target genes in vivo that is required for normal initiation and/or transcriptional elongation.","['Milne, Thomas A', 'Dou, Yali', 'Martin, Mary Ellen', 'Brock, Hugh W', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Milne TA', 'Dou Y', 'Martin ME', 'Brock HW', 'Roeder RG', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2005/10/04 09:00,2006/04/21 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['0503630102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0503630102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 11;102(41):14765-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0503630102.

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.","['Subramanian, Aravind', 'Tamayo, Pablo', 'Mootha, Vamsi K', 'Mukherjee, Sayan', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Gillette, Michael A', 'Paulovich, Amanda', 'Pomeroy, Scott L', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Lander, Eric S', 'Mesirov, Jill P']","['Subramanian A', 'Tamayo P', 'Mootha VK', 'Mukherjee S', 'Ebert BL', 'Gillette MA', 'Paulovich A', 'Pomeroy SL', 'Golub TR', 'Lander ES', 'Mesirov JP']","['Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, 320 Charles Street, Cambridge, MA 02141, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genes, p53/physiology', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/mortality', 'Male', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",2005/10/04 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['0506580102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0506580102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 25;102(43):15545-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0506580102.

Gated selection of only the cell rows containing a tagged rare cell provides enrichment of the rare cell relative to background blood cells. We also designed the cell injector for laminar flow antibody labeling within 20s. The approach combines rapid laminar flow cell labeling with monolayer cell sorting thereby enabling rare cell target detection at sensitivity levels 1000 to 10,000 times that of existing flow cytometers.

Although diffuse areas of sclerosis as in scleroderma characterize the more advanced stages of the sclerodermoid form, the initial circumscribed plaques would be more correctly described as morpheaform. Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) (a fibrosing disorder related to deep morphea) and lichen sclerosus (LS) have also been reported as manifestations of sclerodermoid GVHD. However, these two presentations of GVHD have not been emphasized in the dermatologic literature. We describe 6 patients, all of whom developed LS and two of whom also developed EF in the context of chronic GVHD. Each patient presented clinically with hypopigmented plaques that exhibited wrinkling, scaling, and follicular plugging. These lesions demonstrated the classic histologic features of LS including epidermal atrophy; a subepidermal zone of pale-staining, homogenized collagen; and a bandlike lymphocytic infiltrate. Although all patients eventually developed morpheaform and/or sclerodermoid GVHD, LS was a prominent part of the initial presentation of chronic cutaneous GVHD in every case. The LS lesions tended to occur on the neck and upper to mid aspect of the trunk, whereas morpheaform lesions favored the lower aspect of the trunk. EF involved the extremities (sparing the hands and feet), and was characterized clinically by an acute onset of pain and edema followed by induration with a rippled appearance. This case series serves to expand the spectrum of sclerodermoid GVHD, with LS as the most superficial and EF as its deepest manifestation.","['Schaffer, Julie V', 'McNiff, Jennifer M', 'Seropian, Stuart', 'Cooper, Dennis L', 'Bolognia, Jean L']","['Schaffer JV', 'McNiff JM', 'Seropian S', 'Cooper DL', 'Bolognia JL']","['Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. schafj04@med.nyu.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,"['Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Eosinophilia/*etiology', 'Fasciitis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/surgery', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2005/10/04 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(05)01989-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2005.06.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2005 Oct;53(4):591-601. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.06.015.,,,,,,,,,['J Am Acad Dermatol. 2006 Oct;55(4):729.

With the aim of identifying the immunophenotypic profile of B-CLL subsets with different prognoses, we investigated by flow cytometry the expression of 36 surface antigens in 117 cases, 113 with survival data. In analogy with GEP, results were analyzed by applying unsupervised hierarchical algorithms (surface-antigen expression profiling, SEP). Distinct immunophenotypic groups (A, B1, B2 and C) were identified, group C (57/117) with longer survivals, as compared to groups A (23/117), B1 (16/117) and B2 (21/117). The immunophenotypic signatures of these groups were characterized by the coordinated and differential over-expression of: i) CD62L, CD54 and CD49c (group C); ii) CD38 and CD49d (group A); iii) none of the above markers (group B1 and B2). Other molecules were either not expressed, widely expressed by all samples, or were variably expressed within the observed B-CLL subgroups, although without a clearly distinguishable pattern. By employing an identical approach for investigating the reactivity of B-cell panel monoclonal antibodies (B-mAbs) in B-CLLs (29 cases) and in 19 B and non-B leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, we found mAbs (B012, B001, B006, B018, B019, B020, B017) mainly unreactive in all the samples, mAbs (B002, B010, B013, B014, B015) strongly reactive in B-CLLs and B-cell lines but not in non-B-cell lines, and mAbs recognizing antigens variably expressed in cell lines and B-CLLs. A hierarchical clustering focused on B-CLLs alone, combining reactivity values for B-mAbs with the expression of CD62L and CD38, these latter antigens identified as leader markers of B-CLL subsets with different prognosis, demonstrated a correlation between CD62L expression and the reactivity of B007, B003, B011 and B005 mAbs.

We investigated the mechanism of preventive action of procyanidin B2 against oxidative DNA damage in human cultured cells and isolated DNA. Procyanidin B2 inhibited the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the human leukemia cell line HL-60 treated with an H2O2-generating system. In contrast, a high concentration of procyanidin B2 increased the formation of 8-oxodG in HL-60 cells. Experiments with calf thymus DNA also revealed that procyanidin B2 decreased 8-oxodG formation by Fe(II)/H2O2, whereas procyanidin B2 induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II), and H2O2 extensively enhanced it. An electron spin resonance spin trapping study utilizing 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (M4PO) demonstrated that procyanidin B2 decreased the signal of M4PO-OH from H2O2 and Fe(II), whereas procyanidin B2 enhanced the signal from H2O2 and Cu(II). As an antioxidant mechanism, UV-visible spectroscopy showed that procyanidin B2 chelated Fe(II) at equivalent concentrations. As a pro-oxidant property, we examined DNA damage induced by procyanidin B2, using 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from genes relevant to human cancer. Our results raise the possibility that procyanidin B2 exerts both antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties by interacting with H2O2 and metal ions.","['Sakano, Katsuhisa', 'Mizutani, Mika', 'Murata, Mariko', 'Oikawa, Shinji', 'Hiraku, Yusuke', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Sakano K', 'Mizutani M', 'Murata M', 'Oikawa S', 'Hiraku Y', 'Kawanishi S']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Biflavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Catechin/*pharmacology', 'Cations, Divalent/toxicity', 'Copper/toxicity', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism', 'Iron/toxicity', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Proanthocyanidins/*pharmacology']",2005/10/04 09:00,2006/02/18 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2005/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(05)00299-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2005 Oct 15;39(8):1041-9. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.05.024.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biflavonoids)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proanthocyanidins)', '29106-49-8 (procyanidin B2)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genistein and related phytoestrogens are of interest as chemopreventive agents for a variety of diseases and cancers based on epidemiologic evidence of reduced cancer rates in populations with a high intake of soy. Although soy and its constituents have been consumed at high levels in Asian populations without apparent adverse effects, concern has been raised of potential adverse effects due to estrogenic and other activities of the isoflavones. In these studies, genistein was evaluated for mutagenicity and clastogenicity in vitro in the S. typhimurium assay (Ames Test), the mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo in the micronucleus test in mice and rats. There was no evidence for a mutagenic effect in the in vitro S. typhimurium assay with and without metabolic activation (S9). In the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, genistein increased resistant mutants with and without metabolic activation (S9), which were predominantly small colonies indicating that genistein acts as a clastogen. Three independent in vivo micronucleus tests were performed in Moro mice, RAIf rats and Wistar rats. MORO male and female mice were treated orally for 14 days at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. RAIf and Wistar male and female rats were treated orally at doses up to 2000 mg/kg without an increase in micronuclei in treated mice or rats. It is concluded that genistein was not mutagenic in the S. typhimurium assay or mutagenic or clastogenic in vivo in the mouse and rat micronucleus test. In the mouse lymphoma assay, genistein induced an increase of predominantly small colonies indicating that genistein acts as a clastogen.

It detected a 98-kDa surface antigen with weak expression on a restricted number of leukaemia cell lines under reducing conditions. SC3 mAb labelled 5-10% of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes corresponding almost exclusively to B lymphocytes, and 60-70% of tonsillar B cells. It did not react with erythrocytes, platelets or monocytes whereas it stained granulocytes. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression and functional effects of SC3 mAb reactive epitope on normal and malignant B cells. Most SC3+ B cells from healthy donors were CD23+, some co-expressed CD5 and CD27 and a few were CD38+. SC3 epitope was expressed exclusively by B-lineage malignant proliferations, including B-lineage ALL. Practically, all B-CLL studied expressed SC3 mAb reactive epitope although with variable intensity, while MCL and PLL were negative. Other low grade and high grade B-NHL were variably stained. SC3 mAb alone triggered the proliferation of CD2-depleted PBL and significantly increased the proliferation induced by suboptimal concentrations of LPS. This effect was much weaker with B-CLL cells but was increased after cross-linking with an anti-IgM antibody. The restricted expression pattern combined with molecular weight and functional data indicate that SC3 mAb may detect a novel B-cell antigen mostly expressed by early and naive B cells. Although its expression in B-cell malignancies was not limited to a single differentiation stage, it might confer specific functional characteristics to the positive malignant cells.","['Nikolova, Maria', 'Guenova, Margarita', 'Taskov, Hristo', 'Marie-Cardine, Anne', 'Boumsell, Laurence', 'Bensussan, Armand']","['Nikolova M', 'Guenova M', 'Taskov H', 'Marie-Cardine A', 'Boumsell L', 'Bensussan A']","['National Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight']",2005/10/04 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(05)00159-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellimm.2005.08.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2005 Jul-Aug;236(1-2):92-100. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2005.08.013.

Structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations are common, and their detection is vital for leukemia diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of response to therapy. Fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations are necessary but not sufficient for leukemogenesis, and there is intense research activity to elucidate the cooperating molecular abnormalities that may be suitable targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Candidate gene approaches have identified mutations in kinases and transcription factors in a proportion of patients, but more comprehensive genomic approaches are required. Gene expression profiling accurately classifies known subtypes of acute leukemia and has highlighted potentially leukemogenic abnormalities in gene expression. Newer techniques, such as single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to analyze changes in gene copy number and zygosity, cancer genome sequencing, and RNA interference, are promising tools to identify mutations, although at present, data from these approaches are limited.

Recent advances in genetic testing and studies of cohorts of cancer patients have demonstrated the likelihood of identifying a cancer susceptibility mutation for numerous childhood cancers. Inherited predisposition to cancer is frequently the result of dominant constitutional mutations in tumor suppressor genes, which can be inherited from an affected parent or occur de novo during gametogenesis. In this article, we review the childhood malignancies that are associated with at least a 10% likelihood of being caused by a genetic susceptibility to cancer and therefore warrant consideration for a genetic evaluation; these malignancies include retinoblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, atypical teratoid and malignant rhabdoid tumors, optic pathway tumors, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, vestibular schwannomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, hemangioblastomas, medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas. Children with other malignancies may also warrant genetic evaluation if there is the co-occurrence of malignancy and two or more congenital anomalies, or malignancy and a significant family history of related cancers.

APL can be treated successfully in most instances by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy, which induces endpoint maturation of the leukaemic promyelocytes with the characteristic t(15;17). Annexin II (AnII), a profibrinolytic protein, has been implicated in the bleeding manifestation seen in APL. Our group has shown previously that high levels of AnII are expressed on other acute myeloid leukaemia subtypes that are sometimes associated with disordered haemostasis, albeit less frequently than APL. This study examined the effects of ATRA on AnII expression and cell differentiation, on myeloid leukaemia cell lines to determine whether a regulatory influence on AnII may contribute to the return of haemostatic stability in APL following treatment. The results confirmed that AnII expression in the APL cell line (NB4) was significantly downregulated in response to ATRA (P < 0.01), with associated morphological and immunophenotypical evidence of myeloid differentiation. ATRA also downregulated AnII expression on other myeloid cell lines, albeit to a lesser extent than observed on NB4 cells.

JAK2(V617F) was detected in either archived bone marrow or blood cells from 73 patients (48.7%) but none were homozygous for the mutant allele. Parameters at diagnosis that were significantly associated with the presence of JAK2(V617F) included advanced age and higher counts of both haemoglobin and leucocytes. During follow-up, patients with the mutation were more likely to transform into PV but the incidences of AML, MMM, or thrombotic events were similar between patients with and without the mutation. Multivariate analysis identified advanced age, higher haemoglobin level, and thrombosis history but not the presence of JAK2(V617F) as independent predictors of inferior survival.

Thus the epidemiology and outcome of A. terreus infections over the past 10 years was assessed. We analysed 67 cases of proven invasive aspergillosis (IA) according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria, investigated antifungal susceptibility of amphotericin B (AMB), voriconazole and caspofungin and performed molecular typing of A. terreus. Patients with proven IA caused by A. terreus (n = 32) and non-A. terreus (n = 35) were evaluated. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, underlying disease, antifungal prophylaxis and duration of neutropenia (P > 0.05). Leukaemia was the most common underlying malignancy. Fungal dissemination occurred in 63% of the patients. Aspergillus terreus infections were associated with a lower response rate to AMB therapy (20%), compared with 47% for patients with non-A. terreus infections (P < 0.05). In vitro, A. terreus was found to be resistant to AMB and molecular typing discriminated between patients isolates, showing a high strain diversity with 26 distinct types (I-XXVI) identified by combination of three primers. Aspergillus terreus infections displayed evidence of AMB resistance in vitro and in vivo and were associated with a high rate of dissemination and poor outcome; A. terreus causes systemic infections of endemic character in Tyrol, Austria. The onset of A. terreus infection depends not on the degree of immunosuppression but on environmental Aspergillus spp. exposure.","['Lass-Florl, Cornelia', 'Griff, Katharina', 'Mayr, Astrid', 'Petzer, Andreas', 'Gastl, Gunter', 'Bonatti, Hugo', 'Freund, Martin', 'Kropshofer, Gabriele', 'Dierich, Manfred P', 'Nachbaur, David']","['Lass-Florl C', 'Griff K', 'Mayr A', 'Petzer A', 'Gastl G', 'Bonatti H', 'Freund M', 'Kropshofer G', 'Dierich MP', 'Nachbaur D']","['Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Social Medicine, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. cornelia.lass-floerl@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', '*Aspergillus/genetics', 'Austria', 'Caspofungin', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Peptides, Cyclic/therapeutic use', 'Prevalence', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2005/10/04 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5763 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05763.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Oct;131(2):201-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05763.x.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overwhelming majority of respondents used prophylaxis in all cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma (97%) and Burkitt lymphoma (96%). Ninety-six per cent of respondents required risk factors to be present before prophylaxis was initiated in cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The commonest risk factor was site of involvement (paranasal sinus 88%, testicular 85%, orbital cavity 78%, bone marrow 65% and bone 28%). Other risk factors included stage IV, high International Prognostic Index score, >1 extranodal site and raised lactate dehydrogenase levels (34%, 21%, 16% and 10%). A total of 82% did not give prophylaxis in follicular lymphoma and 90% used intrathecal chemotherapy as their preferred method of prophylaxis. The most popular regimen was 12.5 mg methotrexate with each cycle of chemotherapy for six courses. Thirty-nine per cent used systemic chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis either alone (4%) or as an adjunct to intrathecal prophylaxis (35%).

We focus here on a special type of such data, referred to as semi-competing risks data. In this article, we develop methods for making inferences regarding dependence of semi-competing risks data across strata of a discrete covariate Z. A class of rank statistics for testing constancy of association across strata are proposed; its asymptotic properties are also derived.

Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that the majority of patients with acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia overexpress CREB in the bone marrow. CREB overexpression is associated with poor initial outcome of clinical disease in AML patients. CREB is a transcription factor that functions in glucose homeostasis, growth-factor-dependent cell survival, and memory. Signaling by hematopoietic growth factors, such as GM-CSF, results in activation of CREB and up-regulation of CREB target genes. To study its role in hematopoiesis, we overexpressed CREB in leukemia cell lines and in mice. CREB overexpression resulted in increased survival and proliferation of myeloid cells and blast-transformation of bone marrow progenitor cells from transgenic mice expressing CREB in the myeloid lineage. CREB transgenic mice also develop myeloproliferative disease after 1 year. Thus, CREB acts as a protooncogene to regulate hematopoiesis and contributes to the leukemia phenotype. Our results suggest that CREB-dependent pathways may serve as targets for directed therapies in leukemia in the future.","['Shankar, Deepa B', 'Cheng, Jerry C', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Shankar DB', 'Cheng JC', 'Sakamoto KM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, and Mattel Children's Hospital, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics/physiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/10/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/10/01 09:00'],"['2005/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21401 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Nov 1;104(9):1819-24. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21401.,,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,30,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,"['CA16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, exposure of MLL bcr-carrying plasmid DNA to S1 nuclease or nuclear extracts or purified topoisomerase II elicited cleavages at the nucleotide positions of nick formation on human genomic DNA.

C-Myb binding facilitates histone tail acetylation, which is mandatory during activation of prevalent differentiation genes in conjunction with CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP). Leukemogenic mutations in v-Myb eliminate the interaction with H3 and acetylation of H3 tails and abolish activation of endogenous differentiation genes. In primary v-myb-transformed myeloblasts, pharmacologic enhancement of H3 acetylation restored activation of differentiation genes and induced cell differentiation.

Previously, we showed that although most adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cells express the TRAIL death receptor DR4 (TRAIL-R1) or DR5 (TRAIL-R2), they are resistant to TRAIL. Thus, in this study, we tried to find natural products that can overcome TRAIL resistance. Among more than 150 materials screened, a dihydroflavonol that was extracted from Blumea balsamifera (BB-1) exhibited the most striking synergism with TRAIL. Treatment of the TRAIL-resistant ATLL cell line KOB, with a combination of BB-1 and TRAIL, resulted in apparent apoptosis that was not observed on treatment with either agent alone. Furthermore, pretreatment with BB-1 followed by TRAIL further augmented the synergism. BB-1 increased the level of TRAIL-R2 promoter activity and surface protein expression in a p53-independent manner. TRAIL-R2 siRNA inhibited the synergism, indicating that sensitization was caused by the increase of TRAIL-R2 expression. More interestingly, similar effects were observed in other leukemia cell lines by exactly the same mechanisms.

Treated cells showed a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptotic cells, compared to untreated cells. We also assessed the effect of CCI-779 in a NOD/SCID xenograft model. We treated a total of 68 mice generated from the same patient samples with CCI-779 after establishment of disease. Animals treated with CCI-779 showed a decrease in peripheral-blood blasts and in splenomegaly. In dramatic contrast, untreated animals continued to show expansion of human ALL.

We conclude that MTIs can inhibit the growth of adult human ALL and deserve close examination as therapeutic agents against a disease that is often not curable with current therapy.","['Teachey, David T', 'Obzut, Dana A', 'Cooperman, Jonathan', 'Fang, Junjie', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Choi, John K', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Brown, Valerie I', 'Grupp, Stephan A']","['Teachey DT', 'Obzut DA', 'Cooperman J', 'Fang J', 'Carroll M', 'Choi JK', 'Houghton PJ', 'Brown VI', 'Grupp SA']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/10/01 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/10/01 09:00'],"['2005/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)68438-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-05-1935 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Feb 1;107(3):1149-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-05-1935.

Retroviral particles may also incorporate GPs derived from other enveloped viruses via active or passive mechanisms, a process known as ""pseudotyping."" To further understand the mechanisms of pseudotyping, we have investigated the capacity of murine leukemia virus (MLV) or lentivirus core particles to recruit GPs derived from different virus families: the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), the hemagglutinin from an influenza virus, the E1E2 glycoproteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV-E1E2), and the retroviral Env glycoproteins of MLV and RD114 cat endogenous virus. The parameters that influenced the incorporation of viral GPs onto retroviral core particles were (i) the intrinsic cell localization properties of both viral GP and retroviral core proteins, (ii) the ability of the viral GP to interact with the retroviral core, and (iii) the expression of the lentiviral Nef protein. Whereas the hemagglutinin and VSV-G glycoproteins were recruited by MLV and lentivirus core proteins at the cell surface, the HCV and MLV GPs were most likely recruited in late endosomes. In addition, whereas these glycoproteins could be passively incorporated on either retrovirus type, the MLV GP was also actively recruited by MLV core proteins, which, through interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of the latter GP, induced its localization to late endosomal vesicles. Finally, the expression of Nef proteins specifically enhanced the incorporation of the retroviral GPs by increasing their localization in late endosomes.","['Sandrin, Virginie', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic']","['Sandrin V', 'Cosset FL']","['INSERM U412, Lyon Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, and IFR128 BioSciences Lyon-Gerland, Lyon, F-69007 France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/virology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Endosomes/virology', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, nef/*metabolism', 'Hemagglutinins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Lentivirus/growth & development/physiology', 'Lentivirus Infections/metabolism/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development/*physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",2005/10/01 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2005/10/01 09:00'],"['2005/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)47831-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M506070200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Jan 6;281(1):528-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M506070200.

We studied induction and regulation of CYP26A1 expression and ATRA metabolism in human intestinal (Caco-2), liver (HepG2), endothelial (HUVEC), and APL (NB4) cell lines. ATRA rapidly induced upregulation of CYP26A1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Other retinoids (retinol, 9-cis-RA, and 13-cis-RA) also induced significant CYP26A1 expression in HepG2 and NB4 cells. CYP26A1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells returned to baseline in 48 h upon removal of ATRA from the culture medium, suggesting that the expression is reversible and requires the presence of ATRA. In endothelial cells, however, a higher concentration of ATRA (10 microM) was required to induce expression of CYP26A1. A specific RA receptor-alpha antagonist totally inhibited ATRA-induced expression of CYP26A1, indicating that RA receptor-alpha plays a major role in CYP26A1 expression in HepG2 cells. Liposomal incorporation of ATRA has been shown to alter its metabolism. Therefore, we also tested CYP26A1 expression after administration of free ATRA and liposomal ATRA (L-ATRA). L-ATRA induced lower CYP26A1 expression and metabolic activity in HepG2 and NB4 cells when compared with free ATRA. Pretreatment of cells with free ATRA resulted in higher metabolic activity as indicated by conversion of radiolabeled [3H]-ATRA into its metabolites (4-oxo-RA and 4-hydroxy-RA), which was associated with lower nuclear localization of [3H]-ATRA when compared with pretreatment with L-ATRA. Our data suggest that upregulation of CYP26A1 expression in intestinal, endothelial, liver, and APL cells and metabolism of ATRA may play a role in rapid clearance of ATRA after continuous oral administration. Therapeutic strategies such as liposomal encapsulation and intermittent administration of ATRA may circumvent accelerated ATRA metabolism and improve the treatment of APL.","['Ozpolat, Bulent', 'Mehta, Kapil', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel']","['Ozpolat B', 'Mehta K', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Section of Immunobiology and Drug Carriers, The University of Texas, M.

Functional maturity and distribution of DC sub-types (DC1 and DC2) differ between the different stem cell sources used (bone marrow, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilised peripheral blood and cord blood) resulting in various rates of graft-vs-host disease and graft-vs-leukemia activity. Although DC recovery following stem cell transplantation is prompt, graft-vs-host disease and the use of immunosuppressive drugs result in qualitative and quantitative disturbances in DC homeostasis and have been observed for up to 1 year after transplantation. Complete donor DC chimerism seems to be a pre-requisite for the development of chronic GVHD and for graft-vs-leukemia activity, at least following reduced-intensity transplants, although in the early phase of acute graft-vs-host disease the presence of host antigen-presenting cells is essential. Preliminary data show promising results with DC-based immunotherapy for treatment of viral and fungal infections and of leukemic relapse following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

This cytotoxicity was dependent on the generation of superoxide anion and oxidized glutathione. In this article we have shown that the pro-oxidant effect of PDTC in AML cells induces NF-kappaB activity.

The molecular events downstream of methylation inhibition are less well known. Here, DAC was shown to induce apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (p53 mutant and wild type) but not in epithelial or normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Apoptosis was characterized by activation of the mitochondrial but not the receptor death pathway, as demonstrated by the release of cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blotting and enzyme assays showed that caspase-3, but not caspase-6 or caspase-8, were activated. Decitabine induced expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, arresting AML cell lines in G1 of the cell cycle. Expression of p21 was induced irrespective of the methylation status of its promoter, mediated instead via reexpression of the tumor suppressor p73, an upstream regulator of p21. The promoter of p73 was hypermethylated in AML cell lines in vitro and in primary AML cells ex vivo but not in DAC-resistant epithelial cells. In conclusion, DAC acts on leukemic myeloid cells via caspase activation, which may be dependent on demethylation of the hypermethylated p73 promoter and consequent reexpression of p73.","['Tamm, Ingo', 'Wagner, Mandy', 'Schmelz, Karin']","['Tamm I', 'Wagner M', 'Schmelz K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsmedizin Berlin Charite, Campus Virchow, Berlin, Germany. ingo.tamm@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism']",2005/09/30 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-005-0013-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Dec;84 Suppl 1:47-53. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-0013-0.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While current data suggest no therapeutic use for JAK1 and TYK2 inhibition, JAK2 inhibition seems a promising but not definitively tested mechanism for treatment of leukemia.

Despite the prevalence of CLL, progress in its treatment has been only modest over the past three decades. Based upon the ability of fludarabine to produce high-grade remissions especially among patients with low initial tumor mass, and the ability of alkylators to reduce tumor mass, we hypothesized that sequential administration of a limited number of cycles of intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide followed by fludarabine could result in a larger percentage of patients with complete remissions (CRs). In all, 27 of the 49 eligible patients achieved overall responses of CR, unconfirmed complete remission (UCR), or PR, for a total response rate of 55% (95% confidence interval (CI) 40-69%).

This score includes several prognostic factors except serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). We evaluated the prognostic power of LDH as an additional variable in IPSS-based risk assessment. For this purpose, a total of 892 patients with primary MDS registered by the Austrian-German cooperative MDS study group was analyzed retrospectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed the value of established parameters such as medullary blasts, karyotype and peripheral cell counts and showed that elevated LDH was associated with decreased overall survival (P<0.00005) and increased risk of AML development (P<0.00005), independent of the system used to classify MDS (FAB or WHO). Moreover, elevated LDH was found to be a significant predictor of poor survival within each IPSS risk group and within each FAB group except RAEB-T. To exploit these results for refined prognostication, each IPSS risk group was split into two separate categories (A=normal LDH vs B=elevated LDH). Using this LDH-assisted approach, it was possible to identify MDS patients with unfavorable prognosis within the low and intermediate IPSS risk groups. We propose that the IPSS+LDH score should improve clinical decision-making and facilitate proper risk stratification in clinical trials.","['Germing, U', 'Hildebrandt, B', 'Pfeilstocker, M', 'Nosslinger, T', 'Valent, P', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Lubbert, M', 'Haase, D', 'Steidl, C', 'Krieger, O', 'Stauder, R', 'Giagounidis, A A N', 'Strupp, C', 'Kundgen, A', 'Mueller, T', 'Haas, R', 'Gattermann, N', 'Aul, C']","['Germing U', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Nosslinger T', 'Valent P', 'Fonatsch C', 'Lubbert M', 'Haase D', 'Steidl C', 'Krieger O', 'Stauder R', 'Giagounidis AA', 'Strupp C', 'Kundgen A', 'Mueller T', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N', 'Aul C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology , Heinrich-Heine-University, Germany. germing@med.uni-Duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",2005/09/30 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403963 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403963 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2223-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403963.,,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Episomes containing either the MLL BCR, or deletion constructs of 367 bp or larger, were cleaved at the same position as genomic MLL after exposure to apoptotic stimuli. Further analysis of sequence motifs surrounding the cleaved region of MLL showed the presence of both a predicted nuclear matrix attachment sequence and a potential strong binding site for topoisomerase II, flanking the site of cleavage.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of the mTOR pathway and glycolysis would synergistically impact the energy metabolism in cancer cells and may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy to kill malignant cells. Using human lymphoma cells and leukemia cells, we demonstrated that the combination of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, with a glycolytic inhibitor produced synergistic cytotoxic effect, as evidenced by apoptosis and cell growth inhibition assays. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin alone sufficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of the downstream molecules p70S6K and 4E-BP-1, but only caused a moderate cytostatic effect. Combination of mTOR inhibition and blockage of glycolysis synergistically suppressed glucose uptake and severely depleted cellular ATP pools, leading to significant enhancement of cell killing. In contrast, combination of rapamycin and ara-C did not increase cytotoxicity in vitro. Our findings suggest that targeting mTOR pathway in combination with inhibition of glycolysis may be an effective therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies. This mechanism-based drug combination warrants further investigation in preclinical and clinical settings.","['Xu, R-H', 'Pelicano, H', 'Zhang, H', 'Giles, F J', 'Keating, M J', 'Huang, P']","['Xu RH', 'Pelicano H', 'Zhang H', 'Giles FJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/30 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403968 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403968 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2153-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403968.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,"['CA100428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109041/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Final report of the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG CLL1).,PI71-9,"BACKGROUND: We previously published an early report of a randomized, multicenter trial on the efficacy and toxicity of cladribine (2-CdA) + prednisone (P) compared with chlorambucil (Chl) + P in previously untreated patients with progressive or symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here we present the final report of this study. MATERIAL/METHODS: Of 229 patients, 126 received 2-CdA+P and 103 Chl+P. Patients with no response or progression after three courses or who relapsed earlier than 12 months after completing one treatment were switched to the other. Patients who relapsed later were retreated with the same schedule as before. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were retreated with 2-CdA+P and 19 with Chl+P. Overall response (and complete response) rates were 35% (6%) and 47% (16%), respectively. In 50 patients initially treated with Chl+P and then with 2-CdA+P, complete response (CR) was achieved in 12 (24%) and overall response (OR) in 32 (64%). In 28 patients originally treated with 2-CdA+P and then with Chl+P, CR in 1 (3%, p=0.01) and OR in 6 (21%, p=0.003) were obtained. We found no statistically significant difference in overall survival time in patients treated initially with 2-CdA+P and Chl+P aged 60 years (4.63 and 5.27 years, respectively, p=0.45), 60-70 years (3.29 and 3.14 years, p=0.79), and >70 years (1.53 and 1.93 years, p=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: 2-CdA+P is significantly more effective as a second-line treatment and re-treatment than Chl+P.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Italian, Dutch, and Hungarian groups participated in this study denominated IDH-ALL-91, and 494 children were enrolled. Treatment consisted of a BFM-type modified backbone with omission of the IB part in induction and elimination of two doses of anthracyclines during reinduction in both arms at the beginning of continuation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive (YES-ASP) or not (NO-ASP) 20 weekly HD-l-ASP (25,000 IU/m2). RESULTS: The event-free-survival and overall survival probabilities at 10 years for the entire group were 82.5% (1.8) and 90.3% (1.3), respectively. Of the 490 patients eligible for random assignment, 355 (72.4%) were randomly assigned (178 YES-ASP and 177 NO-ASP). After a median follow-up of 9 years, the probability of disease-free survival at 10 years was 87.5% (SE, 2.5) for YES-ASP arm versus 78.7% (SE, 3.3) for NO-ASP arm (P = .03). In multivariate analysis, NO-ASP arm (P = .03), male sex (P = .004), and age older than 10 years (P = .0003) had a significantly adverse impact on outcome. CONCLUSION: In this subset of patients, selected with criteria not including monitoring of minimal residual disease, application of extended HD-l-ASP may improve prognosis, compensating reduced leukemia control that results from adoption of a reduced-intensity BFM-backbone for treatment of children with SR ALL.","['Pession, Andrea', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'Magyarosy, Edina', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'van der Does, Anna', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Arico, Maurizio']","['Pession A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Masera G', 'Kamps WA', 'Magyarosy E', 'Rizzari C', 'van Wering ER', 'Lo Nigro L', 'van der Does A', 'Locatelli F', 'Basso G', 'Arico M']","['Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. andrea.pession@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/30 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/28/7161 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.11.411 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 1;23(28):7161-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.11.411.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze methylation of the ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-5, APAF-1, ASPP-1, CDH1, CDH13, DAPK, DIABLO, DKK-3, LATS-1, LATS-2, NES-1, p14, p15, p16, p57, p73, PARK-2, PTEN, sFRP1/2/4/5, SHP-1, SYK, TMS-1, and WIF-1 genes in samples from 50 consecutive T-ALL patients (19 children and 31 adults). Results were compared with results obtained in 286 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). RESULTS: A total of 88% of the T-ALL samples had at least one gene methylated. According to the number of methylated genes observed in each individual sample, 12 patients (24%) were included in the CIMP- group (zero to two methylated genes), and 38 patients (76%) were included in the CIMP+ group (> two methylated genes). Clinical features and remission rate did not differ significantly among both groups of patients. Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 12 years and overall survival (OS) rate at 13 years were 100% and 91% for the CIMP- group and 20% and 17% for the CIMP+ group, respectively (P = .0006 and P = .003, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that methylation profile was an independent prognostic factor in predicting DFS (P = .05) and OS (P = .02). A group of five genes (SYK-1, ASPP-1, sFRP-2, sFRP-5, and WIF-1) showed specificity for T-ALL compared with B-ALL.

We tested this strategy in humans. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with lymphoid malignant diseases or acute leukemia underwent an experimental conditioning regimen with 10 doses of total lymphoid irradiation (80 cGy each) plus antithymocyte globulin, followed by an infusion of HLA-matched peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from related or unrelated donors who received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. RESULTS: Of the 37 transplant recipients, only 2 had acute GVHD after hematopoietic-cell transplantation. Potent antitumor effects in patients with lymphoid malignant diseases were shown by the change from partial to complete remission. In the transplant recipients who underwent conditioning with total lymphoid irradiation and antithymocyte globulin, the fraction of donor CD4+ T cells that produced interleukin-4 after in vitro stimulation increased by a factor of five, and the proliferative response to alloantigens in vitro was reduced, as compared with normal control subjects and control subjects who underwent conditioning with a single dose of total-body irradiation (200 cGy).

For survivors the mean +/- sd levels for RANTES were 7656 +/- 877 pg ml(-1) on the day prior to chemotherapy, 3723 +/- 2443 pg ml(-1) on the first day of fungal infection diagnosis (significantly different from baseline; P = 0.001) and 9078 +/- 2256 pg ml(-1) at recovery from the fungal infection (significantly different from lowest value; P < 0.0001). Platelet counts were closely correlated with the RANTES levels (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). The RANTES concentrations for the three patients who died were similar to those who survived at all equivalent timepoints, but were significantly lower at the time of death (792 +/- 877) compared to the values at recovery for survivors (P = 0.005). The finding that patients who died from an invasive fungal infection had very low platelet counts and RANTES concentrations suggests that these could play a role in host response to such infections.","['Ellis, Michael', 'Al-Ramadi, Basel', 'Hedstrom, Ulla', 'Alizadeh, Hussain', 'Shammas, Victor', 'Kristensen, Jorgen']","['Ellis M', 'Al-Ramadi B', 'Hedstrom U', 'Alizadeh H', 'Shammas V', 'Kristensen J']","['Department of Medicine1 and Department of Medical Microbiology2, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University Medical School, PO Box 17666, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates 3Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tawam Hospital, PO Box 15555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Medicine1 and Department of Medical Microbiology2, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University Medical School, PO Box 17666, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates 3Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tawam Hospital, PO Box 15555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Medicine1 and Department of Medical Microbiology2, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University Medical School, PO Box 17666, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates 3Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tawam Hospital, PO Box 15555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Medicine1 and Department of Medical Microbiology2, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University Medical School, PO Box 17666, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates 3Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tawam Hospital, PO Box 15555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Medicine1 and Department of Medical Microbiology2, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University Medical School, PO Box 17666, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates 3Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tawam Hospital, PO Box 15555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'Department of Medicine1 and Department of Medical Microbiology2, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University Medical School, PO Box 17666, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates 3Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tawam Hospital, PO Box 15555, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Microbiol,Journal of medical microbiology,0224131,IM,"['Chemokine CCL5/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mycoses/*blood/complications', 'Platelet Count']",2005/09/30 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jmm.0.46121-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Microbiol. 2005 Nov;54(Pt 11):1017-1022. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.46121-0.,,['0 (Chemokine CCL5)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/jmm.0.46121-0 [doi],,,,,,

Given the absence of effective therapies for HIE, it is important to derive new strategies. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential as a therapeutic tool for the repair of a number of central nervous system disorders that involve cell loss. This study was designed to transplant the neural stem cells derived from human fetal brain (hNSCs) into cerebral ventricle of neonatal rat following hypoxic-ischemic injury and to investigate their survival, migration and differentiation in rat brain. METHODS: Cells obtained from the forebrain of a 12-week old fetus were cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor for 11 days. Animal models were built in 7-day-postnatal Wistar rats, 3-days after hypoxia-ischemia (HI), 5 microl suspension containing 5.0 x 10(5) hNSCs was injected into the left cerebral ventricle of each HIE rat by using stereotactic instrument. No immunosuppression therapy was given to the animals. At 1, 2, 4 weeks and 3 months after transplantation, the rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were harvested and were then examined by H-E staining and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Implanted cells expressing human nuclear protein (hNP) migrated form the subventricular zone (SVZ) along corpus callosum to the damaged areas, especially to the injured side of cortex and hippocampus. In different areas, the implanted hNSCs differentiated into different cell types which were similar to the host cells. The 85% implanted cells in cortex consisted of hNuc-NF or hNuc-Tublin double positive cells, while in the migratory way, 60% implanted cells differentiated into hNuc-GFAP double positive cells. Compared with the 1-week time point, an increased number of hNP-positive cells were observed at 2-weeks, but the number of these cells greatly decreased at 4-weeks and 3 months. CONCLUSION: The implanted hNSCs could extensively survive, migrate in the brain of neonatal rat with HIE and could differentiate into neurons and astrocytes in a regionally specific manner.","['Qu, Su-qing', 'Luan, Zuo', 'Yin, Guo-cai', 'Guo, Wan-li', 'Hu, Xiao-hong', 'Wu, Nan-hai', 'Yan, Feng-qing', 'Qian, Yang-ming']","['Qu SQ', 'Luan Z', 'Yin GC', 'Guo WL', 'Hu XH', 'Wu NH', 'Yan FQ', 'Qian YM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, the Navy General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100037, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Carotid Artery, Common/surgery', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Movement', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Stem Cells/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/complications/physiopathology', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain/*pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Injections, Intraventricular/methods', 'Ligation/methods', '*Neurons', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2005/09/30 09:00,2010/07/17 06:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Aug;43(8):576-9.,,['0 (Nuclear Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relapse rates remain high. The effectiveness of each protocol depends on how quickly the clearance of blast cells is achieved. In an attempt to improve survival, by minimizing treatment toxicity and relapse rate, different therapeutic protocols were used every 3 yr in our Unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1991-2000, 132 children with ALL were diagnosed in our Unit. Modified and intensified NY II and BFM protocols, in three consecutive periods [(Hematology/Oncology Pediatric Department of the University of Athens) HOPDA-91, HOPDA-94, HOPDA-97] were used. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 96 months, the 8-year overall survival (OS) was 88% +/- 3%, whereas the event-free survival (EFS) was 85% +/- 3%. There was a significant increase of the 5-year EFS of the high-risk (HR) group through time (65% in HOPDA-91 vs. 80% in HOPDA-97), whereas EFS of the low risk (LR) group in HOPDA-97 was 96%.

METHODS: The study included all newly diagnosed, statewide cases of childhood lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 1988-1994 among children aged <15 years. Of the 2642 cases (over 6.6 million children in California and 46 million child-years of observation) during this period, 2570 (97.3%) could be successfully geocoded for the analyses. An a priori classification of the >850 chemical agents reported in use during the study was developed by assigning the agents to eight chemical groupings of interest and identifying seven individual high-use agents with high potential toxicity. Rate ratios for neighborhood (block group) levels of pesticide use were estimated with a Poisson regression and adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, and gender. RESULTS: The rates of childhood lymphoma and leukemia were not generally higher in high pesticide-use areas. Those of Hodgkin's disease, although based on small numbers (N=258), were slightly elevated in the areas with the highest use of several pesticide groupings. CONCLUSIONS: The generally null results in this study systematically examining the risk relationships for residential proximity to agricultural pesticide use stand in contrast to existing epidemiologic literature suggesting elevated childhood cancer risks from reported household pesticide use. These differences may be due to different chemical agents or to differences in indoor versus outdoor exposure potential or both. Future studies should use refined methods that better characterize the exposure potential for children to these agents.","['Reynolds, Peggy', 'Von Behren, Julie', 'Gunier, Robert', 'Goldberg, Debbie E', 'Hertz, Andrew']","['Reynolds P', 'Von Behren J', 'Gunier R', 'Goldberg DE', 'Hertz A']","['California Department of Health Services, Environmental Health Investigations Branch, 1515 Clay Street, Suite 1700, Oakland (CA) 94612, USA. preynold@dhs.ca.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,IM,"['California/epidemiology', 'Child', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Pesticides/*toxicity']",2005/09/30 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/09/30 09:00'],"['2005/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['896 [pii]'],ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2005;31 Suppl 1:46-54; discussion 5-7.,,['0 (Pesticides)'],,,,,,['R01 CA71745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine if modifications to the IgE-binding epitopes of a major peanut allergen would result in a safer immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of peanut-allergic patients. IgE-binding epitopes on the Ara h 2 allergen were modified, and modified Ara h 2 (mAra h 2) protein was produced. Wild-type (wAra h 2) and mAra h 2 proteins were analyzed for their ability to interact with T-cells, their ability to bind IgE, and their ability to release mediators from a passively sensitized RBL-2H3 cell line. Multiple T-cell epitopes were identified on the major peanut allergen, Ara h 2. Ara h 2 amino acid regions 11-35, 86-125, and 121-155 contained the majority of peptides that interact with T-cells from most patients. The wAra h 2 and mAra h 2 proteins stimulated proliferation of T-cells from peanut-allergic patients to similar levels. In contrast, the mAra h 2 protein exhibited greatly reduced IgE-binding capacity compared to the wild-type allergen. In addition, the modified allergen released significantly lower amounts of beta-hexosaminidase, a marker for IgE-mediated RBL-2H3 degranulation, compared to the wild-type allergen.","['King, Nina', 'Helm, Ricki', 'Stanley, J Steven', 'Vieths, Stefan', 'Luttkopf, Dirk', 'Hatahet, Lina', 'Sampson, Hugh', 'Pons, Laurent', 'Burks, Wesley', 'Bannon, Gary A']","['King N', 'Helm R', 'Stanley JS', 'Vieths S', 'Luttkopf D', 'Hatahet L', 'Sampson H', 'Pons L', 'Burks W', 'Bannon GA']","[""Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Arkansas Children's Research Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,IM,"['2S Albumins, Plant', 'Allergens/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/immunology', 'Plant Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2005/09/29 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mnfr.200500073 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2005 Oct;49(10):963-71. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200500073.,,"['0 (2S Albumins, Plant)', '0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Ara h 2 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,['5K24 AI 01666/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide information on the late complications of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the authors prospectively studied the frequency of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in survivors of ALL in the initial years after the completion of therapy. Children and adolescents were classified as having the metabolic syndrome if they met three or more of the following criteria: hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high fasting glucose, obesity, and hypertension. Obesity was defined on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2) standard deviation scores or z-scores. Cutoff points for triglycerides and HDL were taken from equivalent pediatric percentiles with the cutoff points proposed by the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII). Hyperglycemia was defined using the ATPIII cutoff points. Elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure was defined as a value greater than the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. Fifty-two subjects (29 male and 23 female) with a median age of 15.2 years (range 6.1-22.6 years) were evaluated. Median interval since completion of therapy was 37 months (range 13-121 months). All of them had been treated according to the ALL-BFM 90 chemotherapy protocol and none had received cranial radiotherapy. Of the 52 subjects, 25 (48%) were overweight (BMI z-score >1.5) and 3 (5.76%) were obese (BMI z-score >2); among them, 1 was severely obese (BMI z-score >2.5). Three criteria for the metabolic syndrome (high triglyceride levels, glucose intolerance, and obesity) were fulfilled by three subjects (5.76%). Twenty-nine subjects (55.7%) had at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Hyperglycemia and hypertension were infrequent.

The authors report a case of successful cord blood transplantation (CBT) with a nonmyeloablative regimen (NMR) for MIOP. The patient was a 9-month-old girl with MIOP. Before this diagnosis, she had received chemotherapy under the tentative diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. She was on mechanical ventilation with tracheotomy due to the progression of MIOP when CBT with NMR was undergone. The conditioning regimen included fludarabine, melphalan, and antithymocyte globulin. Cyclosporine A and methylprednisolone were used for prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day 26 after SCT and has been fully maintained up to the present. Although grade 3 graft-versus-host disease and hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred, both were controllable.

Exposure of U937 cells to a low concentration of LAQ824 (30 nM) resulted in a delayed (2 h) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1), pRb dephosphorylation, growth arrest of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase, and differentiation. On the other hand, exposure of cells to a higher concentration of LAQ824 (75 nM) resulted in the early (30 min) generation of ROS, arrest of cells in G(2)/M phase, down-regulation of XIAP (at the transcriptional level) and Mcl-1 (through a caspase-mediated process), the acid sphingomyelinase-dependent generation of ceramide, and profound mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis. LAQ824-induced lethality in U937 cells did not involve the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, nor was it associated with death receptor up-regulation; instead, it was markedly inhibited by ectopic expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), XIAP, and Mcl-1. The free radical scavenger N-acetyl cysteine blocked LAQ824-mediated ROS generation, mitochondrial injury, Mcl-1 down-regulation, ceramide generation, and apoptosis, suggesting a primary role for oxidative injury in LAQ824 lethality. Together, these findings indicate that LAQ824-induced lethality represents a multifactorial process in which LAQ824-mediated ROS generation is necessary but not sufficient to induce apoptosis, and that the degree of XIAP and Mcl-1 down-regulation and ceramide generation determines whether this agent engages a maturation rather than an apoptotic program.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Maggio, Sonia C', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Payne, Shawn G', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Spiegel, Sarah', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Maggio SC', 'Almenara JA', 'Payne SG', 'Atadja P', 'Spiegel S', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*physiology']",2005/09/29 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.105.017145 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.105.017145 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Jan;69(1):216-25. doi: 10.1124/mol.105.017145.

We used microarrays to investigate, in 190 children with ALL at initial diagnosis, whether 70 key apoptosis genes were differentially expressed between leukemic subgroups defined by lineage, genetic subtype, in vitro drug resistance, and clinical outcome. The expression of 44 of 70 genes was significantly different in T-versus B-lineage ALL, 22 genes differed in hyperdiploid versus nonhyperdiploid, 16 in TEL-AML1-positive versus-negative, and 13 in E2A-rearranged versus germ-line B-lineage ALL. Expression of MCL1 and DAPK1 was significantly associated with prednisolone sensitivity, whereas BCL2L13, HRK, and TNF were related to L-asparaginase resistance. BCL2L13 overexpression was also associated with unfavorable clinical outcome (P < .001). Multivariate analysis including known risk factors revealed that BCL2L13 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P = .011). The same trend was observed in a validation group of 92 children with ALL treated on a different protocol at St Jude (P = .051).

KIT D816V is associated with constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity and thus represents an attractive drug target. However, imatinib and most other TK inhibitors fail to block the TK activity of KIT D816V. We show that the novel TK-targeting drugs PKC412 and AMN107 counteract TK activity of D816V KIT and inhibit the growth of Ba/F3 cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of KIT D816V as well as the growth of primary neoplastic mast cells and HMC-1 cells harboring this KIT mutation. PKC412 was a superior agent with median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 50 to 250 nM without differences seen between HMC-1 cells exhibiting or lacking KIT D816V. By contrast, AMN107 exhibited more potent effects in KIT D816V(-) HMC-1 cells. Corresponding results were obtained with Ba/F3 cells exhibiting wild-type or D816V-mutated KIT. The growth-inhibitory effects of PKC412 and AMN107 on HMC-1 cells were associated with induction of apoptosis and down-regulation of CD2 and CD63. PKC412 was found to cooperate with AMN107, imatinib, and cladribine (2CdA) in producing growth inhibition in HMC-1, but synergistic drug interactions were observed only in cells lacking KIT D816V.

Ten pools of chemically mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were challenged with a murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), and cells that failed to be transduced were enriched by cell sorting. Each pool yielded a clonally derived cell line with a 5-fold or greater resistance to virus infection, and five cell lines exhibited a >50-fold resistance. These five cell lines were efficiently infected by a human immunodeficiency virus vector pseudotyped with VSV-G. When engineered to express the TVA receptor for subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A), the five cell lines were resistant to infection with a MLV vector pseudotyped with the ASLV-A envelope protein but were fully susceptible to infection with an ASLV-A vector. Thus, the defect in these cells resides after virus-cell membrane fusion and, unlike those in other mutant cell lines that have been described, is specific for the MLV core. To identify the specific stages of MLV infection that are impaired in the resistant cell lines, real-time quantitative PCR analyses were employed and two phenotypic groups were identified. Viral infection of three cell lines was restricted before reverse transcription; in the other two cell lines, it was blocked after reverse transcription, nuclear localization, and two-long terminal repeat circle formation but before integration. These data provide genetic evidence that at least two distinct intracellular gene products are required specifically for MLV infection. These cell lines are important tools for the biochemical and genetic analysis of early stages in retrovirus infection.","['Bruce, James W', 'Bradley, Kenneth A', 'Ahlquist, Paul', 'Young, John A T']","['Bruce JW', 'Bradley KA', 'Ahlquist P', 'Young JA']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 53706-1596, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Clone Cells', 'Cricetinae', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Replication']",2005/09/29 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/20/12969 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.20.12969-12978.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Oct;79(20):12969-78. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.20.12969-12978.2005.,,,PMC1235846,,,,,"['CA70810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA022443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA070810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythroid cells infected with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) proliferate in the absence of Epo and show constitutive activation of Epo signal transduction pathways. We previously demonstrated that the ERK pathway was constitutively activated in Friend SFFV-infected erythroid cells, and in this study JNK is also shown to be constitutively activated. Pharmacological inhibitors of both the ERK and JNK pathways stopped the proliferation of primary erythroleukemic cells from Friend SFFV-infected mice, with little induction of apoptosis, and furthermore blocked their ability to form Epo-independent colonies. However, only the JNK inhibitor blocked the proliferation of erythroleukemia cell lines derived from these mice. The JNK inhibitor caused significant apoptosis in these cell lines as well as an increase in the fraction of cells in G(2)/M and undergoing endoreduplication. In contrast, the growth of erythroleukemia cell lines derived from Friend murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-infected mice was inhibited by both the MEK and JNK inhibitors. JNK is important for AP1 activity, and we found that JNK inhibitor treatment reduced AP1 DNA-binding activity in primary erythroleukemic splenocytes from Friend SFFV-infected mice and in erythroleukemia cell lines from Friend MuLV-infected mice but did not alter AP1 DNA binding in erythroleukemia cell lines from Friend SFFV-infected mice.

We observed that while quiescent primary CD4(+) T cells do not express detectable levels of HSPGs, HSPGs are expressed on primary CD4(+) T cells following immune activation. Enzymatic modification of HSPGs on the surfaces of either established CD4(+) T-cell lines or primary CD4(+) T cells dramatically reduced the binding of both soluble HTLV-1 SU and HTLV-1 virions. HSPGs also affected the efficiency of HTLV-1 entry, since blocking the interaction with HSPGs markedly reduced both the internalization of HTLV-1 virions and the titer of HTLV-1 pseudotyped viral infection in CD4(+) T cells. Thus, HSPGs play a critical role in the binding and entry of HTLV-1 into CD4(+) T cells.","['Jones, Kathryn S', 'Petrow-Sadowski, Cari', 'Bertolette, Daniel C', 'Huang, Ying', 'Ruscetti, Francis W']","['Jones KS', 'Petrow-Sadowski C', 'Bertolette DC', 'Huang Y', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Basic Research Program, SAIC-Frederick, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA. jonesk@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/metabolism/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Virion/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",2005/09/29 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/20/12692 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.20.12692-12702.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Oct;79(20):12692-702. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.20.12692-12702.2005.,,['0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)'],PMC1235841,,,,,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JCOG trials revealed that patients with ATLL had an extremely poor prognosis as compared with other peripheral T-cell lymphomas. A second generation combination chemotherapy including pentostatin (JCOG9109) could not improve the prognosis of patients with aggressive ATLL with the median survival time (MST) of 7.4 months. Subsequently, JCOG developed a new alternating multi-agent chemotherapy including MCNU and carboplatin with prophyractic use of G-CSF, resulting 35% of CR rate and 31% of 2-year OS. Considering the poor prognosis of aggressive ATLL patients, allogeneic stem cell transplantation seems to be another promising approach for a cure of the disease.

All racial and ethnic groups are at risk, and at least 11 complementation groups have been identified and the genes defective in eight of these have been identified (FANCA, C, D2, E, F, G, L and BRCA2). FA-A is the most common complementation group, accounting for approximately 65% of all affected individuals. The gold-standard screening test for FA is based on the characteristic hypersensitivity of FA cells to the crosslinking agents, such as mitomicin C or diepoxybutane. Recent progress has been made in identifying the genes bearing pathogenetically relevant mutations, but slower progress has been made in defining the precise functions of the proteins in normal cells, in part because that the proteins are multifunctional. Molecular studies have established that a common pathway exist, both between the FA proteins and other proteins involved in DNA repair such as NBS1, ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only option for establishing normal hematopoiesis. To reduce undue toxicities due to inherent hypersensitivity, nonmyeloablative conditioning for transplants has been advocated. This review summarizes the general clinical and hematologic features and the current management of FA. Fanconi anemia (FA) is the commonest type of inherited bone marrow failure syndrome with the birth incidence of around three per million. The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive with the estimated heterozygote frequency being one in 300 in Europe and the US.","['Kook, Hoon']",['Kook H'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Blood & Marrow Transplantation Center, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['DNA Repair/genetics', 'Disease Management', '*Fanconi Anemia/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans']",2005/09/29 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['K77007N1614421T6 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330512331390096 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2005;10 Suppl 1:108-10. doi: 10.1080/10245330512331390096.,,['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)'],,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed rapid and sensitive split-signal fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays for frequently occuring chromosome aberrations. The split-signal FISH approach uses two differentially labeled probes, located in one gene at opposite sites of the breakpoint region. In normal karyotypes, two co-localized green/red signals are visible, but a translocation results in a split of one of the co-localized signals. Split-signal FISH has three main advantages over the classical fusion-signal FISH approach, which uses of two labeled probes located in two genes. First, the detection of a chromosome aberration is independent of the involved partner gene. Second, split-signal FISH allows the identification of the partner gene or chromosome region if metaphase spreads are present, and finally it reduces false-positivity.","['van Dongen, J J M', 'van der Burg, M', 'Langerak, A W']","['van Dongen JJ', 'van der Burg M', 'Langerak AW']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.j.m.vandongen@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids']",2005/09/29 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['P528304538041LX3 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330512331389980 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2005;10 Suppl 1:66-72. doi: 10.1080/10245330512331389980.,,['0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)'],,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A full length cDNA of CYP3A5 gene was cloned, and a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid was constructed, then stably transfected cell lines were established. Furthermore, the sensitivity of those cell lines to several anticancer drugs were assessed by MTT and FCM assay. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid was designated as pcDNA3-CYP3A5. Transfecting HL-60 cells (which didn't show transcript of CYP3A5 gene) with recombinant plasmid pcDNA3-CYP3A5 generated HL-60/CYP3A5 cell line, and transfecting of HL-60 cells with the parental pcDNA3 vector served as control HL-60/pc cell line. Daunorubicin induced remarkable apoptosis peaks in HL-60 and HL-60/pc cells, while such effect did not occur in HL-60/CYP3A5 cells (apoptosis cell percentage were 7.3%, 6.3% and 1.2%, respectively). Compared with HL-60 and HL-60/pc cells, HL-60/CYP3A5 cells were statistically significantly resistant to daunorubicin, aclacinomycin A, vincristine and harringtonine (resistance multiples were 2.89, 2.01, 4.05 and 2.79 times, respectively, P < 0.05), however the sensitivity to teniposide didn't change (resistance multiple was 1.04 times). CONCLUSION: Transcription of CYP3A5 gene in leukemia cells directly induces resistance to anthracyclines and alkaloids, however the cells are still sensitive to epipodophyllotoxins. Therefore, our findings confirmed a new mechanism of multidrug resistance.","['Wang, Ting', 'Chen, Fang-yuan', 'Gu, Chun-hong', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Teng, Ye', 'Ouyang, Ren-rong']","['Wang T', 'Chen FY', 'Gu CH', 'Zhong H', 'Teng Y', 'Ouyang RR']","['Department of Hematology, Renji Hospital of Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200001, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,IM,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2005/09/29 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2005 Aug;27(8):461-4.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the role of semaphorins outside of the nervous system has broadened, so has elucidation of the intracellular signalling pathways they initiate. Previously, we and others have shown that plexin-B1 activates RhoA through the binding and activation of RhoGEF (guanine nucleotide-exchange factor)/LARG (leukaemia-associated RhoGEF) in response to semaphorin 4D stimulation.

Both DCs and NK cells are also sensors of the immune system that have developed different, but partially overlapping, systems to identify pathology associated danger signals. Evidence of NK-DC interaction has accumulated recently. This interaction may lead to NK cell activation, DC activation, or apoptosis depending on the activation status of both cell types. Thus, the outcome of NK-DC crosstalk is likely to influence both innate and adaptive immune responses. This review addresses the molecular mechanisms under-lying the different NK-DC interactions, and their in vivo significance in anti-tumour or antimicrobial immunity.

The HHV-6B infected culture proliferated with a constant ratio of infected (1%) to the uninfected (99%) cells. When the IL-2 concentration was reduced to 5 units/ml, the number of infected cells in the culture increased transiently by 60% in 11 days, a new balance of 25% infected cells and 75% uninfected cells was established thereafter. PCR analysis confirmed a 125-fold increase in the amount of viral genome in the culture, while the treatment with ganciclovir reduced the proportion of infected cells, indicating that an efficient replication of virus was induced in the culture. Both of these cultures were maintained in the presence of 20 or 5 units/ml IL-2 over one year without loss of infected cells. Interestingly, we found that cultures containing the infected cells grew significantly faster than the parental uninfected cells at the same concentration of IL-2. The infected culture continued to grow for 7 days even in the absence of IL-2. Because the infection induces cell cycle arrest, these results indicate that the HHV-6B-infected ATL cells stimulate the growth of the uninfected cells during persistent infection in culture.","['Ojima, Tomoko', 'Abe, Kenji', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Shirakata, Masaki', 'Yamamoto, Kohtaro']","['Ojima T', 'Abe K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Shirakata M', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Med Dent Sci,Journal of medical and dental sciences,9717112,IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/drug effects/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/virology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2005/09/29 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Med Dent Sci. 2005 Jun;52(2):135-41.,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood component therapy and a pediatric dosage of ATRA (25 mg/m2/day) combined with idarubicin as induction chemotherapy were administered in the first week, but the bleeding diathesis persisted and DIC profiles showed no improvement. The patient then developed photophobia, neck stiffness, and constant headache. Evidence of increased intracranial pressure (IICP) and persistent bleeding from previous venous puncture sites were also noticed clinically. DIC and life-threatening IICP were beyond control until the ATRA dosage was increased to adult levels (45 mg/m2/day). This case suggests that the ATRA dosage for pediatric APL patients must be modified according to clinical condition. Emergency brain imaging should be considered in APL patients with signs of IICP to distinguish intracranial lesions from ATRA complications.","['Lin, Chien-Hung', 'Hung, Giun-Yi', 'Chang, Chia-Yau', 'Chien, Jen-Chung']","['Lin CH', 'Hung GY', 'Chang CY', 'Chien JC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,IM,"['Child', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications', 'Headache/*etiology', 'Hematoma, Subdural/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects']",2005/09/29 09:00,2005/10/15 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1726-4901(09)70161-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70161-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2005 Sep;68(9):437-40. doi: 10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70161-3.,,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While BLV is difficult to detect in vivo, it is readily produced by cultured lymphocytes and is diminished when supplemented by bovine plasma. This phenomenon is attributed to a poorly characterized plasma blocking factor (PBF). We assessed the effects of bovine plasma on cell viability and BLV p24 expression, and the effects of purified PBF on protein synthesis and gene expression of short-term cultures of bovine lymphocytes. The addition of 25% plasma or semi-purified PBF to cultures had no significant effect on cell viability but caused significant decreases in BLV p24 production and significantly increased de novo protein synthesis. Utilizing a human microarray, the RNA messages of 83 genes involved in cell division, cell metabolism, and gene regulation were up-regulated.","['van den Heuvel, Marianne J', 'Jefferson, Barbara J', 'Jacobs, Robert M']","['van den Heuvel MJ', 'Jefferson BJ', 'Jacobs RM']","['Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph, Ontario. mvandenh@uwo.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/blood/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/virology', 'Plasma/chemistry/*immunology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Viral Core Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",2005/09/29 09:00,2005/11/11 09:00,['2005/09/29 09:00'],"['2005/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 2005 Jul;69(3):186-92.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (blocking factor)', '0 (core protein p24, bovine leukemia virus)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",PMC1176297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is difficult to get satisfying results by using conventional linear statistical methods.

In this paper, we propose a new method to select parameters of the aforementioned algorithm implemented with Gaussian kernel SVMs as better alternatives to the common practice of selecting the apparently best parameters by using a genetic algorithm to search for a couple of optimal parameter. Fast implementation issues for this method are also discussed for pragmatic reasons. The proposed method was tested on two representative hereditary breast cancer and acute leukaemia datasets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs well in selecting genes and achieves high classification accuracies with these genes.","['Mao, Yong', 'Zhou, Xiao-Bo', 'Pi, Dao-Ying', 'Sun, You-Xian', 'Wong, Stephen T C']","['Mao Y', 'Zhou XB', 'Pi DY', 'Sun YX', 'Wong ST']","['National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Modern Control Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. ymao@iipc.zju.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,Journal of Zhejiang University.

Recent data on combinations with rituximab and chemotherapy have shown promise for improving patient outcome. Newer antibodies in development include the primatized monoclonal antibody lumiliximab (IDEC-152), directed against CD23. Other biological approaches include the use of antisense oligonucleotides, proapoptic small molecules, and vaccines directed against the malignant B cells.

High efficacy at low effector-to-target ratios, independence of T cell costimuli and a potent activation of previously unstimulated polyclonal T cells were identified as hallmarks of this class of bispecific antibodies. Here we studied a bispecific single-chain antibody construct (referred to as 'bispecific T cell engager', BiTE) in an immunocompetent mouse model. This was possible by the use of a murine CD3-specific BiTE, and a syngeneic melanoma cell line (B16F10) expressing the human Ep-CAM target. The murine CD3-specific BiTE, called 2C11x4-7 prevented in a dose-dependent fashion the outgrowth of subcutaneously growing B16/Ep-CAM tumors with daily i.v. injections of 5 or 50 microg BiTE which was most effective. Treatment with 2C11x4-7 was effective even when it was started 10 days after tumor cell inoculation but delayed treatments showed a reduction in the number of cured animals. 2C11x4-7 was also highly active in a lung tumor colony model. When treatment was started on the day of intravenous tumor cell injection, seven out of eight animals stayed free of lung tumors, and three out of eight animals when treatment was started on day 5.

Cajal and promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies are discrete nuclear structures with specific molecular signatures. RNA polymerase II and many transcription factors have been identified within these compartments by immunofluorescence microscopy, suggesting a role in polymerase II assembly or transcriptional activity. Here, we have examined the presence of different phosphorylated forms of polymerase II and newly made RNA in Cajal and PML bodies using high-resolution imaging of ultrathin cryosections (approximately 120 nm thick) with fluorescence and electron microscopes. We show that Cajal bodies contain polymerase II phosphorylated on Ser5, and not the Ser2-phosphorylated (active) form or newly made RNA. The presence of polymerase II in the absence of transcriptional activity suggests that Cajal bodies have roles in polymerase assembly or transport, but not in gene transcription. PML bodies contain no detectable polymerase II or nascent RNA in HeLa cells, at the resolution achieved by electron microscopy, but are often surrounded by these markers at distances>25 nm. These results support the view that although PML bodies are present in transcriptionally active areas of the nucleus, they are not generally sites of polymerase II assembly, transport or activity.","['Xie, Sheila Q', 'Pombo, Ana']","['Xie SQ', 'Pombo A']","['MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,IM,"['Antibodies', 'Coiled Bodies/*enzymology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Uridine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2005/09/28 09:00,2006/06/01 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00418-005-0064-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 2006 Jan;125(1-2):21-31. doi: 10.1007/s00418-005-0064-2.

METHODS: Forty-one patients with MDS were the subjects in this retrospective study, and 21 patients with AML were selected as controls. Reviewing their clinical records, we verified that corneal ulcer, iridocyclitis, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, and optic neuritis had been evaluated using slit-lamp assessment and opthalmoscopy in all the patients. In this study, the MDS patients were classified into those with refractory anemia (RA) and those with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). RESULTS: Ocular complications were found in 19 (46.3%) of the 41 patients with MDS, comprising corneal ulcer (two cases), iridocyclitis (five), vitreous hemorrhage (one), retinal hemorrhage (ten), cotton wool spots (one), and optic neuritis (two). (Some patients had more than one ocular complication.) Ocular complications were identified in 12 of the 21 (57.1%) patients with AML. There was no significant difference in frequency of ocular complications between MDS and AML (P = 0.4892). In MDS, retinal hemorrhage was associated with significantly reduced platelet counts (P = 0.0063).

In this study, CD5 expression was investigated in leukemic cells from 42 patients with chronic B cell lymphoproliferative disease. METHODS: We studied the CD5 expression in leukemic cells from 42 patients with chronic B-cell malignancies by flow cytometry. Demographic features such as age, sex and clinical date were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were 22 males and 20 females. The immunophenotyping showed that 35 cases were B-CLL, 3 B-PLL and HCL and one patient was MCL. CD5 expression was present in all B-CLL and MCL. Low expression of CD5 was observed in one patient with B-PLL and negative in all cases of HCL.

Oncolytic viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have recently emerged as a potential treatment of solid tumors and leukemias in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we investigated the ability of VSV to lyse primary human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected T-lymphocytes from patients with ATL. Ex vivo primary ATL cells were permissive for VSV and underwent rapid oncolysis in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, VSV infection showed neither viral replication nor oncolysis in HTLV-1-infected, nonleukemic cells from patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and in naive CD4(+) T-lymphocytes from normal individuals or in ex vivo cell samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Interestingly, activation of primary CD4(+) T-lymphocytes with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody, and specifically with anti-CD3, was sufficient to induce limited viral replication and oncolysis. However, at a similar level of T-cell activation, VSV replication was increased fourfold in ATL cells compared to activated CD4(+) T-lymphocytes, emphasizing the concept that VSV targets genetic defects unique to tumor cells to facilitate its replication.

We show here that cotreatment of K562 cells with PMA and low doses of SB202190 (SB), an inhibitor of the p38 MAPK pathway, induced a majority of cells to differentiate towards the megakaryocytic lineage. Electronic microscopy analysis showed that K562 cells treated with PMA+SB exhibited characteristic features of physiological megakaryocytic differentiation including the presence of vacuoles and demarcation membranes. Differentiation was also accompanied by a net increase in megakaryocytic markers and a reduction of erythroid markers, especially when both effectors were present. PMA effect was selectively mediated by new PKC isoforms. Differentiation of K562 cells by the combination of PMA and SB required Erk1/2 activation, a threshold of JNK activation and p38 MAPK inhibition. Interestingly, higher concentrations of SB, which drastically activated JNK, blocked megakaryocytic differentiation, and considerably increased cell death in the presence of PMA. c-DNA microarray membranes and PCR analysis allow us to identify a set of genes modulated during PMA-induced K562 cell differentiation. Several gene families identified in our screening, including ephrins receptors and some angiogenic factors, had never been reported so far to be regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Jacquel, A', 'Herrant, M', 'Defamie, V', 'Belhacene, N', 'Colosetti, P', 'Marchetti, S', 'Legros, L', 'Deckert, M', 'Mari, B', 'Cassuto, J-P', 'Hofman, P', 'Auberger, P']","['Jacquel A', 'Herrant M', 'Defamie V', 'Belhacene N', 'Colosetti P', 'Marchetti S', 'Legros L', 'Deckert M', 'Mari B', 'Cassuto JP', 'Hofman P', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U526, Physiopathologie de la Survie et de la Mort Cellulaires, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Universite de Nice Sophia-Antipolis, IFR50, Faculte de Medecine, Avenue de Valombrose, 06107 Nice Cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2005/09/28 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209119 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209119 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Feb 2;25(5):781-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209119.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lck, a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, plays a key role in T-lymphocyte activation and differentiation. However, under certain conditions Lck is also involved in the induction of apoptosis. In this issue of Oncogene, Samraj et al. used the Lck-defective JCaM1.6 cell line to demonstrate the critical role of Lck in the apoptotic response of T-cell leukemia cells to several chemotherapeutic drugs. They further showed that Lck controls the mitochondrial death pathway by regulating proapoptotic Bak expression. This chemosensitizing effect of Lck is independent of T-cell receptor signaling and does not require the kinase activity of Lck. These findings demonstrate that Lck might be part of two independent signaling pathways leading to either cell proliferation or apoptosis, and reveal a hitherto unrecognized link between Lck, Bak, and chemosensitivity of human leukemic cells.","['Heyninck, K', 'Beyaert, R']","['Heyninck K', 'Beyaert R']","['Department for Molecular Biomedical Research, Unit of Molecular Signal Transduction in Inflammation, VIB, Ghent University, Technologiepark, B-9052, Gent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*biosynthesis/drug effects']",2005/09/28 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209157 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209157 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Mar 16;25(12):1693-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209157.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",,20,,,,,,,['Oncogene. 2006 Jan 12;25(2):186-97.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred sixty-seven patients who were diagnosed as having de novo MDS at the Division of Hematology, University of Pavia (Pavia, Italy), between 1992 and 2002, were evaluated retrospectively for clinical and hematologic features at diagnosis, overall survival (OS), and progression to leukemia (leukemia-free survival). RESULTS: Significant differences in survival were noted between patients with refractory anemia (RA), refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, RA with excess blasts, type 1 (RAEB-1), and RAEB-2. The effect of demographic factors on OS was observed in MDS patients without excess blasts (age, P = .001; sex, P = .006), as in the general population. The mortality of RA patients 70 years or older did not differ significantly from that of the general population (SMR, 1.62; P = .06). Cytogenetics was the only International Prognostic Scoring System variable showing a prognostic value in MDS classified into WHO subgroups. Transfusion-dependent patients had a significantly shorter survival than patients who did not require transfusions (P < .001). Developing a secondary iron overload significantly affected the survival of transfusion-dependent patients (P = .003). CONCLUSION: These data show that the WHO classification of MDSs has a relevant prognostic value. This classification, along with cytogenetics, might be useful in decisions regarding transplantation. MDS with isolated erythroid lineage dysplasia identifies a subset of truly low-risk patients, for whom a conservative approach is advisable.","['Malcovati, Luca', 'Porta, Matteo Giovanni Della', 'Pascutto, Cristiana', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Boni, Marina', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Passamonti, Francesco', 'Arcaini, Luca', 'Maffioli, Margherita', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Malcovati L', 'Porta MG', 'Pascutto C', 'Invernizzi R', 'Boni M', 'Travaglino E', 'Passamonti F', 'Arcaini L', 'Maffioli M', 'Bernasconi P', 'Lazzarino M', 'Cazzola M']","['Division of Hematology, IRCCS, Policlinico San Matteo, 27100 Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Decision Making', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/09/28 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.01.7038 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.01.7038 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 20;23(30):7594-603. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.7038.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had relapsed or refractory CLL after treatment with fludarabine. Oblimersen was administered at doses ranging from 3 to 7 mg/kg/d as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion in cycle 1 and as a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion in subsequent cycles every 3 weeks in stable or responding patients. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled and treated (14 patients in phase I and 26 patients in phase II). Dose-limiting reactions in phase I included hypotension and fever, and the MTD for phase II dosing was established at 3 mg/kg/d. Two (8%) of 26 assessable patients achieved a partial response. Other evidence of antitumor activity included > or = 50% reduction in splenomegaly (seven of 17 patients; 41%), complete disappearance of hepatomegaly (two of seven patients; 29%), > or = 50% reduction of lymphadenopathy (seven of 22 patients; 32%), and > or = 50% reduction in circulating lymphocyte counts (11 of 22 patients; 50%). Adverse events included transient hypotension, fever, fatigue, night sweats, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypokalemia, and cough. Plasma concentrations of oblimersen (parent drug) and its major metabolites were variable. Renal clearance represented only a small portion of total parent drug clearance. CONCLUSION: Dosing with oblimersen sodium in patients with CLL is limited by development of a cytokine release syndrome that is characterized by fever, hypotension, and back pain. Oblimersen sodium has modest single-agent activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced CLL, and further evaluation of its activity in combination with cytotoxic drugs is warranted.","[""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Cunningham, Charles C', 'Golenkov, Anatoliy K', 'Turkina, Anna G', 'Novick, Steven C', 'Rai, Kanti R']","[""O'Brien SM"", 'Cunningham CC', 'Golenkov AK', 'Turkina AG', 'Novick SC', 'Rai KR']","['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030-7305, USA. sobrien@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2005/09/28 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.4364 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.4364 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 20;23(30):7697-702. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.4364.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 472 patients who achieved CR1, 182 (38%) had an HLA-identical sibling (donor group), and alloSCT was performed in 171 patients (94%). Of the 290 patients without donor (no-donor group), 62% received an autologous SCT. RESULTS: In an intent-to-treat analysis based on donor availability, the overall 10-year survival probability was 51% v 43% (P = .11) for the donor and no-donor groups, respectively. A Cox analysis determined that four factors had independent prognostic significance for survival (initial WBC count, French-American-British subtypes, cytogenetic risk, and number of induction courses). This permitted constitution of a simple index that reclassified 21% of the patients compared with usual cytogenetic classification and identified three subpopulations with different outcome and different impact of alloSCT. CONCLUSION: AlloSCT was associated with a survival advantage for an intermediate-risk group. In other groups, numbers are limited for definitive conclusion. However, early performed alloSCT does not seem to be the optimal treatment of high-risk patients or offer any advantage over intensive chemotherapy in low-risk patients.","['Jourdan, Eric', 'Boiron, Jean-Michel', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Marit, Gerald', 'Rigal-Huguet, Francoise', 'Molina, Lysiane', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Recher, Christian', 'Rossi, Jean-Francois', 'Attal, Michel', 'Sotto, Jean-Jacques', 'Maraninchi, Dominique', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Bardou, Valerie-Jeanne', 'Esterni, Benjamin', 'Blaise, Didier']","['Jourdan E', 'Boiron JM', 'Dastugue N', 'Vey N', 'Marit G', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Molina L', 'Fegueux N', 'Pigneux A', 'Recher C', 'Rossi JF', 'Attal M', 'Sotto JJ', 'Maraninchi D', 'Reiffers J', 'Bardou VJ', 'Esterni B', 'Blaise D']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Caremeau, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU), Nimes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/28 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.5940 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.5940 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 20;23(30):7676-84. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.5940.

Many associations have been described between individual antigen expression on myeloid blasts and prognosis, however few are consistent. Markers with a consistent prognostic association that have been demonstrated in more than one study have been CD13, CD14, and CD15. The association of the expression of CD11b with poor prognosis appears definite, as does CD7 expression. When compared with the expression of a single antigen, a pattern of antigen expression is likely to have a more significant relationship to prognosis. This is exemplified by the panmyeloid phenotype (expression of 5 myeloid antigens) which appears to be associated with a good prognosis and may differentiate a subgroup within an otherwise intermediate prognosis group of patients. Further analysis with the inclusion of novel antibodies and the combination of multiple antibodies to create further subgroups such as the panmyeloid phenotype will continue to enhance knowledge in this area.","['Mason, Kylie D', 'Juneja, Surender K', 'Szer, Jeff']","['Mason KD', 'Juneja SK', 'Szer J']","['Department of Diagnostic Haematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Grattan St, Parkville, Vic, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prognosis']",2005/09/28 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)00042-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2005.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2006 Mar;20(2):71-82. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2005.08.002.

We have shown that all of these newly synthesized anthracycline derivatives inhibit human leukemia K562 cell line proliferation but only some of them induce erythroid differentiation when used at subtoxic concentrations. Morpholine derivative of DOX has the greatest potential to inhibit proliferation and to induce differentiation in vitro. The correlation between these two cellular processes was also significant for other tested compounds. In cell cycle analysis, we have demonstrated that those anthracycline derivatives that exert the greatest cytostatic potential caused G(2)/M arrest, which in turn, might contribute to the development of a differentiating phenotype. The concentrations of the compounds used in the study are pharmacologically relevant.

METHODS: VEGF mRNA expression was analysed by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. VEGF level of culture supernatant of the bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNC) was detected by ELISA. The influence of culture supernatant of the BMMNC on proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell line huECV304 in vitro was determined by MTT assay. RESULTS: The median VEGF/beta-actin expression level of BMMNC in newly diagnosed untreated AL group was higher (0.86) than that in remission group (0.41) and normal control group (0.39) (P < 0.01, both), but was no difference from the relapse group (1.02, P > 0.05). Among the patients with newly diagnosed untreated AL, VEGF/beta-actin level in AML (1.03) was statistically higher than that in ALL (0.61) (P < 0.05). The VEGF level in 72 h culture supernatant of BMMNC was higher in newly diagnosed untreated AL group (91.48 ng/L) than in remission group (31.91 ng/L) and normal control group (28.71 ng/L) (P < 0.01).

RESULTS: The diabody was produced in E.coli in a soluble functional form and could bind both Jurkat cells (CD3(+)) and K562/A02 cells (Pgp(+)). The binding rates were 86.25% and 86.26%, respectively. It could inhibit tumor growth by 98.57% and prolonged the survival of mice bearing xenografted K562/A02 cells. CONCLUSION: The diabody was proved to be a potent agent for mediating T lymphocyte cytotoxicity to lyse Pgp expressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.","['Gao, Ying-dai', 'Xiong, Dong-sheng', 'Yang, Ming', 'Xu, Yuan-fu', 'Shao, Xiao-feng', 'Peng, Hui', 'Fan, Dong-mei', 'Yang, Chun-zheng']","['Gao YD', 'Xiong DS', 'Yang M', 'Xu YF', 'Shao XF', 'Peng H', 'Fan DM', 'Yang CZ']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/*pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/09/28 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jun;26(6):342-4.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Genomic DNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells of 143 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 25 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 2 acute hybrid leukemia (AHL), 17 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 7 chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis for FLT3-TKD point mutations. RESULTS: Among AML patients, FLT3-TKD point mutation (FLT3-TKD(+)) rate was 6.3% (9/143), an incidence significantly lower than that of internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation (37/143, 25.9%, P < 0.01). According to the FAB classification, FLT3-TKD point mutation was found in 3/53 of M(2), 3/40 of M(3), 2/23 of M(5) and 1/2 of M(6) subtypes. Two patients showed both ITD and TKD mutations. No FLT3-TDK mutation was found in 25 ALL, 2 AHL, 17 MDS and 7 CML-BC patients. Sequence analysis showed that one of the mutations occurred at codon 835 of FLT3. The substitution of the first nucleotide T for G of D835, resulted in D835Y, a missense mutation. The presence of TKD mutations was related neither to age, sex, nor to WBC counts, the marrow blast percentages, and CR rates for induction therapy. CONCLUSION The incidence of FLT3-TKD(+) is significantly lower than that of ITD mutation. FLT3-TKD mutations may occur alone or together with ITD mutation. In contrast to FLT3-ITD mutation, TKD mutations were not associated with leukocytosis or low complete remission rate.","['Wang, Li-hong', 'Wang, Min', 'Zhou, Chun-lin', 'Chen, Sen', 'Zhang, Xin-wei', 'Xing, Hai-yan', 'Wang, Jian-xiang']","['Wang LH', 'Wang M', 'Zhou CL', 'Chen S', 'Zhang XW', 'Xing HY', 'Wang JX']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Clinical Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2005/09/28 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jun;26(6):335-8.,,['EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts were detected by combined RT-PCR with sequencing. Transcription assays were examined using pM-CSFR-Luc as reporting plasmid, and subcellular localization of encoding proteins were assayed by double immunofluorescent staining and Western blot. RESULTS: Two types of CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts were found in 26 patients with acute leukemia, most being of type A (23/26 cases, 92%) and a few of type D (2/26 cases, 8%). The inhibition of CBF-mediated M-CSFR promotor transactivation by CBFbeta/SMHHC fusion protein was increasing with the increase in amount of the fusion protein. CBFalpha subunit (AML1) located in nucleus, both CBFbeta subunit (CBFbeta) and CBFbeta/SMHHC located in cytoplasm. When AML1 and CBFbeta were coexpressed, CBFbeta still located mainly in cytoplasm, but when AML1 and CBFbeta/SMHHC were coexpressed, CBFbeta/SMHHC located mainly in nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The types of CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcripts of Chinese leukemia patients are almost the same as that reported in western literature. (2) CBFbeta/SMHHC inhibits CBF-mediated transactivation through competing with CBFbeta for binding to AML1.","['Xu, Shi-cai', 'Yang, Lin', 'Zhou, Xu', 'Feng, Min', 'Hao, Yu-shu', 'Xiao, Zhi-jian']","['Xu SC', 'Yang L', 'Zhou X', 'Feng M', 'Hao YS', 'Xiao ZJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/09/28 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jun;26(6):332-5.,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
