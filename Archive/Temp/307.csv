During a 5-year follow-up study, 1,661 consecutive CSF samples from 113 children with a TdT+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 100), a TdT+ acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) (n = 8), or a TdT+ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n = 5) were analyzed. In 1,511 (91.9%) of 1,643 evaluable CSF samples, the positive and negative findings of both cytomorphology and the TdT-IF assay were concordant. In 47 (2.9%) samples from 28 patients, the cytomorphology was suspect while the TdT-IF assay was negative; follow-up as long as 58 months revealed no CNS leukemia in any patient. In 85 (5.2%) samples, cytomorphology was negative (n = 70) or suspect (n = 15) but TdT+ cells were detected. RBC contamination seriously hampered evaluation in 31 of these 85 samples. From the remaining 54 TdT+ samples from 29 patients, 40 samples preceded overt CNS leukemia in 20 patients. Two consecutive findings of TdT+ cells in the CSF were always followed by overt CNS leukemia. At initial diagnosis, 11 children had TdT+ cells in their RBC-free CSF. In one of these children, morphology was suspect; a repeated lumbar puncture was positive on both assays. Thus, initial CNS leukemia was diagnosed. In the other ten children, morphology was negative. In six of them, CNS leukemia was diagnosed 2 to 20 months later. In 32 other children examined at initial diagnosis, neither TdT+ cells nor blasts were observed in the CSF. In none of these patients was a CNS leukemia diagnosed after a follow-up of 2.5 to 57 months (median 24 months). In 207 control CSF samples from 58 children with TdT- oncologic, hematologic, or infectious diseases, no TdT+ cells could be detected. The TdT-IF assay is easy to perform and is a more reliable diagnostic tool for detection of CNS leukemia at an early stage than is cytomorphology. At initial diagnosis, the finding of Tdt+ cells in a RBC-free CSF sample with a negative cytomorphology is highly predictive for development of overt CNS leukemia.","['Hooijkaas, H', 'Hahlen, K', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'Dekker, I', 'van Zanen, G E', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Hooijkaas H', 'Hahlen K', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'Dekker I', 'van Zanen GE', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*enzymology', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77370-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):416-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty cases (10%) with abnormalities of 9p were identified: 26 with deletions, nine with unbalanced translocations resulting in the loss of 9p material, and five with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations. As compared with children with ALL lacking 9p abnormalities, these 40 cases were significantly older, had higher initial circulating WBC counts, more ""lymphomatous"" disease characteristics (including presence of a mediastinal mass in 15%. T-cell phenotype in 26%, splenomegaly greater than 8 cm in 25%), an increased failure rate in the first 2 to 3 years after diagnosis, and a higher incidence of extramedullary relapse. Conversely, lymphomatous ALL cases were twice as likely (19% v 8%) to have an abnormality of chromosome 9p than ALL cases lacking lymphomatous features (P = .01). The finding of an abnormal chromosome 9p, however, was not specific for lymphomatous ALL or T-cell lineage, because most cases were neither lymphomatous nor T-cell, and the overall Kaplan-Meier distribution of treatment failures for abnormal 9p cases was not statistically significantly different from control ALL cases receiving the same treatment who lacked abnormalities of 9p (P = .06, by log-rank test). We conclude that nonrandom abnormalities of chromosome 9p, especially a breakpoint in 9p21-22, occur with increased frequency in childhood ALL in association with some high-risk clinical features. Despite this association, the chromosome anomaly is nonspecific in its syndrome delineation and confers no major adverse consequence on long-term survival of childhood ALL treated with modern therapy. However, due to an apparently increased hazard of involvement of the CNS (eight of 17 failures), it may be inadvisable to lessen the intensity of CNS preventive therapy for this group of patients.","['Murphy, S B', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Rivera, G K', 'Crone, M', 'Dodge, R K', 'Behm, F G', 'Pui, C H', 'Williams, D L']","['Murphy SB', 'Raimondi SC', 'Rivera GK', 'Crone M', 'Dodge RK', 'Behm FG', 'Pui CH', 'Williams DL']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77369-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):409-15.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-one patient and disease characteristics at onset of 370 patients with MDS were analyzed to identify significant prognostic factors for survival and transformation to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and to develop and validate a regression model for predicting survival. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the total bone marrow percentage of blast cells, age, platelet count, WBC count, and hemoglobin level were the characteristics more significantly associated with survival in the overall series. The bone marrow percentage of type I blast cells was the most important factor predicting transformation into AML. Proportional hazards regression analysis in a randomly selected training sample of 240 patients demonstrated that the combination of total bone marrow percentage of blast cells, platelet count, and age had the strongest predictive relation to survival length. The resulting regression models, continuous and categorized, were validated in the remaining test sample of 130 patients by demonstrating its capability of segregating patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with distinctively different survival curves (P less than .0001). A scoring system derived from the categorized model also had a great prognostic value (P less than .0001).

Thirteen neutral GSL bands were detected at Rf.03 through .64 (CHCl3-CH3OH-H2O, 65:25:4) after extraction and chromatography (DEAE-Sephadex and Bio-sil A). Both IgM and IgG serum antibody binding was determined for 50 subjects from four groups: normal blood donors (NBD, n = 18); leukemia patients with nonimmune thrombocytopenia (NIT, n = 10); patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 10); and patients with chronic autoimmune thrombocytopenia (CATP, n = 12). The ABO typing of these 50 subjects also allowed correlation of serum antibody binding with A blood group antigen expression. These studies reveal: (1) anti-GSL binding at band .06 is associated with blood group A alloantigen expression for both IgG and IgM (P less than .0001) antibodies; (2) binding at bands .17, .27, and/or .46 is associated with general autoimmunity (SLE and CATP) for IgM (P less than .0001); (3) binding at bands .35 and/or .38 is associated with platelet-specific autoimmunity (CATP) for IgG and/or IgM (P less than .005); and (4) binding at bands .03, .20, .23, and/or .43 is frequently observed for sera from all groups. The platelet specificity of bands .35 and .38 was confirmed by comparative studies with human intestinal smooth muscle GSLs. Quantitation of the intensity of CATP-associated anti-GSL binding (86 +/- 88 mm2) is comparable to anti-A alloantigen binding (57 +/- 52 mm2). Two of the GSL bands associated with SLE and CATP appear to be the long-chain fatty-acyl forms of globotriaosyl ceramide (.27) and globotetraosyl ceramide (.17), which are the Pk and P blood group antigens, respectively.

Marine inspectors and noninspectors had a deficit in overall mortality compared to that expected from the general U.S. population (standardized mortality ratios [SMRs = 79 and 63, respectively]). Deficits occurred for most major causes of death, including infectious and parasitic diseases, digestive and urinary systems, and accidents. Marine inspectors had excesses of cirrhosis of the liver (SMR = 136) and motor vehicle accidents (SMR = 107), and cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system (SMR = 157), whereas noninspectors had deficits for these causes of death. Comparison of mortality rates directly adjusted to the age distribution of the inspectors and noninspectors combined also demonstrated that mortality for these causes of death was greater among inspectors than noninspectors (directly adjusted ratio ratios of 190, 145, and 198) for cirrhosis of the liver, motor vehicle accidents, and lymphatic and hematopoietic system cancer, respectively. The SMRs rose with increasing probability of exposure to chemicals for motor vehicle accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, and leukemia, which suggests that contact with chemicals during inspection of merchant vessels may be involved in the development of these diseases among marine inspectors.","['Blair, A', 'Haas, T', 'Prosser, R', 'Morrissette, M', 'Blackman, K', 'Grauman, D', 'van Dusen, P', 'Moran, F']","['Blair A', 'Haas T', 'Prosser R', 'Morrissette M', 'Blackman K', 'Grauman D', 'van Dusen P', 'Moran F']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Environ Health,Archives of environmental health,0212627,,IM,"['Accidents, Traffic/mortality', 'Adult', '*Cause of Death', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/mortality', 'Ships']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00039896.1989.9935879 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Environ Health. 1989 May-Jun;44(3):150-6. doi: 10.1080/00039896.1989.9935879.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest serum concentration of Ara-C was obtained at 15 min after subcutaneous injection of Ara-C; thereafter the Ara-C concentration decreased immediately within 60 min in a pattern similar to that observed in patients without liver cirrhosis.

In a few cases , whom we were able to follow up the clinical course, we could detect the early relapse in advance to morphological diagnosis and identify the ""recruitment"" of leukemic cells with the use of DA as a tumor marker. With regards to the prognosis of patients, DA was found to be useful as an unfavorable prognostic factor in ANLL (p less than 0.01) as well as in CML-BC (0.05).

After successful remission induction with single-agent chemotherapy (VM-26) and subsequent sustained remission for 12 months with alternating VM-26 and VP-16-213, lineage switch to ALL (FAB L1) occurred. The presence of both lymphoid and myeloid markers on leukemic cells at lineage switch suggested the biphenotypic character of the patient's ALL.

They are not the analyses used to present the data in the original report, but we believe that they are reasonable analyses, suggested by the study's own measurement data, earlier published findings, and consideration of the likely sources of chronic residential magnetic field exposure among adults in the Washington State locale. If the association of magnetic field exposure with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia indicated by the analyses in table 1 is causal (and that is an important ""if""), then the data suggest that some 25 per cent or more of these cases in the Washington State locale could be attributable to chronic magnetic field exposure--and that would obviously be a very important consequence. The risk, if real, is not trivial. And since protection from some important sources of exposure (such as electric bed heaters) is easily obtained, it seems hard to find any justification for not pursuing further studies of this subject immediately and vigorously.","['Wertheimer, N', 'Leeper, E']","['Wertheimer N', 'Leeper E']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bedding and Linens', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', '*Magnetics', 'Research Design', 'Time Factors', 'Washington']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115351 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1989 Aug;130(2):423-7. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115351.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two vaccines were estimated to contain approximately the same amount of gp70 antigen and the cats were immunized three times according to the recommendations of the commercial vaccine. A control preparation not containing gp70 or p15E was also included. During the observation period of 200 days all cats remained healthy and no virus was isolated during the isolation attempts. The serological responses were measured in ELISA, membrane immunofluorescence (MIF) and virus neutralization (VN) tests. In contrast to the cats in the other groups almost all ISCOM-vaccinated cats responded by seroconversion or increased titres in the three tests. The development of specific antibodies to gp70 and p15E were confirmed in Western blot.

The same locus was shown subsequently to be coamplified with c-myc and to be involved in chromosomal translocations in a variety of human and animal neoplasms. Provirus integration in Mlvi-1 in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat T-cell lymphomas activates the c-myc protooncogene. The studies reported here were aimed to determine whether, in addition to the activation of c-myc, provirus integration affected the expression of other neighboring genes. Provirus integration was shown to occur in three clusters separated by regions of uninterrupted DNA. The proviruses in all three clusters had integrated in a single-transcriptional orientation, and they appeared intact. Systematic hybridization of Mlvi-1 clones to rat, mouse, and human genomic DNA revealed three patches of evolutionarily conserved sequences. Two of them were mapped in regions targeted by the provirus, and the third was mapped immediately 5' to the provirus clusters. A probe derived from the conserved sequences 5' of the integrated proviruses detected a tumor-specific RNA transcript in tumors carrying a provirus in Mlvi-1 or in the neighboring Mlvi-4 and c-myc loci. The highest level of RNA transcript expression, however, was seen in a CD4+ CD8+ tumor cell line that was not carrying a provirus in this region. We conclude that provirus insertion in this region activates both c-myc and another gene that is located in the immediate vicinity of the integrated Mlvi-1 proviruses and may be developmentally regulated in T cells.","['Tsichlis, P N', 'Shepherd, B M', 'Bear, S E']","['Tsichlis PN', 'Shepherd BM', 'Bear SE']","['Department of Medicine, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Biological Evolution', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Restriction Mapping']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.14.5487 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Jul;86(14):5487-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.14.5487.,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC297648,,,,,,,,,

To identify regulatory factors that might be responsible for this variability, we investigated how cytosolic fractions affect mRNA decay in an in vitro system. A 130,000 X g supernatant (S130) from the cytosol of exponentially growing erythroleukemia cells contains a destabilizer that accelerates the decay of polysome-bound c-myc mRNA by eightfold or more compared with reactions lacking S130. The destabilizer is deficient in or absent from the S130 of cycloheximide-treated cells, indicating that it is labile or is repressed when translation is blocked. It is not a generic RNase, because it does not affect the turnover of delta-globin, gamma-globin, or histone mRNA and does not destabilize a major portion of polysomal polyadenylated mRNA. The destabilizer accelerates the turnover of the c-myc mRNA 3' region, as well as subsequent 3'-to-5' degradation of the mRNA body. It is inactivated in vitro by mild heating and by micrococcal nuclease, suggesting that it contains a nucleic acid component. c-myb mRNA is also destabilized in S130-supplemented in vitro reactions.

Alternative chimeric oncogenes are formed by splicing different sets of BCR gene exons on chromosome 22 across the translocation breakpoint to a common set of ABL oncogene sequences on chromosome 9. This results in an 8.7-kilobase mRNA that encodes the P210 BCR-ABL gene product commonly found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or a 7.0-kilobase mRNA that produces the P185 BCR-ABL gene product found in most Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. To compare the efficiency of growth stimulation by these two proteins, we derived cDNA clones for each with identical 5' and 3' untranslated regions and expressed them from retrovirus vectors. Matched stocks were compared for potency to transform immature B-lymphoid lineage precursors. The growth-stimulating effects of P185 for this cell type were found to be significantly greater than those of P210. Structural changes in BCR may regulate the effectiveness of the ABL tyrosine kinase function, as monitored by lymphocyte growth response. Changes in mitogenic potency may help to explain the more acute leukemic presentation usually associated with expression of the P185 BCR-ABL oncogene.","['McLaughlin, J', 'Chianese, E', 'Witte, O N']","['McLaughlin J', 'Chianese E', 'Witte ON']","['Department of Microbiology, University of California, Los Angeles 90024-1570.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Exons', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.5.1866-1874.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 May;9(5):1866-74. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.5.1866-1874.1989.,,,PMC362977,,,,,,,,,

The mean values obtained for each parameter for each disease group were compared statistically. In disorders in which the cells have villous cytoplasmic projections, the quantitative analysis of the cellular features was helpful to characterise the different types of B cells involved.

The morphometric findings provided an objective morphological basis for the differential diagnosis between these closely related B-cell leukemias which was further supported by differences in the cells immunophenotype.","['Robinson, D', 'Lackie, P', 'Aber, V', 'Catovsky, D']","['Robinson D', 'Lackie P', 'Aber V', 'Catovsky D']","['Histochemistry Department, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Chromatin)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleolus/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90075-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(5):357-65. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90075-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The previously reported immunosuppression mediated by the peptide CKS-17 was confirmed and further localized to a sequence of eight residues essentially identical to the sequence present in the transmembrane protein gp21 of human T-lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II). To substantiate the physiological relevance of the inhibition of lymphoproliferation observed with the synthetic peptides and to relate this activity to the intact protein, we purified the Rauscher murine leukemia virus transmembrane protein p15E by immunoaffinity chromatography and report that this purified component presented in the form of protein micelles inhibited the interleukin-2-dependent proliferation of the murine T-cell line CTLL-2 in a dose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal inhibitory dose (ID50) of approximately 16 nM. In comparison, the ID50 concentration of a recombinant form of p15E required to inhibit lymphoproliferation was approximately 2.2 microM. The results reported here support the hypothesis that the transmembrane protein gp21 of HTLV-I and -II participates in the mechanism of immunosuppression previously reported for the transmembrane proteins of feline leukemia virus and other animal retroviruses. Thus, the transmembrane protein of HTLV-I, the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, may be partially responsible for the immunocompromised clinical course of this disease that results in fatal opportunistic infections in a majority of cases.","['Ruegg, C L', 'Monell, C R', 'Strand, M']","['Ruegg CL', 'Monell CR', 'Strand M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (virus structural protein p15)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Products, env', '*Gene Products, gag', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Rauscher Virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.8.3250-3256.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Aug;63(8):3250-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.8.3250-3256.1989.,"['CA-09243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC250895,,,,,,,,,

It is rapidly phosphorylated (15 to 30 min) in response to TPA treatment as an early event in a sequence that leads to cessation of cell proliferation and to differentiation of promyelocytes into monocytes. In our study we examined the expression of prosolin in human peripheral lymphocytes and investigated the effects of TPA treatment on prosolin phosphorylation and on lymphocyte proliferation. Prosolin was not expressed in resting PBL but was induced after 24 to 36 h of PHA stimulation, simultaneously with induction of DNA synthesis. In rapidly proliferating (IL-2 dependent) PBL prosolin was a major cytosolic component, comprising 0.5% of total cytosolic protein, of which approximately 28% was phosphorylated. Expression of prosolin decreased again when either mitogen-induced or IL-2-dependent proliferation diminished during extended periods in culture. Thus, expression of prosolin is correlated with periods when PBL are cycling through S-phase. TPA treatment of IL-2-dependent PBL at the peak of their growth caused phosphorylation of about two-thirds of preexisting unphosphorylated prosolin within 1 h. This was accompanied by cessation of cell proliferation, as indicated by measurements of TdR incorporation. Although TPA has well known mitogenic effects in lymphocytes during initial activation, this result shows that it exerts an antiproliferative effect in rapidly dividing PBL. It is suggested that increased phosphorylation of prosolin may be an initiating event in the antiproliferative response to TPA, which would occur only in proliferating lymphocytes expressing prosolin.","['Cooper, H L', 'McDuffie, E', 'Braverman, R']","['Cooper HL', 'McDuffie E', 'Braverman R']","['Cell and Molecular Physiology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytosol/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 1;143(3):956-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very little is known about the therapeutic potential of anti-Id antibodies in animals and men. In this study we explored the combination of anti-Id and chemotherapy in a murine tumor system for which we had previously generated protective anti-Id mAb. First, we investigated various protocols by using a protective anti-Id in active immunization. Mice preimmunized before tumor transfer and challenged again after tumor survived significantly longer. Next, we explored the use of soluble anti-Id as immunostimulator in tumor-bearing mice. Although this treatment did not induce long-term survival, it significantly increased survival time. Interestingly, this anti-Id effect was dose dependent, whereby large and small doses had no effect. Finally, stimulatory anti-Id therapy and cyclophosphamide (Cy) treatment was combined. Tumor bearing mice were given a single dose of Cy followed by different doses of soluble anti-Id. The optimal effect on tumor growth and survival was achieved with 80 mg/kg Cy and 10 micrograms/mouse of anti-Id, where 80% of mice survived longer than 100 days. These results provide guidelines for developing clinical protocols for cancer patients by using combination therapy of anti-Id and chemotherapy.","['Chen, J J', 'Saeki, Y', 'Shi, L F', 'Kohler, H']","['Chen JJ', 'Saeki Y', 'Shi LF', 'Kohler H']","['Department of Microbiology, State University of New York, Buffalo 14214.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)', 'FV4Y0JO2CX (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Hemocyanins/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Aug 1;143(3):1053-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nakagawa, and N. Sadakane. 1979. Tetrahedron Lett. 1979: 4323-4326). Recent studies have shown that the antibiotic not only inhibits the phosphorylation of p60src in Rous sarcoma virus- (RSV) infected cells, but also reverses the cellular phenotypes acquired by transfection with tyrosine kinase oncogenes (Uehara, Y., M. Hori, T. Takeuchi, and H. Umezawa. 1985. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 76:672-675; Uehara, Y., M. Hori, T. Takeuchi, and H. Umezawa. 1986. Mol. Cell. Biol. 6: 2198-2206; Uehara, Y., Y. Murakami, S. Mizuno, and S. Kawai. 1988. Virology. 164: 294-298). These studies and other evidence indicate that the antibiotic inhibits a reaction(s) closely associated with the function of cellular tyrosine kinases. We have found that herbimycin A is an effective inducing agent capable of triggering differentiation in two typical mouse in vitro differentiation systems, which have been considered to be quite different in their mechanism of induction: endoderm differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (F9) cells and terminal erythroid differentiation of erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The results suggest that there is a common step in the intracellular differentiation cascade which is, directly or indirectly, associated with phosphorylation at specific (tyrosine) residues of cellular proteins. The significance of this finding with respect to the molecular mechanism of in vitro differentiation is discussed.","['Kondo, K', 'Watanabe, T', 'Sasaki, H', 'Uehara, Y', 'Oishi, M']","['Kondo K', 'Watanabe T', 'Sasaki H', 'Uehara Y', 'Oishi M']","['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/genetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasminogen Activators/biosynthesis', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Teratoma/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.109.1.285 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1989 Jul;109(1):285-93. doi: 10.1083/jcb.109.1.285.,,,PMC2115494,,,,,,,,,

This last parameter was the only variable that was also significantly associated with an increased risk of fatal hemorrhage for the following week (p less than 0.005).

HL-60 cells are much more sensitive than K562 cells to the cytotoxic effects of ET-18-OCH3 and, at the same time, they contain nearly twice as much ether lipid as the more resistant K562 cells. These observations suggested a relation between the cellular ether-lipid content and sensitivity to ET-18-OCH3. Further evidence linking these properties was obtained when the ether-lipid content of K562 cells was increased by incubating them in medium containing 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycerol.

Sequence-dependent activity was observed, inasmuch as the IFN-alpha pretreatment sequence was antagonistic, while the other schedules were additive or, possibly, synergistic. The combination of 0.5 microM 6-TG and 100 IU/ml IFN-alpha produced the same level of HL-60 cell differentiation as each agent alone, suggesting no benefit from the combination on this process. The effect of 6-TG and IFN-alpha on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was found to be sequence dependent. NK cell activity was markedly stimulated by IFN-alpha, whereas 6-TG alone seemed to have no direct effect. However, when the NK cells were pretreated with 100 IU/ml IFN-alpha followed by 10 microM 6-TG, the IFN-alpha-enhanced activity of NK cells was ablated. These results suggest that the immunosuppressive activity of 6-TG may be related to the acute inhibition of cytokine activation. Our results suggest that 6-TG and IFN-alpha have considerable interactions, which are sequence dependent. The optimal sequence for potential therapeutic application of these anticancer agents appears to be 6-TG pretreatment followed by IFN-alpha.","['Tan, Y Y', 'Epstein, L B', 'Armstrong, R D']","['Tan YY', 'Epstein LB', 'Armstrong RD']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/pathology']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4431-4.,['CA 27903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the fact that RU 38486 has been reported to promote considerable in vitro receptor activation to a DNA-binding form, this steroid may be relatively incapable of promoting this physiologically relevant conformational change in vivo. In the experiments reported here the potential ability of RU 38486 to promote in vivo activation has been compared with that of a potent agonist, triamcinolone acetonide. In vivo activation was evaluated by DEAE-cellulose chromatographic analyses of cytosolic extracts prepared from lysed cells which had previously been labeled with either 30 nM [3H]triamcinolone acetonide or [3H]RU 38486 and subsequently incubated at 37 degrees C. Using this anion-exchange procedure, in vivo activation of the agonist-receptor complexes was shown to occur in both a time- and temperature-dependent fashion in both cell lines. This in vivo activation was reflected by progressive decreases in the bound [3H]triamcinolone acetonide associated with the unactivated (high salt-eluting) peaks eluted from DEAE-cellulose, small yet detectable increases in the bound radioactivity eluted in the activated (low-salt eluting) peaks, and a significant increase in the ability of the cytoplasmic [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complexes to bind to DNA-cellulose. Additional experiments employing DEAE-cellulose chromatography demonstrated that after incubation at 37 degrees C for 1 h, at least some in vivo activation of cytosolic [3H]RU 38486-receptor complexes could be detected in CEM-C7 cells, although the antagonist was less effective than the agonist in facilitating this conformational change. In IM-9 lymphocytes essentially no in vivo activation could be detected using this same protocol. Nuclear translocation assays were also independently performed to evaluate in vivo receptor activation. Incubation of intact cells with 30 nM [3H]triamcinolone acetonide or [3H]RU 38486 for 1 h at 37 degrees C (but not at 0-4 degrees C) revealed that both steroids facilitated translocation in CEM-C7 as well as IM-9 cells, although again the antagonist was less effective than the agonist in this regard. Taken collectively these data indicate that the antagonist RU 38486 is capable of mediating detectable in vivo activation of CEM-C7 cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. These data suggest that complete in vivo stabilization of unactivated receptors by RU 38486 in this cell line may not be sufficient to explain the lack of any agonist activity associated with this synthetic antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Schmidt, T J']",['Schmidt TJ'],"['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Estrenes/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mifepristone', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4390-5.,['R01 AM 34490-03/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

As part of investigations of the biological activity of ASNase, we have developed techniques which measure the in vitro and in vivo cell killing ability of ASNase. To study the effect of ASNase on in vitro survival of primary lymphoblasts, bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were cultured with and without ASNase. After 5 days, viable cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion to calculate total cell kill due to ASNase. Propidium iodide exclusion, leukemia cell surface antigens, and flow cytometry were used to determine leukemia cell kill due to ASNase. Comparison of leukemia cell kill and total cell kill showed a direct linear relationship (n = 24, r = 0.7), preferential killing of leukemia cells by ASNase (slope = 0.66), and that use of leukemia cell surface markers yielded a more accurate measurement of leukemia cell killing. ASNase at concentrations from 0.0001 to 0.1 IU/ml had equal effects on extent of leukemia cell killing (P = 0.3 to 0.7), suggesting the absence of a dose response at the ASNase concentrations tested. As a measure of the in vivo response to ASNase treatment, the number of viable bone marrow leukemia cells in the patient prior to and 5 days after treatment with ASNase was measured as the product of (% of rhodamine 123 fluorescent [viable] cells) x (absolute leukemic infiltrate). The change which occurred in the viable leukemic infiltrate was the same for patients whether they received 25,000 or 2,500 IU/m2 of ASNase as a single drug. There was a linear correlation (n = 8, r = 0.9) between in vivo and in vitro leukemia cell killing by ASNase. Thus, the in vitro assay described here can be used to predict in vivo sensitivity to ASNase in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Asselin, B L', 'Ryan, D', 'Frantz, C N', 'Bernal, S D', 'Leavitt, P', 'Sallan, S E', 'Cohen, H J']","['Asselin BL', 'Ryan D', 'Frantz CN', 'Bernal SD', 'Leavitt P', 'Sallan SE', 'Cohen HJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 1;49(15):4363-8.,"['5PO1CA34183-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FDA000199-03/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'HL 07152/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cells exposed to relatively low concentrations of transferrin-indium exhibit markedly increased transferrin receptor expression but, as with transferrin-gallium, these cells incorporate an inappropriately low amount of iron, suggesting that there is a defect in the release of internalized iron from transferrin. In further studies, we utilize a monoclonal antibody against transferrin receptor that inhibits transferrin-mediated iron uptake.

A radioenzymatic assay based upon entrapment of tissue 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2FH4), and other reduced folates after cycling to this form, into a stable ternary complex with thymidylate synthase and [3H]-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate was used to estimate reduced folates. DNA synthesis was estimated from incorporation of [3H]-2'-deoxyuridine into DNA. The predominant reduced folate in cells from untreated animals was 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-CHOFH4; 3.59 pmol/10(6) cells). The four other reduced folates measured, tetrahydrofolate (FH4), CH2FH4, dihydrofolate (FH2), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3FH4), were present in nearly equal amounts yielding a total reduced folate level of 6.24 pmol/10(6) cells. When methotrexate was administered s.c. at doses of 1.5, 12, and 400 mg/kg, the level of FH2 increased dramatically and total tetrahydrofolates measured decreased extensively within 1 h. DNA synthesis was completely inhibited during the first 1-2 h after administration of each dose of methotrexate with onset of recovery after 4 and 20 h at 1.5 and 12 mg/kg and not at all after the highest dose. Both FH4 and CH2FH4 were extensively depleted at 12 and 400 mg/kg methotrexate but considerably less depletion of CH2FH4, and none of FH4, was observed at 1.5 mg/kg during a period when DNA synthesis was essentially abolished. The metabolically linked 5-CH3FH4 and 10-CHOFH4 pools were also extensively depleted following treatment with methotrexate. While FH2 levels expanded extensively after drug treatment, the total increase did not account for the extent of depletion of the combined tetrahydrofolate pools. The change in concentration with time of any one folate pool was apparently not sufficient to explain completely the duration of inhibition of DNA synthesis; however, sustained inhibition of DNA synthesis was generally associated with maintenance of an expanded FH2 pool and delay in repletion of the combined tetrahydrofolate pools. Discussion is presented with respect to the impact of these results on changing notions of the mode of action of classical antifolates.","['Priest, D G', 'Bunni, M', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Priest DG', 'Bunni M', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 1;49(15):4204-9.,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, development of resistance to the cytotoxic effects is a limiting factor. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of resistance, we have employed a host cell reactivation assay of DNA repair using a cis-DDP-damaged plasmid vector. The efficiency of DNA repair was assayed by measuring the activity of an enzyme coded for by the plasmid vector. The plasmid expression vector pRSVcat contains the bacterial gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in a configuration which permits expression in mammalian cells. The plasmid was transfected into repair-proficient and -deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, and CAT activity was subsequently measured in cell lysates. In the repair-deficient cells, one cis-DDP adduct per cat gene was sufficient to eliminate expression. An equivalent inhibition of CAT expression in the repair-proficient cells did not occur until about 8 times the amount of damage was introduced into the plasmid. These results implicate DNA intrastrand cross-links as the lesions responsible for the inhibition of CAT expression. This assay was used to investigate the potential role of DNA repair in mediating cis-DDP resistance in murine leukemia L1210 cells.

One carcinomatous cyst with consecutive involvement of the base of the tongue was preceded by a regular branchiogenic cyst on the opposite side. Removal of a recurrent branchiogenic cyst in another patient revealed unsuspected chronic myeloic leukaemia infiltrating adjacent lymph nodes. The hypotheses regarding the branchiogenic and lymphogenic pathogenesis of such carcinomatous cysts are discussed.

Thus, the breakpoints of chromosome 19 are different among the patients studied, proximal to the INSR gene locus in the AML case and distal in the two ALL cases. Consequently, the c-ets-1 gene and the INSR gene remain separated in the AML case, whereas they become close to each other in the two ALL cases.

CPIB was ineffective in altering ADR cytotoxicity in P388/S cells. However, in P388/ADR, CPIB enhanced ADR cytotoxicity at the lower concentrations of ADR and decreased the cytotoxicity upon increase in ADR concentrations.

The chromosomal joining on the 1p+ chromosome occurred at the T-cell receptor delta diversity (D delta 2) segment, and the reciprocal chromosomal joining on the 14q- chromosome occurred at the T-cell delta diversity segment D delta 1. The involvement of delta diversity segments at the translocation junctions suggests that the translocation occurred during an attempt at D delta 1-D delta 2 joining in a stem cell. The segment of chromosome 1 at band p32, adjacent to the chromosomal breakpoint, encodes a transcriptional unit designated TCL5 (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 5). The differential expression of the TCL5 RNA transcripts in this lymphohemopoietic stem cell line relative to several other T- and B-cell lines suggests that TCL5 gene expression is an integral event in the pathogenesis of the T-cell leukemia.

The binding was specific and was modulated upon heat shock. Furthermore, the binding protein was shown to be of the expected molecular weight by UV crosslinking.

The tumor is composed of lymphoblasts, which seem to arise from the thymic reticuloendothelial system and, at times, disseminate as an acute T cell lymphoma-leukemia of unknown etiology. If the tumor cells are transmitted intraperitoneally to rats, 14-16 days pregnant, a local invasive and generalized disease is established in the mother but not in the fetuses or their domain. However, if the neoplastic cells are injected into the fetal domain, they colonize the fetal tissues. The colonization by tumor cells is most impressive in the extravascular structure of the placental labyrinth but not in the placental syncytiotrophoblastic zone at the maternal-placental junction. This raises the question as to whether this zone may functionally mediate not only the well-known absolute intrauterine fetal defense against maternal metastatic neoplasia, but also the defense of the fetus against maternal immunologic rejection.","['Hass, G M', 'Galt, R M', 'Laing, G H', 'Coogan, P S', 'Maganini, R O', 'Friese, J A']","['Hass GM', 'Galt RM', 'Laing GH', 'Coogan PS', 'Maganini RO', 'Friese JA']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, Augustana Hospital, Chicago, Ill.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Magnesium,Magnesium,8219687,['I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)'],IM,"['Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Fetus/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*etiology/immunology/transmission', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology/transmission', 'Magnesium/physiology', 'Magnesium Deficiency/*complications/immunology', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Placenta/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Magnesium. 1989;8(1):45-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today no strict correlation between the prognosis of leukemia and the level of this ratio can be drawn. Similar behaviour of the pseudouridine/creatinine ratio is seen in other malignant diseases with exception of brain tumors.

In general, those anthraquinones bearing an amino function interact with DNA. 1,8-Dimethoxyanthraquinones are incapable of intercalating into DNA. 1- or 8-Monohydroxymono-methoxyanthraquinones, however, interact with DNA to some extent. No straightforward correlation is apparent between the DNA-affinity data of the compounds studied spectrophotometrically and their cytotoxic effects. Cytotoxic potencies of these compounds on cell growth inhibition during a 72-h period are inversely correlated to their potencies when inhibiting [3H]TdR incorporation into DNA during the initial 30 min of exposure. Surprisingly, some compounds that showed more cytotoxicity did not inhibit initial TdR incorporation (0-30 min), while some others that strongly inhibited TdR incorporation initially did not exhibit cytotoxicity in 72 h. The results suggest that the cytotoxicity produced by these compounds is time dependent and is not a direct result of initial inhibition of DNA replication.","['Koyama, M', 'Takahashi, K', 'Chou, T C', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Kapuscinski, J', 'Kelly, T R', 'Watanabe, K A']","['Koyama M', 'Takahashi K', 'Chou TC', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Kapuscinski J', 'Kelly TR', 'Watanabe KA']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Sloan-Kettering Division of Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)', 'N1ST8V8RR2 (chrysophanic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Emodin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Intercalating Agents', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00127a032 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1989 Jul;32(7):1594-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00127a032.,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27569/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Refractoriness was defined according to the response to induction therapy consisting of 6-thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin (TAD9) and the duration of the preceding remission. Patients were eligible for AMSA/VP 16-213 if they were primary non-responders against two TAD9 induction courses, had early relapses within the first six months, were nonresponders to one additional TAD9 course at later relapses or were at second or subsequent relapses.

VP 16-213 was applied on days 1 and 5 by a 1-h infusion of 100 mg/m2 followed by a 23 h infusion, the dosage of which was escalated in three steps from 110 mg/m2 over 200 mg/m2 to 230 mg/m2 in subsequent patients. Even at the highest dose of VP 16-213, toxicity was mild to moderate except for mucositis of grade III after two cycles and severe intrahepatic cholestasis in one case. Four of the 20 patients died within the first three weeks after the onset of treatment and were not evaluable for the assessment of antileukemic efficacy. From the remaining 16 patients five achieved partial remissions while no complete remission was obtained. Four of the five PR occurred in the eight patients with primary TAD9 resistance. These data indicate that AMSA/VP 16-213 reveals a moderate toxicity only, and that the combination may not be completely cross-resistant with TAD9.

As high as 73.6% of the patients were found to be positive for the anti-ATLA antibody, whereas in 38 Strongyloides-negative controls, the positive rate was only 18.4% A significant increase of OKT 4+ cells and a decrease of OKT 8+ cells were noted among the patients positive for anti-ATLA antibody. A considerable rise of spontaneous proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes and a depression of mitogen-induced proliferative responses were also found in the patients. The increase of background mitogenesis was considered to be due to the concurrent infection with the ATL virus, but the depressed responses to mitogenic stimuli seemed to have no relation with the presence of the viral infection. The possible contribution of strongyloidiasis as a cofactor predisposing to ATL viral infection or leading the virus carriers to ATL patients was discussed.","['Sato, Y', 'Shiroma, Y']","['Sato Y', 'Shiroma Y']","['Department of Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Strongyloidiasis/complications/*immunology']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(89)90173-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 Aug;52(2):214-24. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(89)90173-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, there were significantly elevated risks for direct exposure of the child to pesticides in the household (OR for exposure most days = 3.5; trend, P = 0.04) and for maternal exposure to household pesticides at the time of pregnancy (eight case mothers versus no controls for exposure most days; trend, P = 0.05). Paternal exposures to solvents (OR, 2.1; P = 0.003) and petroleum products (OR, 2.4; P = 0.002) were reported more commonly for cases than controls. Other occupational exposures reported significantly more often by case parents were paternal exposure to plastics or lead and maternal exposure to paints and pigments, metal dusts, and sawdust.

PGE1 caused a rapid and dose-dependent increase in the intracellular free calcium level ([Ca2+]i) associated with the elevation of cyclic AMP. The PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was decreased by the prior addition of ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethylether)tetraacetic acid to the medium by approximately 25% of the control. This result indicates that the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i is due to influx of Ca2+ from the external medium and to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Pretreatment of CMK cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a stimulus for protein kinase C, further enhanced the PGE1-induced increase in the cellular cyclic AMP level. Inversely, pretreatment of CMK cells with TPA (10 nM), prior to the addition of PGE1, inhibited the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin did not elevate [Ca2+]i or affect the PGE1-induced Ca2+ mobilization. The inhibitory action of TPA in the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was mimicked by other protein kinase C-activating agents, such as 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol and N-(6-phenylhexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, and was selectively restored by protein kinase C inhibitors, such as 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride and N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride. Thus, the inhibitory modulation of TPA on the PGE1-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i is mediated through protein kinase C activation. PGE1 had no inductional effect of megakaryocytic phenotypic changes in CMK cells. The biological role of PGE1, which increased [Ca2+]i and cyclic AMP levels in the CMK cells, remains to be determined.","['Adachi, M', 'Ryo, R', 'Yoshida, A', 'Teshigawara, K', 'Yamaguchi, N', 'Hoshijima, M', 'Takai, Y', 'Sato, T']","['Adachi M', 'Ryo R', 'Yoshida A', 'Teshigawara K', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Hoshijima M', 'Takai Y', 'Sato T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jul 15;49(14):3805-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell viability is assessed by flow cytometric measurement of cellular fluorescence after staining with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide in isotonic solution. The number of viable cells per ml of culture is determined by a timed count of viable cells and from knowledge of the flow cytometer sample flow rate. P388 murine or HL-60 human leukemia cells in culture were used as model systems. This method can quantify accurately viable cell concentrations in suspension culture from 100 cells/ml to 1 million cells/ml. The sensitivity of the method as a cytotoxicity assay increases if, following brief (1-4-h) exposure to drug, greater time is allowed for cell death and lysis to occur prior to flow cytometric counting of viable cells. If the viability assessment is deferred for at least 72 h following drug (daunorubicin, actinomycin D, vincristine) exposure, results were obtained approximating those obtained from the soft agar clonogenic assay or the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In studying the cytotoxic effects of vincristine, actinomycin D, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and daunorubicin on P388 or HL-60 cells sensitive and resistant to these agents, reasonable results were obtained by flow cytometric counting of viable cell number. We have been able to perform this flow cytometric viability assay with ease using bone marrow blast cells obtained from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The method is facile, relatively rapid, and since it is ideal for studying cells in suspension culture, its potential as a predictor of chemotherapeutic response in leukemia warrants further evaluation.","['Ross, D D', 'Joneckis, C C', 'Ordonez, J V', 'Sisk, A M', 'Wu, R K', 'Hamburger AW Nora, R E', 'Nora, R E']","['Ross DD', 'Joneckis CC', 'Ordonez JV', 'Sisk AM', 'Wu RK', 'Hamburger AW Nora RE', 'Nora RE']","['Program of Oncology, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'YL39R93PRE (diacetylfluorescein)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluoresceins', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Propidium', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1989/07/15 00:00,1989/07/15 00:01,['1989/07/15 00:00'],"['1989/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jul 15;49(14):3776-82.,['R0-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The complete remission (CR) rate for the secondary AMLs was 36% (24/66), with 24% (16/66) dying in the induction period and 39% (26/66) having resistant disease. The CR rate was 25% (5/20) for Group 1, 42% (15/36) for Group 2, and 40% (4/10) for Group 3. Even after allowance for the generally older age of the secondary AML patients, they still had a significantly poorer CR rate than the de novo AMLs (P = 0.0004). The lower CR rate was chiefly due to resistant disease. Despite this, overall survival was not significantly worse for the secondary AML patients (P = 0.15). For the 36% that achieved remission, remission duration appeared similar to that of de novo cases. Of 62 cases with adequate cytology, 38 (61%) had evidence of erythroid and/or megakaryocytic dysplasia with a CR rate of 32% (12/38). The CR rate of these multineage leukaemias was not significantly different from that of the 24 (39%) who showed granulocyte/monocyte precursor involvement only, 42% (10) of whom achieved CR.

Cellular acquisition of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype confers loss of sensitivity to a wide range of structurally dissimilar anti-neoplastic agents. This state can arise through increased expression of the mdrl (P-glycoprotein) gene. We have used the mdrl gene probe to investigate adriamycin resistant (HL60/AR) and vinblastine resistant (CEM/VLB100) human leukaemic cell lines. In addition, peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from 66 patients with MDS and AML have been screened for gene amplification and 40 cases for increased mRNA expression. P-glycoprotein gene amplification was observed only in the (CEM/VLB100) and not in the HL60/AR on any other leukaemic cell line. Gene amplification was not found in any patient's cells. Eighteen out of 40 patients showed an increase (2----20) of mdrl mRNA expression. These results are not only of significance in understanding the biology of human drug resistance but have practical importance in the design of anti-leukaemic therapy.","['Holmes, J', 'Jacobs, A', 'Carter, G', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A', 'Padua, R A']","['Holmes J', 'Jacobs A', 'Carter G', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Padua RA']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/*therapeutic use']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07649.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 May;72(1):40-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07649.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vivo BUDR method requires that a single tumour sample be taken 4-6 h after infusion and that bivariate flow cytometry (FCM) be employed to measure simultaneously the percentage of BUDR-labelled cells (which are identified with a green fluorescent anti-BUDR monoclonal antibody) and their mean DNA content (following propidium iodide staining). This technique rapidly furnishes the labelling index (LI) and the DNA synthesis time (TS), from which the tumour potential doubling time (Tpot) and production rate (fractional turnover rate, FTR) are calculated. The procedure took 6-9 h to complete and there was no immediate toxicity from BUDR administration. Successful LI and TS determinations were obtained in 89 (80%) and 80 (72%) of the 112 patients, respectively. Correlations were sought between kinetic parameters and a number of pathological and clinical ones. In 34 patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias who were uniformly treated for remission (CR) induction and maintenance, proliferative activity, as measured by Tpot and FTR, was greater in responsive than in non-responsive patients, and in those who experienced CR for over 8 months than in those who had a shorter CR. Proliferative activity was also greater in patients with advanced gastric cancers than in those with more limited disease. No correlations between kinetic and clinical and pathological parameters were found in gliomas. These data indicate the in vivo BUDR infusion coupled with FCM measurements can be performed in clinical settings to obtain kinetic data rapidly in quite large patient series. This will probably allow the inclusion of kinetic data in clinical trials aimed at evaluating the prognostic relevance of these data.","['Riccardi, A', 'Danova, M', 'Dionigi, P', 'Gaetani, P', 'Cebrelli, T', 'Butti, G', 'Mazzini, G', 'Wilson, G']","['Riccardi A', 'Danova M', 'Dionigi P', 'Gaetani P', 'Cebrelli T', 'Butti G', 'Mazzini G', 'Wilson G']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, Policlinico San Matteo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', '*Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*pathology']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1989.190 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1989 Jun;59(6):898-903. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1989.190.,,,PMC2246746,,['Br J Cancer 1993 Aug;68(2):451'],,,,,,,

The majority of leukaemias occurred in the first year of follow-up, but some excess risk continued beyond this time. The elevated risk of buccal and pharyngeal cancers may relate to heavy alcohol intake among this population, although risks remained high even when the cohort was restricted to patients without an admission for alcoholism.

A case-control study was performed to determine the relationship between the dose of radiotherapy received on a given anatomical site for the treatment of a first cancer, and the risk of SMN development at the same anatomical site. Another aim of the study was to analyse the effects of the association of radiotherapy with chemotherapy on the risk of SMN. The 32 cases of second malignant neoplasms were individually matched with one to nine patients of the cohort (a total of 162) who did not develop a SMN after a first cancer, matching on age, sex, type of first cancer and follow-up duration. The doses of radiotherapy delivered for the treatment of the first cancer were retrospectively estimated at the 26 anatomical sites of SMN. When the SMN was a leukaemia, the mean active bone-marrow dose was estimated as a weighted mean of the doses received by 20 bone sites. As compared to anatomical sites in children who had not received radiotherapy, the sites which had received 50 Gy or more had a relative risk of SMN of 5.8 (P less than 0.05). When taking into account the dose received at the site of the SMN, neither the number of fractions nor the type of radiations were related to the risk of SMN. Children who had received chemotherapy had a relative risk of SMN of 2.7 (95% CI: 1.2-6.4), adjusted for the dose of radiotherapy, as compared to those who had not. The relative risk of SMN did not vary with the dose nor the duration of the chemotherapy. Dactinomycin was found to increase the relative risk of second soft tissue and bone sarcomas. Cyclophosphamide was found to be less carcinogenic than the other alkylants. The relative risk of SMN was equal to 2.0 (n.s.) after radiotherapy of more than 25 Gy, to 4.4 (n.s.) after chemotherapy, and to 21.4 (P less than 0.01) after the combination of these two treatments modalities, as compared to patients treated by surgery alone.

Hybridization signals (10- to 200-fold intensified) and modified restriction patterns were observed with both cDNA probes in 4 of the 16 leukemia DNA preparations examined. These reflected the amplification of the corresponding AcChoEase and BtChoEase genes (ACHE and CHE) and alteration in their structure. Parallel analysis of 30 control samples revealed nonpolymorphic, much weaker hybridization signals for each of the probes. In view of previous reports on the effect of acetylcholine analogs and ChoEase inhibitors in the induction of megakaryocytopoiesis and production of platelets in the mouse, we further searched for such phenomena in nonleukemic patients with platelet production disorders. Amplifications of both ACHE and CHE genes were found in 2 of the 4 patients so far examined. Pronounced coamplification of these two related but distinct genes in correlation with pathological production of blood cells suggests a functional role for members of the ChoEase family in megakaryocytopoiesis and raises the question whether the coamplification of these genes could be causally involved in the etiology of hemocytopoietic disorders.","['Lapidot-Lifson, Y', 'Prody, C A', 'Ginzberg, D', 'Meytes, D', 'Zakut, H', 'Soreq, H']","['Lapidot-Lifson Y', 'Prody CA', 'Ginzberg D', 'Meytes D', 'Zakut H', 'Soreq H']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.8 (Butyrylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.8 (Cholinesterases)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*blood/genetics', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/blood/*enzymology/genetics', 'Butyrylcholinesterase/*blood/genetics', 'Cholinesterases/*blood', 'DNA/blood/genetics', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*enzymology/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.12.4715 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Jun;86(12):4715-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.12.4715.,,,PMC287342,,,,,,,,,

In this homologous part of the genes, GPB lacks one exon due to a point mutation at the 5' splicing site of the third intron, which inactivates the 5' cleavage event of splicing and leads to ligation of the second to the fourth exon. Following these very homologous sequences, the genomic sequences for GPA and GPB diverge significantly and no homology can be detected in their 3' end sequences. The transition site from homologous to nonhomologous sequences can be localized within Alu repeat sequences. The analysis of the Alu sequences and their flanking direct repeat sequences suggest that an ancestral genomic structure has been maintained in the GPA gene, whereas the GPB gene has arisen from the acquisition of 3' sequences different from those of the GPA gene by homologous recombination at the Alu repeats during or after gene duplication.","['Kudo, S', 'Fukuda, M']","['Kudo S', 'Fukuda M']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes', 'Glycophorins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.12.4619 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Jun;86(12):4619-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.12.4619.,['R01 CA33000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC287322,,,,"['GENBANK/M24123', 'GENBANK/M24124', 'GENBANK/M24125', 'GENBANK/M24126', 'GENBANK/M24127', 'GENBANK/M24128', 'GENBANK/M24130', 'GENBANK/M24131', 'GENBANK/M24132', 'GENBANK/M24133', 'GENBANK/M24134', 'GENBANK/M24135', 'GENBANK/M24136', 'GENBANK/M24137']",,,,,

We approached this problem by studying the molecular features of the bcr/abl abnormality in rare CML patients with very long, atypical chronic phase. The three patients studied, whose chronic phase duration is 17, 19, and 21 years, respectively, have typical genomic bcr rearrangements, and two of them show, hybridizing Northern blots to c-abl, the 8.5 kb mRNA, as that typically present in CML.

During this translocation, the c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 is transferred to the Ph1 chromosome and linked to a breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which is part of a large bcr gene. This phenomenon results in the formation of a bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein. The fusion protein has tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. The breakpoint near the c-abl locus on chromosome 9 can occur within a large area. In contrast, the breakpoints on chromosome 22 cluster within the bcr region of 5.8 kb. A chronic phase lasts for an average of 2 to 3 years; and, subsequently, most patients enter blast crisis. In the present study, we examined 15 Ph1-positive CML patients (eight in chronic phase, one in accelerated phase, and six in blast crises) as to whether the identifiable difference in the locations of the bcr breakpoints exist between CML patients in chronic phase and those in blast crisis. In seven of eight CML patients in chronic phase, in one in accelerated phase, and in four out of six CML patients in blast crisis, the bcr breakpoints clustered in the 3' portion of the bcr. Thus, we could not find out the correlation between the locations of the bcr breakpoints and the clinical stage of the CML patients. This might imply that blastic transformation in Ph1-positive CML was caused by other mechanisms than the transition of the bcr breakpoints.","['Ogawa, H', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Soma, T', 'Masaoka, T', 'Kishimoto, S']","['Ogawa H', 'Sugiyama H', 'Soma T', 'Masaoka T', 'Kishimoto S']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):492-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patterns of immunophenotypic course were observed when following the patients through at least one, sometimes two (six patients), or three relapses (one patient). Induction chemotherapy induced predominantly TdT+ leukemias with a minor monoblastic component to become TdT-negative, purely monoblastic without clinical response or change in karyotype in five patients (group 1). In group 2, relapse was associated with the disappearance (four patients) or the appearance of TdT+/nonlymphoid antigen+ features (four patients). In two instances, new nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities, in one case, evolution of an initial abnormal cytogenetic clone, were found at relapse. Six patients (group 3) presented and relapsed with identical TdT+ myeloblastic, promyeloblastic, monoblastic immunophenotype and karyotype. In general, FAB classification did not reflect expression of TdT in nonlymphocytic leukemias or the presence of nonlymphoid blast features in lymphocytic leukemias. Lymphoid-specific antigens in addition to TdT were not detected in any of the cases at the time of nonlymphoid antigen expression. In 11 of the 19 patients, simultaneous expression of TdT and myeloid or monocytic antigens could be demonstrated at the single cell level using double-fluorescence staining. These follow-up data are best consistent with a drug-induced maturation drive of a TdT+/monocytic (majority of cases) or TdT+/myelocytic leukemic stem cell with its differentiation commitment being influenced by chemotherapy or by other as yet undefined conditions predisposing to proliferation of the leukemic cell at relapse.","['Paietta, E', 'Gucalp, R', 'Papenhausen, P', 'Dutcher, J P', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Paietta E', 'Gucalp R', 'Papenhausen P', 'Dutcher JP', 'Wiernik PH']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/analysis/*pathology', '*DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/analysis/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*classification/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monitoring, Immunologic', 'Phenotype', 'Recurrence']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jul;3(7):485-91.,['P30CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-three of 52 offspring born to survivors of heritable retinoblastoma developed retinoblastoma; the heritable form of retinoblastoma is known to be transmitted to offspring as an autosomal dominant. None of the 94 offspring born to the 54 survivors of unilateral retinoblastoma with no family history of the disease have developed the disease. This implies that it is unlikely that more than 9% of survivors of unilateral retinoblastoma with no family history have the germ-cell mutation; consequently it is unlikely that more than 4% of their offspring will be affected. Among the 1,199 offspring born to 629 survivors of other childhood malignant disease, who produced children, one acute monocytic leukaemia and one acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were observed. This is more than expected on the basis of the general population (one-tailed p = 0.04). However, the types of cancer observed in these 2 offspring and their parents conform to a previously described familial aggregation of cancers. Only a small number of children were born to survivors who received therapy that was potentially germ-cell mutagenic, and thus it is not possible to make any accurate estimation of their risk of malignant disease.","['Hawkins, M M', 'Draper, G J', 'Smith, R A']","['Hawkins MM', 'Draper GJ', 'Smith RA']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics/mortality', 'Probability', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910430604 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Jun 15;43(6):975-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910430604.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased incorporation was also observed in superoxide dismutase (SOD)-treated cells. DMSO also determined an early and significant drop in AC activity and a late fall in catalase activity, whereas there was no significant variation in GP activity in parallel with the decreased cell multiplication that accompanied cell differentiation.

We now revise our previous results on the basis of additional findings and estimate the age- and sex-specific cumulative rate for HTLV-I carriers, the adoption of which is recommended by current cancer epidemiology as a new age-standardized incidence rate. An unequivocal age-dependent increase in seroprevalence was observed for both sexes with a characteristic predominance in females. The age-dependent seroconversion in females may be partly explained by additional infection from infected husbands to their wives but the reason for men remains obscure. The mean annual number of incident cases of ATLL was 11.4, giving 3.9 ATLL patients annually per 10(5) inhabitants, 6.1 per 10(5) inhabitants aged over 30, and 85.0 per 10(5) seropositives aged over 30. Crude annual incidence rate of ATLL among 10(5) male seropositives aged over 30 was 145.3 and that for females was 55.2 and 95% confidence intervals of ATLL incidence rates were 34.8 to 255.7 for males and 6.4 to 104.1 for females, respectively. Although the sex ratio of 80 ATLL patients was 1.35, males are more prone to the disease (46 male patients among 4,522 male seropositives aged over 30 vs 34 female patients among 8,801 female seropositives aged over 30; p less than 0.001) for unknown reason(s). Morbidity in male seropositives aged over 30 is 2.6 times as high as that of females. Decennial incidence rates in males in their fifties and sixties were significantly higher than those in females. The remarkable male preponderance in oncogenicity of HTLV-I may be due to the fact that men are more prone to the disease and the number of female carriers in the denominator used to calculate the incidence rate is larger than that of males.

This culture system provides an easy method for obtaining highly purified NK cells, by sequential incubation of monocyte-depleted cells with SEB and then with interleukin-2 (IL-2). After culture for 4 to 5 days in the presence of SEB, 98 to 100% of the cells expressed the CD16 (Leu11) and HNK-1 (Leu19) antigens. This purification occurred through the death of lymphocytes lacking NK cell markers and marked proliferation of NK cells themselves, which leads to an enrichment of the NK cell population. Activation of NK cells was detected by the appearance of the gamma interferon receptor and IL-2 receptor antigens. This homogeneous population showed the morphology of large granular lymphocytes, were potent effectors of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against K562 and Daudi tumor cell lines, and were able to kill gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. IL-2 was necessary to maintain the activation and proliferation after SEB stimulation for 4 days. Moreover, the maximum frequency of binding to K562 cells (60.6%) was similar to that recently found (58 +/- 3%) (P. Garcia-Penarrubia, F. T. Koster, and A. D. Bankhurst, J. Immunol.

We have utilized established hematopoietic cell lines to establish the different mechanism by which growth autonomy is acquired. The analysis of thirteen spontaneous factor-independent mutants revealed that the majority (12/13) secreted a factor that stimulated growth of the parental cell line. Thus, autocrine stimulation may be a important mechanism by which normal growth control is disrupted. This is supported by the observation of Young and Griffin (1987) that some cells isolated from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) autogenously produce growth factor. In the majority of Dind mutants more closely examined, growth factor gene activation was due to the juxtapostion of a retrotransposon. Although the exact nature of the involvement of human retroviruses in inducing leukemia has not been elucidated, one could envisage that altered growth factor regulation due to integration of the virus may play an important role. The existence of a second class of Dind mutants that have obtained factor-independence by a mechanism not involving factor production concurs with the acquisition of factor-independent growth in hematopoietic cells after introduction of some oncogenes. Several models have been proposed to explain how oncogenes may ""short circuit"" and thus activate the normal signal transduction pathway by mimicking the active receptor, transducer, or effector (Weinberg, 1985). To investigate more closely the role of autocrine stimulation in the induction of growth autonomy and tumorigenicity, retroviral vectors expressing either GM-CSF or IL3 were introduced into factor-dependent hematopoitic cell lines. Non-linear clonability of infected cell lines in the absence of exogenous growth factor and inhibition of proliferation by antiserum supported a model of autocrine stimulation. However, a secondary event, correlated with amount of factor released, often occurred that abrogated the requirement for secreted CSF. Growth of cells in which this alteration had occured was cell-density independent and could not be blocked by antibody. It has been postulated that autogenous factor may react with its receptor intracellularly (Lang et al., 1985). The results presented here cannot exclude that the secondary events may allow the internal interaction of receptor and factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Stocking, C', 'Kawai, M', 'Laker, C', 'Loliger, C', 'Kluge, N', 'Klingler, K', 'Ostertag, W']","['Stocking C', 'Kawai M', 'Laker C', 'Loliger C', 'Kluge N', 'Klingler K', 'Ostertag W']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,['0 (Growth Substances)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Growth Substances/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic System/drug effects/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-74623-9_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1989;149:117-26. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74623-9_11.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complexes of the intercalating agent, acridine orange, with double-stranded DNA in situ, emit green fluorescence upon excitation with blue laser light. The histograms were evaluated by first determining the standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity relative to the mean channel of fluorescence, i.e., the coefficient of variation, and then dividing the coefficient of variation of a patient's sample by that of a control sample (rCV). The mean rCV of cell populations of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (31 patients) differed significantly from that of nonlymphoblastic leukemia (21 patients). When cells were treated with a solution of citric acid and magnesium sulfate prior to their staining with acridine orange, the mean rCV of cell populations of acute lymphoblastic leukemia increased while that of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia decreased compared to their respective pretreatment values. The mean difference of rCVs between untreated and treated cells (rCVD) within each disease category was statistically significant.

Cells used were L1210 leukemia, normal mouse bone marrow, and peripheral blood cells obtained from a patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). Endpoints used were determination of single strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand and DNA-protein cross-links. After treatment of mice with CY (4 mg/mouse), low levels of single strand breaks were observed in both L1210 leukemia and CDF1 normal bone marrow. When a patient with CLL was treated with CY (750 mg/m2), no evidence of single strand breaks could be demonstrated. Maximum levels of DNA-DNA interstrand cross-links were observed in mice 2 h after injection of CY for the L1210 leukemia cells [175 +/- 25 rad-equivalents (req)] and at 4 h for the CDF1 normal bone marrow cells (47 +/- 9 req). In human CLL, maximum levels were observed 12 h after injection of CY. Peak levels of DNA-DNA interstrand cross-links were approximately 4-fold lower in CDF1 normal bone marrow cells than in L1210 leukemia.

In order to obtain equitoxicity between L1210 leukemia and CDF1 normal bone marrow cells, about 18-fold higher doses of CY had to be given than in the case of the normal bone marrow cells.

Molecular analysis showed a germ line configuration in both T-cell receptor beta-chain genes and T-cell receptor tau-chain genes. A clonal anomaly of chromosome (trisomy 8) was demonstrated in peripheral blood cells. LGL after acute transformation of the disease displayed large blastic morphology with prominent nucleoli, intense basophilic cytoplasm, and numerous granules. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a mosaic of trisomy 8 and trisomy 8 with an additional marker chromosome. Thus, transformation of chronic LGL leukemia into an acute or aggressive form in this patient was associated with morphologic and karyotypic changes of the leukemic cells. Patients with a stable form of chronic LGL leukemia should be examined carefully for the possible acute crisis associated with a clonal evolution.","['Ohno, Y', 'Amakawa, R', 'Fukuhara, S', 'Huang, C R', 'Kamesaki, H', 'Amano, H', 'Imanaka, T', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Arita, Y', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Ohno Y', 'Amakawa R', 'Fukuhara S', 'Huang CR', 'Kamesaki H', 'Amano H', 'Imanaka T', 'Takahashi Y', 'Arita Y', 'Uchiyama T', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Tenri Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Genetic Markers/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mosaicism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Trisomy']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19890701)64:1<63::aid-cncr2820640111>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Jul 1;64(1):63-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890701)64:1<63::aid-cncr2820640111>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,,,,,,,,,

By means of a highly sensitive assay, combination of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), we analyzed 38 blood samples obtained from 31 patients with Ph'-positive CML and two patients with Ph'-negative bcr rearranged CML. Among the 21 samples obtained in chronic phase, eight patients had the L-6 mRNA, 11 had the K-28 mRNA, and two had both the L-6 and K-28 mRNAs. Among the nine samples obtained in blast crisis, four contained the L-6 mRNA, two contained the K-28 mRNA, and three contained both the K-28 and L-6 mRNAs. This finding supports the concept of alternative splicing of bcr/abl mRNAs transcribed in Ph'-positive CML. However, it appears to be a rare event. Of the eight samples obtained from eight patients who had achieved complete cytogenetic remission and negativity for bcr region rearrangement for 6 months to 3 years after recombinant alpha interferon (r alpha-IFN) therapy, all of them showed evidence of minimal residual Ph'-positive clones as detected by the RT/PCR assay. This finding suggests that interferon therapy suppresses the proliferation of the Ph'-positive clones, but it does not completely eradicate the Ph'-positive stem cells.","['Lee, M S', 'LeMaistre, A', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Stass, S A']","['Lee MS', 'LeMaistre A', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Trujillo JM', 'Stass SA']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['*DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Taq Polymerase', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75468-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jun;73(8):2165-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spleen cells express two nucleoside transport systems: (1) the non-concentrative, symmetrical, Na+-independent transporter with broad substrate specificity, which has been found in all mammalian cells and is sensitive to inhibition by dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine; and (2) a Na+-dependent nucleoside transport, which is specific for uridine and purine nucleosides and resistant to inhibition by dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine. The kinetic properties of the two transporters were determined by measuring uridine influx in ATP-depleted cells and dipyridamole-treated cells, respectively. The Michaelis-Menten constants for Na+-independent and -dependent transport were about 40 and 200 microM, respectively, but the first-order rate constants were about the same for both transport systems. Nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitivity of the facilitated nucleoside transporter correlated with the presence of about 10,000 high-affinity (Kd = 0.6 nM) nitrobenzylthioinosine-binding sites per cell. The turnover number of the nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive nucleoside transporter was comparable to that of mouse P388 leukemia cells. The activation energy of this transporter was 20 kcal/mol. Entry of uridine via either of the transport routes was rapidly followed by its phosphorylation and conversion to UTP. The Michaelis-Menten constant for the in situ phosphorylation of uridine was about 50 microM and the first-order rate constants for phosphorylation and transport were about the same. The spleen cells also efficiently salvaged adenosine, adenine, and hypoxanthine, but not thymidine.","['Plagemann, P G', 'Woffendin, C']","['Plagemann PG', 'Woffendin C']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Sodium/*physiology', 'Spleen/*metabolism', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Uridine/*metabolism']",1989/06/06 00:00,1989/06/06 00:01,['1989/06/06 00:00'],"['1989/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(89)90043-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(89)90043-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1989 Jun 6;981(2):315-25. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(89)90043-6.,"['CA 09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 24468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

As a recent trend of progress in lymphoma study, the introduction of molecular diagnosis by means of gene rearrangement analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptor has contributed diagnostically to a definitive determination of T and B cell lineage and cellular monoclonality in malignant lymphoma. On the other hand, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of malignant lymphoma in recent years. After all, in HD even far advanced cases have been expected to be curable by the combination chemotherapy, for example, MOPP regimen in USA at the present time. Furthermore, in NHL even advanced cases with such aggressive lymphoma as diffuse large cell lymphoma of B cell type have also been able to survive for more than 10 years and may be curable with the frequency of more than 30% in several institutions. Nowadays, the treatment for malignant lymphoma has focussed on multidisciplinary cure-oriented therapy including chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a collaboration of surgical procedure and immunotherapeutic maneuvers. The recent chemotherapy regimen has been called ""third generation"" ones characterized by alternating non-cross resistant combination and frequent administration of intense drug dose. Furthermore, various biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, several BRMs including IFNs, IL-2 and TNF, and recombinant G-CSF and GM-CSF have been applied in lymphoma treatment to improve the efficacy of combination chemotherapy in new designs of clinical trials.","['Shirakawa, S', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Kita, K', 'Ohno, T', 'Miwa, H']","['Shirakawa S', 'Kobayashi T', 'Kita K', 'Ohno T', 'Miwa H']","['2nd Dept. of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mie University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The success rate of antibiotic therapy for septicemia was 76% if the patients were not under antibiotic therapy when septicemia developed. But recovery from septicemia was only 25% if the patients were undergoing antibiotic therapy when septicemia developed. Some 90% of neutropenic patients under 500/microliters, who were not under antibiotic therapy when septicemia developed, recovered from septicemia if the neutrophil count increased in the following 5 days. Change in the neutrophil count was an important factor determining the success or failure of antibiotic therapy for septicemia. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Shortening of the period of neutropenia or preventing its occurrence should reduce the incidence and the severity of infection. 2) Infection of herpes zoster in cancer patients. Thirty-four cancer patients were associated with herpes zoster. Eleven of them were patients with malignant lymphoma and ten of them were patients of breast cancer. Most patients were heavily pretreated by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy before the development of herpes zoster. Marked lymphocytopenia was observed at the onset of herpes zoster. Absolute lymphocyte count was under 1000/microliters in 71% of these patients. Development of herpes zoster in cancer patients was considered to be due to the depression of cell-mediated immunity which was the result of repeated and continued anticancer therapy. Acyclovir was found to be effective to treat herpes zoster in these patients. 3) Trend of organisms detected in cancer hospital. The frequency of organisms isolated from clinical materials in the National Cancer Center Hospital was compared during the period from 1978 to 1982 and the period from 1983 to 1987.

These results suggest that piperacillin may have a role as a protective agent against the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin.","['Hayashi, T', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Kumano, K', 'Kitayama, R', 'Muratani, T', 'Yasuda, T', 'Saikawa, I', 'Katahira, J', 'Kumada, T', 'Shimizu, K']","['Hayashi T', 'Watanabe Y', 'Kumano K', 'Kitayama R', 'Muratani T', 'Yasuda T', 'Saikawa I', 'Katahira J', 'Kumada T', 'Shimizu K']","['Research Laboratory, Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['2N81MY12TE (Fosfomycin)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Fosfomycin/therapeutic use', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Male', 'Piperacillin/*therapeutic use', 'Platinum/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.33.4.513 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1989 Apr;33(4):513-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.33.4.513.,,,PMC172470,,,,,,,,,

Fragile-site carrier status was not determined in case or control probands. No significant excess of cancer in case relatives, compared with either control relatives or to general (SEER) population expectancies, was found. Furthermore, there was neither evidence of cancer at younger ages, when cases were compared with control relatives, nor an excess of cancer at multiple sites. Male relatives of cases did, however, show a small excess of cancer, especially in older age groups. There was a slight, but not statistically significant, excess of lung cancer in case relatives, with this deviation occurring almost exclusively in relatives of probands having rearrangements at 11q23 and having lymphoid leukemia. It is possible that heritable tendency to chromosomal rearrangement--and thus to cancer--is expressed in such a small proportion of family members that cancer excess in these families could not be detected with the numbers of relatives analyzed in this study, although there was no significant evidence for a hereditary predisposition to cancer in the families of probands with leukemia and with chromosomal rearrangements at the same apparent chromosomal location as rare fragile sites.","['Mules, E H', 'Testa, J R', 'Thomas, G H', 'Abbey, H', 'Cohen, B H']","['Mules EH', 'Testa JR', 'Thomas GH', 'Abbey H', 'Cohen BH']","['Genetics Laboratory, Kennedy Institute, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1989 Jun;44(6):811-9.,"['917/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01CA36468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1715657,,,,,,,,,

The area was subdivided into three zones (A, B, and R) having decreasing mean levels of TCDD soil contamination. This study examines the mortality between 1976 and 1986 among the subjects, aged 20-74 years, who were resident in the area since the accident (n = 556 in zone A, n = 3,920 in zone B, n = 26,227 in zone R). Subjects' exposure was classified by residence. A referent cohort of 167,391 subjects who lived in the immediate surroundings was concurrently examined. Vital status ascertainment was successful for over 99% of the subjects. Increased mortality from cardiovascular causes was found; incident-related stressors were considered more relevant to increased mortality than was TCDD exposure. Mortality from several cancers was elevated. The increases in biliary cancer (females), brain cancer, and lymphatic and hemopoietic neoplasms (particularly leukemia in males) did not appear to result from chance, confounding, or information/comparison bias. However, no definite patterns related to exposure classification were apparent. Merely suggestive increases in soft tissue tumors and melanoma were also noted. Liver and breast cancer mortality tended to be below expectations. Interpretation is hampered by the short observation period, small number of deaths from certain causes, and poor exposure definition.

Several deletion mutants have been isolated in this laboratory from Friend erythroleukemia cells persistently infected with vaccinia virus strain IHD-W, designated SQAvac. Two of the mutants, which remain stable after serial passage in L cells, have been characterized. The deletion which range between 20 to 22 kb, has been localized at the left terminus comprising HindIII fragments C and N. In addition, HindIII B fragment lost the sequences that hybridize to pAG5, a plasmid containing the 3.5 kb terminal sequences and acquired different restriction sites. Phenotypic characterization of these mutants revealed that they were not replication defective since they grew in all cell lines tested and produced plaques of the same size as the wild-type. However, they were less effective in suppressing host protein synthesis. The LD50 for the mutants titered in NIH Swiss female mice was greater than 10(9) PFU as compared to 10(6) PFU for the wild-type, indicating reduced virulence in vivo.

Only 53% of black children attended hospital on the appointed day compared with 90% of white children. Less than 50% of black parents understood the nature of their child's illness. Both black and white families had unused medication at home. White parents more frequently reported toxic effects related to chemotherapy and more white children than black children exhibited lymphopenia during maintenance therapy. Assessment of drug compliance should be included as an independent variable when evaluating factors affecting response to chemotherapy in communities of diverse ethnic, socio-economic and cultural backgrounds.","['MacDougall, L G', 'Wilson, T D', 'Cohn, R', 'Shuenyane, E N', 'McElligott, S E']","['MacDougall LG', 'Wilson TD', 'Cohn R', 'Shuenyane EN', 'McElligott SE']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of the Witwatersrand, RSA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['African Americans', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Blacks', 'Child', 'Complementary Therapies', 'Educational Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Parents', '*Patient Compliance', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'South Africa', 'Whites']",1989/05/20 00:00,1989/05/20 00:01,['1989/05/20 00:00'],"['1989/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1989 May 20;75(10):481-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of risk coefficients for site-specific cancer mortality based on the DS86 and T65DR shielded kerma and organ doses.",502-24,"As a result of the reassessment of the A-bomb dosimetry, new (DS86) doses were calculated in 1986. In this paper, site-specific estimates of cancer mortality in the years 1950-1985, based on these new doses, are compared with those using the T65DR doses. The subjects of the study are 75,991 members of the Life Span Study sample for whom DS86 doses have been calculated. This reevaluation of the exposures does not change the list of radiation-related cancers. Most differences in dose response between Hiroshima and Nagasaki are no longer significant with the DS86 doses. The dose-response curve is closer to linear with the DS86 than the T65DR doses even for leukemia in the entire dose range, though, statistically, many other models cannot be excluded. However, in the low-dose range, the risk of leukemia remains nonlinear. Assuming a linear model at an RBE of 1, and using organ-absorbed doses, the risk coefficients derived from the two dosimetries are very similar, whereas those based on shielded kerma are about 40% higher with the new dosimetry. If RBE values larger than 1 are assumed, the disparity between the two dosimetries increases because the neutron dose is much greater in the T65DR. At an RBE of 10, for the five specific cancers, i.e., female breast, colon, leukemia, lung, and stomach, the increase in excess number of deaths per 10(4) PYSv under the DS86 varies from 12% (colon) to 133% (female breast). The magnitude of the effects of such modifiers of radiation-induced cancer as age at time of bomb and sex do not differ between the two dose systems.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Kato, H', 'Schull, W J', 'Preston, D L', 'Fujita, S', 'Pierce, D A']","['Shimizu Y', 'Kato H', 'Schull WJ', 'Preston DL', 'Fujita S', 'Pierce DA']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', 'Neutrons', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Risk']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1989 Jun;118(3):502-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were carried out to identify unique aspects of MACE localization by murine leukemia L1210 cells in vitro. Octanol/water partitioning studies were used to quantitate the hydrophobicity of MACE and two analogs, chlorin e6 and mesochlorin. Sites of cellular localization of these dyes were probed by fluorescence studies, and by examining loci of photodamage. These studies indicate that MACE, a hydrophilic dye, partitions to cytoplasmic loci. Data obtained with chlorin e6, a more hydrophobic dye, are consistent with binding at both membrane and cytoplasmic sites. A substantially more hydrophobic product, meso-chlorin, binds primarily to the cell membrane. While the tumor-localizing porphyrin product HPD binds to plasma LDL less than HDL, MACE and CE are predominantly bound to plasma protein and HDL. Patterns of distribution and localization of MACE differ substantially from those observed with HPD and other hydrophobic sensitizers.

Based on the consensus nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA, the mouse BMMC proteoglycan peptide core is 16.7 kDa and contains a 21-amino acid glycosaminoglycan attachment region consisting of alternating serine and glycine residues. When the predicted amino acid sequence of the mouse BMMC proteoglycan peptide core was compared with the predicted amino acid sequences of the homologous molecules expressed in RBL-1 cells and in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, the mouse-derived sequence was more closely homologous to the rat sequence than the human sequence except for the length of the serine-glycine repeat region.

Nucleotide sequences within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the mouse, rat, and human proteoglycan cDNA were conserved.

Although there was little binding of the reversibly associating ligand [3H]dexamethasone in r- mutants, labeling with the covalent affinity ligand [3H] dexamethasone 21-mesylate revealed significant amounts of a 92 kilodalton human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) protein. Immunoblots of hGR protein in r- and normal cells showed that r- mutants expressed approximately half the amount of immunoreactive hGR protein seen in dexs cells. Comparison of the genomic organization of the hGR genes in normal and mutant cells revealed no discernable differences in the structure, or dosage, indicating that the r- phenotype was not the result of gross deletion or rearrangement of the hGR genes. In addition, r- cells expressed the same 7 kilobase mRNA as normal cells. More importantly, the amount of hGR mRNA expressed in r- cells was never significantly less, and in some cases was greater than, that seen in normal cells, indicating that the decrease in immunoreactive hGR protein seen in r- cells is not the result of loss of hGR mRNA expression. Taken together with the known mutation rate of the hGR gene(s) in these cells, these results suggest that the hGR genes in dexs CEM-C7 cells are allelic and that dexs cells express both a normal hGR protein and one with an altered steroid binding site. Furthermore, they suggest that the r- phenotype is acquired as the result of mutation within the coding region of the originally functional allele, leading to loss of ligand binding and expression of immunoreactive product.","['Harmon, J M', 'Elsasser, M S', 'Eisen, L P', 'Urda, L A', 'Ashraf, J', 'Thompson, E B']","['Harmon JM', 'Elsasser MS', 'Eisen LP', 'Urda LA', 'Ashraf J', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Pharmacology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Ligands', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend-3-4-734 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1989 Apr;3(4):734-43. doi: 10.1210/mend-3-4-734.,"['CA-32226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

It has a weakly oncogenic effect in immature murine hematopoietic cells and does not transform NIH 3T3 cells. We have found that P210 has a strikingly different effect in Rat-1 cells, another line of established rodent fibroblasts. Stable expression of P210 in Rat-1 cells caused a distinct morphological change and conferred both tumorigenicity and capacity for anchorage-independent growth. The introduction of v-myc into Rat-1 cells expressing P210 led to complete morphological transformation and enhanced tumorigenicity. No such interaction took place in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, Rat-1 cells can be used to detect cooperation between BCR-ABL and other oncogenes and may prove useful for the identification of secondary oncogenic events in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Lugo, T G', 'Witte, O N']","['Lugo TG', 'Witte ON']","['Department of Microbiology, University of California, Los Angeles 90024-1570.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Rats']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.9.3.1263-1270.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Mar;9(3):1263-70. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.3.1263-1270.1989.,['5T32GM08243-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC362717,,,,,,,,,

Interferon was administered daily subcutaneously for 3 months and then every second or third day. Induction of neopterin excretion was chosen as the marker for definition of biological response. The smallest IFN dose causing maximum in vivo induction of biosynthesis of the GTP-degradation product neopterin was deemed ""biologically optimal."" Both dose regimens were effective, but the low-dose regimen was almost free of toxicity. Thus, in HCL patients alpha-IFN related toxicity can be separated from its antineoplastic activity. Low doses of alpha-IFN should be considered for treatment of HCL patients who develop toxic side effects and for primary treatment of HCL patients with severe cytopenia.","['Gastl, G', 'Werter, M', 'De Pauw, B', 'Nerl, C', 'Aulitzky, W', 'von Luttichau, I', 'Tilg, H', 'Thaler, J', 'Lang, A', 'Abbrederis, K']","['Gastl G', 'Werter M', 'De Pauw B', 'Nerl C', 'Aulitzky W', 'von Luttichau I', 'Tilg H', 'Thaler J', 'Lang A', 'Abbrederis K', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Biopterin/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neopterin', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Jun;3(6):453-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy percent of Tdt-negative ANLL and 30% of Tdt-positive ANLL were positive; 100% of CMMOL and 100% of CML in myeloblastic crisis or accelerated phase were positive. In contrast, M195 was positive on only 8% of 51 lymphoblastic leukemias and 1% of 70 other nonmyeloid samples. M195 binding did not correlate well with FAB classification of ANLL. The pattern of reactivity of M195 was similar but not identical to that of MY9 (CD33) on the same cases (83% concordance). Cross-blocking of M195 binding by MY9 and L4F3 (CD33) was demonstrated. M195 may bind to a different epitope on the same protein antigen. The presence of both MY9 and M195 positivity on a leukemia sample had a 98% specificity of diagnosing ANLL, which was greater than MY9 alone (88%) or M195 alone (92%). Assays of granulocytic-monocytic and erythroid colony-forming units showed M195 to be present on these hematopoietic progenitors.

TCR beta-chain and TCR gamma-chain rearrangement occurred in six and five patients respectively, while TCR delta-chain rearrangement was identified in 15 patients. Our data indicate that ALL in infancy may present with heterogeneous immunophenotypic and genotypic features.

Recombinant viral genomes were built which carried a selectable marker and an extra copy of the LTR-LTR junction from a cloned circular provirus. The junction sequence in each case was positioned such that its use during integration would lead to an easily detected, aberrantly integrated proviral DNA. Analysis of DNA from cells infected with the virus constructs showed that the introduced junction sequence is used at least 1,000-fold less efficiently than the natural sequences at the ends of the genome. This suggests that a linear or more exotic DNA intermediate is most likely the true precursor for the integration reaction.","['Lobel, L I', 'Murphy, J E', 'Goff, S P']","['Lobel LI', 'Murphy JE', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'Proviruses/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.6.2629-2637.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Jun;63(6):2629-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.6.2629-2637.1989.,['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC250744,,,,,,,,,

Periodontal disease indices obtained at day 1 included site-specific measures of attachment loss and clinical assessment of disease status. Using a residualized change score analysis, periodontal disease status and attachment loss were positively correlated with increases in the proportional recovery of Staphylococcus sp. from supragingival sites and total yeast from supra- and subgingival sites.

This form of the receptor was converted to the mature form of 93 kDa with a half-time of about 40-60 min. Both the immature (85 kDa) and mature (93 kDa) receptors associated as dimers, the native form of the receptor. The 85-kDa, as well as the 93-kDa, receptors bound to a monoclonal antibody raised against the transferrin receptor or to transferrin-Sepharose. In order to determine whether glycosylation was necessary for ligand binding, purified receptors were isolated from cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin. When K562 cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin, an 80-kDa nonglycosylated form of the receptor was synthesized. This nonglycosylated receptor was also capable of dimer formation; however, much less of it reached the cell surface than the fully glycosylated form, although both untreated and tunicamycin-grown cells appeared to synthesize transferrin receptors at similar rates. Although the number of receptor molecules/cell was similar in control and tunicamycin-treated cells, the nonglycosylated receptors exhibited a much lower affinity for transferrin than those of untreated cells; in contrast, when receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation and digested with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, no difference was observed between the affinity of these receptors and undigested immunoprecipitated receptors. These results suggest that glycosylation is not necessary for specific binding of transferrin to its receptor, but the affinity of this binding can be influenced greatly by the presence or absence of carbohydrate residues.","['Hunt, R C', 'Riegler, R', 'Davis, A A']","['Hunt RC', 'Riegler R', 'Davis AA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Carolina Medical School, Columbia 29208.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sepharose/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tunicamycin']",1989/06/05 00:00,1989/06/05 00:01,['1989/06/05 00:00'],"['1989/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)60579-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jun 5;264(16):9643-8.,"['CA 40150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY 06164/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal half contains more acidic than basic residues and includes several potential transmembrane regions which may anchor the holoprotein in the granule membrane. The cytotoxic action of BPI is limited to many species of Gram-negative bacteria; this specificity may be explained by a strong affinity of the very basic aminoterminal half for the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides that are unique to the Gram-negative bacterial envelope.

Evidence for cell-specific DNA elements within the proximal promoter region and cis-acting DNA elements upstream of -160.,9171-9,"Regulation of albumin gene expression is believed to be mediated by multiple nuclear factors that interact with cis-acting DNA sequences within the first 160 base pairs (bp) of the promoter. The minimal promoter sequence required to generate tissue-specific expression has not been clearly defined. We have constructed a series of transient expression vectors containing progressive deletions of the mouse albumin gene 5'-flanking sequence fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and include the Moloney murine leukemia viral (Mo-MuLV) enhancer. Promoter activity was determined in mouse hepatoma and fibroblast cell lines by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and S1 nuclease analyses. All constructions were compared with -623 Albcat-Mo-MuLV which contains all the sequence homology between the rat and mouse promoters. Low levels of expression were observed with -60 Albcat-Mo-MuLV (10%) in hepatoma but not fibroblast cells. Addition of promoter sequence to -208 bp progressively increased activity to 190% in the hepatoma cells, while -308 and -1612 Albcat-Mo-MuLV had activity similar to the -623 Albcat-Mo-MuLV level, and -3000 Albcat-Mo-MuLV showed a 2-fold reduction in transcriptional activity. The inclusion of promoter sequences upstream of -60 generated low levels of expression in the fibroblasts. We also show that factors from mouse liver nuclear extracts protect at least five regions of the albumin promoter upstream of -160. Our results indicate that tissue specificity is established within the proximal promoter region and that additional cis-acting elements that may have a functional role in the efficiency of albumin gene expression are located upstream of -160 bp.","['Izban, M G', 'Papaconstantinou, J']","['Izban MG', 'Papaconstantinou J']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Albumins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1989/06/05 00:00,1989/06/05 00:01,['1989/06/05 00:00'],"['1989/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)60510-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Jun 5;264(16):9171-9.,"['CA11701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11702/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA3147204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,['GENBANK/J04738'],,,,,

Analysis by immunoprecipitation shows that the viral capsid protein is part of the active nucleoprotein complex, but recognition of the complex by only a subset of anti-capsid sera implies that the protein is constrained conformationally. The viral DNA within this structure is accessible to nucleases; the effects of nucleases on the integrity of the complex suggest that the integration-competent particle is derived from and similar to the core of extracellular virions.","['Bowerman, B', 'Brown, P O', 'Bishop, J M', 'Varmus, H E']","['Bowerman B', 'Brown PO', 'Bishop JM', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics; University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleoproteins/*physiology', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.3.4.469 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1989 Apr;3(4):469-78. doi: 10.1101/gad.3.4.469.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now identified an additional common proviral integration site, called pim-2, that carries somatically acquired proviruses in the majority of transplanted tumors. In primary tumors integration near pim-2 is usually undetectable or present in only a minor fraction of the tumor cells. This subpopulation selectively grows out upon transplantation. Insertion near pim-2 is a relatively late event in tumorigenesis and is often preceded by proviral insertions in other common insertion sites, yielding tumor clones which carry proviruses in up to three different common insertion sites within the same cell (c-myc, pim-1 and pim-2). The data suggest that pim-2 plays an important role in tumor progression.","['Breuer, M L', 'Cuypers, H T', 'Berns, A']","['Breuer ML', 'Cuypers HT', 'Berns A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,,IM,"['Animals', '*Attachment Sites, Microbiological', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/microbiology', '*Lysogeny', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1989 Mar;8(3):743-8.,,,PMC400870,,,,,,,,,

A comparative investigation of the genotoxicity of Compounds I and III using primary cultures of fetal hamster lung cells revealed an about 14-fold higher rate of DNA single-strand breaks following exposure (100 microM, 1 h) to Compound I as compared to Compound III. The rate of DNA interstrand cross-links, on the other hand, was 11-fold higher following Compound III as compared to Compound I. The results underline that the therapeutic activity of chloroethylnitrosoureas is mainly attributable to their cross-linking potential while induction of DNA single-strand breaks plays a decisive role for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity but appears not to be relevant for antineoplastic effectiveness.","['Zeller, W J', 'Fruhauf, S', 'Chen, G', 'Eisenbrand, G', 'Lijinsky, W']","['Zeller WJ', 'Fruhauf S', 'Chen G', 'Eisenbrand G', 'Lijinsky W']","['Institute of Toxicology and Chemotherapy, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '106612-15-1 (1-nitroso-1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxypropyl)urea)', '96806-34-7 (1-nitroso-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-(2-chloroethyl)urea)', '96806-35-8 (1-nitroso-1-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-(2-chloroethyl)urea)', 'NAT2FD82D7 (elmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 15;49(12):3267-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice bearing L5178Y leukemia were given a 48-h s.c. infusion of high-dose ara-U (HiDAU) to achieve a plasma level of 0.5 to 1 mM. A total dose of 7.35 g/kg/day for 2 days was nontoxic; the mean survival of control (saline treated) leukemic mice was 12.2 +/- 1.8 days and 11.7 +/- 2.0 days for the HiDAU-treated leukemic mice. Using flow cytometry, cell cycle progression of L5178Y ascites cells was monitored during HiDAU infusion. At 48 h, the proliferative index (PI) percentage of the leukemic cells is significantly different (P less than 0.001) in HiDAU-treated leukemic mice (mean = 50.8) versus control (mean = 45.6). A higher PI percentage is associated with accumulation of cells in S phase. This effect was highly variable in the ara-U-treated mice, and the ara-U ""perturbed"" group was defined as those mice whose cells had an increase in the PI to greater than or equal to 50%. The higher PI percentage in HiDAU-treated mice correlated with HiCAU in ascites fluid, leukemic cells, and kidney of perturbed mice. HiCAU in the ""ara-U-perturbed"" group altered the plasma pharmacokinetics of high-dose ara-C (HiDAC, 1 g/kg), increased the cellular metabolism of ara-C to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytidine triphosphate (ara-CTP) (3-fold), and increased ara-C-DNA synthesis (3-fold). In mice bearing the L5178Y leukemia, a 48-h infusion of ara-U followed by a 24-h s.c. infusion of 40 mg/kg resulted in a 260% increase in life span and seven 90-day survivors among 16 treated mice. In contrast, ara-U or ara-C alone had a negligible therapeutic effect. ara-U-induced alterations in the systemic pharmacokinetics of ara-C are the result of inhibition of cytidine deaminase activity by HiCAU in liver and kidneys. This results in a decrease in ara-C catabolism and prolongs the plasma half-life of ara-C. The dual alteration of the pharmacokinetics of ara-C and cytokinetics of the leukemia cells by HiCAU results in enhanced survival of leukemic mice. These results may help explain the clinical utility of HiDAC treatment programs for patients with acute leukemia.","['Chandrasekaran, B', 'Capizzi, R L', 'Kute, T E', 'Morgan, T', 'Dimling, J']","['Chandrasekaran B', 'Capizzi RL', 'Kute TE', 'Morgan T', 'Dimling J']","['Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 15;49(12):3259-66.,['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The loss of inhibition after this time seen previously (A.H. Merrill, Jr., A.M. Sereni, V.L. Stevens, Y.A. Hannun, R.M. Bell, and J.M. Kinkade, Jr., J. Biol. Chem., 261: 12610-12615, 1986), which appeared to be due to metabolism of this long-chain base, was overcome by supplying sphinganine daily. After 4 days, phorbol myristate acetate-induced adherence was inhibited approximately 50% by sphinganine. Sphinganine significantly decreased the expression of nonspecific esterase induced by phorbol myristate acetate in the nonadherent cells, indicating that other aspects of maturation besides adherence were blocked. The effects of daily sphinganine treatments on the monocytic differentiation induced by 1 alpha-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or ganglioside GM3 were also investigated. The increases in nonspecific esterase expression, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and morphological maturation caused by either agent were unaffected by the long-chain base. In addition, the changes in several cell surface antigens caused by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were unaltered by sphinganine. Although phorbol esters, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and ganglioside GM3 all induce the maturation of HL-60 cells along the monocytic lineage, the finding that sphinganine only affected the differentiation initiated by phorbol esters, in which protein kinase C clearly is a major regulator, suggests that this enzyme does not play a major role in these other pathways of differentiation.","['Stevens, V L', 'Winton, E F', 'Smith, E E', 'Owens, N E', 'Kinkade, J M Jr', 'Merrill, A H Jr']","['Stevens VL', 'Winton EF', 'Smith EE', 'Owens NE', 'Kinkade JM Jr', 'Merrill AH Jr']","['Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Gangliosides)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/*pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1989/06/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 15;49(12):3229-34.,"['CA22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33369/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Both lines are highly resistant to ara-C and have maintained stable resistance for more than 18 mo. The resistance in PER-164 cells is the result of a selection process in vivo only, while PER-163 cells have in addition been exposed to ara-C in culture. Comparison with cell line PER-145, which is sensitive to ara-C and was established from the same patient before HDara-C therapy, revealed no differences with respect to surface markers, morphology, cytochemical stains, or requirements for growth in vitro. The leukemic origin of the three cell lines is indicated by the close similarities of all three cell lines to the patient's fresh cells. The analysis of the two resistant cell lines shows that resistance to ara-C is not due to lower ara-C transport capacity nor to cytokinetic reasons, since the percentage of cells in S-phase is similar in all three cell lines. In addition, the resistant cell lines do not show any increased cytidine deaminase activity. PER-164 cells show a markedly reduced deoxycytidine kinase activity, 4.8 nmol/h/mg of protein, compared to PER-145 cells with an enzyme activity of 21.48 nmol/h/mg of protein. In PER-163 cells, no deoxycytidine kinase activity could be detected. Furthermore, the two resistant cell lines show significantly different dCTP levels. The sensitive PER-145 cells generated 97.9 pmol of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate (ara-CTP)/10(7) cells during a 45-min incubation period in the presence of 10(-6) M ara-C. This contrasts with 0.16 and 12 pmol of ara-CTP/10(7) cells for PER-163 and PER-164 cells, respectively. These investigations suggest that cell phenotypes with distinct features can be generated after HDara-C treatment and that decreased deoxycytidine kinase activity appears to be one of the major mechanisms of resistance.","['Kees, U R', 'Ford, J', 'Dawson, V M', 'Piall, E', 'Aherne, G W']","['Kees UR', 'Ford J', 'Dawson VM', 'Piall E', 'Aherne GW']","['Clinical Immunology Research Unit, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/metabolism', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 1;49(11):3015-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each exhibited potent in vitro toxicity and in vivo efficacy against murine and human tumor cells. Concentrations of each that inhibited replication of cultured murine lymphoma P388 cells by 50% were 5 nM or less. Mycalamide-A and -B were also potent inhibitors of HL-60, HT-29, and A549 human tumor cell replication (50% inhibitory concentration less than 5 nM), while values for onnamide were greater (50% inhibitory concentrations between 25 and 200 nM). Mycalamide-A (10 micrograms/kg) and -B (2.5 micrograms/kg) were moderately active against P388 leukemia (increase in life span, approximately 50%), while onnamide was inactive (40 micrograms/kg; increase in life span, 15%). Mycalamide-A was also active against B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, M5076 ovarian sarcoma, colon 26 carcinoma, and the human MX-1, CX-1, and Burkitt's lymphoma tumor xenografts. Mechanism of action studies indicate that the three agents inhibited protein synthesis. For example, after 1-h exposures to 20 nM mycalamide-A and -B, the rates of [3H]leucine incorporation into acid-precipitable material of cultured P388 cells were inhibited 54 and 99%, while the effects on incorporation of [3H]uridine and [3H]thymidine were less. The relative effects of 20 to 2000 nM mycalamide-A on protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis were consistent with those observed during exposure of P388 cells to 1 microM emetine, a known inhibitor of protein synthesis. Also, the three agents inhibited translation of RNA into protein in a cell-free lysate of rabbit reticulocytes. Although mycalamide-A disrupted DNA metabolism, the agent apparently did not intercalate into DNA, and a mixture of four deoxynucleosides (250 microM each) did not decrease the antiproliferative effects of the agent. Collectively, these data indicate that this class of compounds represents novel antitumor agents which should be further evaluated to define their potential.","['Burres, N S', 'Clement, J J']","['Burres NS', 'Clement JJ']","['Division of Biomedical Marine Research, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Inc., Ft.

The nuclei of the cells were positively stained. The N-myc gene product was not detected in the normal part of the retina or in other parts of the eye. The results suggested that the level of the N-myc gene product may be inversely correlated with the differentiation of retinoblastoma cells and that the detection of the N-myc gene product may be useful in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Because the undifferentiated form of retinoblastoma carries a worse prognosis than the differentiated forms, the level of the N-myc gene product may be related to the aggressiveness of the tumor cells.

Simplified analogues of ellipticine derivatives.",1395-406,"The interrelationship between affinity for DNA, cytotoxicity and induction of single-strand DNA breaks in cultured L1210 cells was studied for 21 compounds belonging to two series of tricyclic intercalators: 1-amino-substituted 4-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indoles (gamma CARB) and 1-amino-substituted 4-methyl-5H-pyrido[3',4':4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridines (PPP), which are simplified analogues of Ellipticine derivatives obtained by deletion of one cycle. Adriamycin, m-AMSA (4'-(9-acridinylamino) methanesulfon-m-anisidide), PZE (10-[diethylaminopropyl amino]-6-methyl-5H-pyrido[3',4':4,5]-pyrrolo[2,3-g] isoquinoline and RTE [( 1-(3-diethylaminopropylamino)-9-methoxy ellipticine, bimaleate) are used as reference compounds. The intercalation of these compounds into DNA was strongly suggested by three experimental observations: (i) the competitive inhibition of ethidium bromide intercalation, (ii) bathochromic and hypochromic effects on absorption spectra induced by DNA, and (iii) drug-induced increase of the DNA length, measured by viscosimetry. PPP derivatives are generally less cytotoxic and induce DNA breaks less efficiently than the gamma CARB ones, both in terms of maximum breakage frequencies and required drug concentrations. The most active compounds induced SSB in the DNA of L1210 cells, in a bell-shaped manner: the SSB frequency increased, rose to a maximum and then decreased as the drug concentrations increased. The maximum SSB frequencies induced by the most active compounds are of the same order as those of reference compounds Adriamycin and PZE. The structurally important requirements are essentially the same for both DNA breakage activity and cytotoxicity: (i) a N-CH3 in the 5-position, (ii) a CH3 in the 4-position, (iii) a hydroxy in the 8-position and (iv) the presence of an (aminoalkyl)amino side chain with preferentially a 3 carbon unit. There is no direct relationship between DNA affinity in vitro and induction of DNA breaks in cells, although a relatively high affinity seemed to be a necessary condition, since the most active compounds have the highest affinities and compounds having a very low affinity are totally inactive. The close correlation between cytotoxicity and extent of induction of DNA breaks suggests that these breaks may be in fact the lethal lesions responsible for cell death and thereby for the antitumor properties of these tricyclic intercalators.","['Pierson, V', 'Pierre, A', 'de Cointet, P', 'Nguyen, C H', 'Bisagni, E', 'Gros, P']","['Pierson V', 'Pierre A', 'de Cointet P', 'Nguyen CH', 'Bisagni E', 'Gros P']","['Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(89)90178-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90178-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 May 1;38(9):1395-406. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90178-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, addition of allogeneic or autologous Mos to the LD-T-Mo cultures restored the NAP synthesis.

Some studies have suggested that a disturbance in the normal asymmetric distribution of PS--e.g., PS exposure in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, which can occur upon platelet activation as well as in certain pathologic red cells--serves as a potent procoagulant surface and as a signal for triggering their recognition by macrophages. These studies suggest that the regulation of PS distribution in cell membranes may be critical in controlling coagulation and in determining the survival of pathologic cells in the circulation. In this paper we describe a sensitive technique, based on PS-dependent prothrombinase complex activity, for assessing the amount of PS on the external leaflet of intact viable cells. Our results indicate that tumorigenic, undifferentiated murine erythroleukemic cells express 7- to 8-fold more PS in their outer leaflet than do their differentiated, nontumorigenic counterparts. Increased expression of PS in the tumorigenic cells directly correlated with their ability to be recognized and bound by macrophages.","['Connor, J', 'Bucana, C', 'Fidler, I J', 'Schroit, A J']","['Connor J', 'Bucana C', 'Fidler IJ', 'Schroit AJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas M.

Synergistic inhibition was obtained when both 1,10-phenanthroline and hydroxyurea was used in combination at relatively nontoxic concentrations.

The most common underlying malignancies were genitourinary and gynecological tumors, acute leukemia, and gastrointestinal malignancies. Most patients (94%) were febrile, and septic shock was documented in 24% of monomicrobial episodes and in 58% of those with polymicrobial infection. Soft-tissue infection was present in 44% of the cases, and it presented as tissue necrosis in 11%. The most common sites identified as the portal of entry were intra-abdominal abscesses, soft tissue, and the oropharynx. The most common organisms were Bacteroides fragilis (57%) and other Bacteroides spp. (22%). Most polymicrobial infections were caused by 2 organisms, the second most commonly another anaerobe or an aerobic gram-negative bacillus. The most active antibiotic in vitro was chloramphenicol. High rates of resistance to penicillin were observed not only among B. fragilis, but also among Bacteroides spp. The frequency of penicillin resistance increased throughout the study years. The overall survival was 70%. The cure rate for monomicrobial bacteremias was 76% vs. 51% for polymicrobial episodes. Infection was the cause of death in 20 and 16 episodes, respectively. The response rate for patients in septic shock was 47% in contrast to an 85% recovery rate for those without it. Ninety-five patients had documented abscesses accompanying the bacteremic episode. The most effective antibiotics were clindamycin and chloramphenicol. Overall response to penicillin was only 13%. Suboptimal responses were also observed for the antipseudomonal penicillins.

Prior to cell sorting the DNA has been fluorochrome-labeled with the Hoechst stain H 33342. Maximum cell enrichments of 94% for G0 + G1 cells, 96% for S cells and 74% for G2 + M cells could be achieved. The enzyme activities of thymidine kinase (TK), thymidylate synthase (TS), DNA polymerase (DNA-P), dihydrofolate reductase (FH2-R), methionine synthase (MS), and hexokinase (HK) were determined in the obtained cell fractions. Although incorporation of 3H-thymidine (3H-dTR) and the 3H-dTR labeling index were significantly inhibited by the dye, no evidence of cell staining's having a significant effect on the enzyme activities was found. The enzyme activities for approximately 100% pure G0 + G1, S, and G2 + M cells were computed. With exception of TK, all the enzymes under study were shown to exhibit activities--although of differing degree--in the G0 + G1, S, and G2 + M cells. No TK activity was shown in G0 and G1 cells; its activity, however, was approximately the same in S and G2 + M cells. This applies likewise for TS which, in contrast to TK, exhibits minor activity in G0 + G1 cells. DNA-P was highly active in G0 + G1 cells, but maximum activity was in S cells. FH2-R exhibited maximum activity in S cells, although the difference in activity between S and G2 + M cells was not significant. None of the observed differences in MS activity was significant, indicating equally high activity in cells of all cell cycle phases. HK activity is approximately twice as high in G2 + M cells as in G0 + G1 cells.","['Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Fleischer, W', 'Wilmanns, W', 'Sauer, H', 'Schalhorn, A']","['Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Fleischer W', 'Wilmanns W', 'Sauer H', 'Schalhorn A']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grosshadern der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Thymidine Kinase/analysis']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):380-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody was derived from a mouse immunized with live human leukemic myeloblasts. Specificity of binding of mAb M195 was determined by protein-A red blood cell rosetting assays, immunoabsorption, radioimmunoassays with iodine-125 labeled M195 IgG and F(Ab)'2, and complement cytotoxicity with live human cells and cell lines representing a broad range of lineages and tissues. Antigen expression was restricted to myeloid and monocytic leukemia cell lines and a fraction of mature adherent monocytes. Mature myeloid cells, T and B cells, erythrocytes, and platelets were negative. The antigen was not expressed on adult human tissues in immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence assays. Blocking antigen was not found in the serum of patients with ANLL. Ten thousand sites per cell were expressed on myeloid or monocytic leukemia cell lines and 5000 sites per cell on mature monocytes. M195 IgG bound to its antigen target with an avidity of 3 x 10(9) liters/mol and induced rapid modulation of the antigen. M195 IgG was able to effectively kill cells with rabbit or guinea pig complement, but not human complement. The antibody did not mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The molecular nature of the target antigen remains unknown but it appears to be carried on the CD33 protein p67. Because of its restricted distribution on myelomonocytic cells, mAb M195 may be useful in studying myeloid differentiation, in the clinical diagnosis of ANLL, in purging of bone marrow of ANLL, and/or in monoclonal antibody therapy in vivo.","['Tanimoto, M', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Cordon-Cardo, C', 'Huie, D', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Old, L J']","['Tanimoto M', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Huie D', 'Clarkson BD', 'Old LJ']","['Laboratory of Human Cancer Immunology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 May;3(5):339-48.,['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 14 patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 11 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), four with non-PV erythrocytosis, two with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, as well as three normal fetuses and greater than 25 normal adults. Endogenous, i.e. grew without added erythropoietin, bone marrow CFU-E-derived colonies were observed in all but one PV patient. However, endogenous blood BFU-E-derived bursts were observed in only eight of 14 PV patients. Endogenous erythroid colonies were not seen in cultures from any normal adults or fetuses, or patients with CML, erythrocytosis, or myeloid metaplasia. In PV, relative HbF synthesis was always greater in cultures without erythropoietin, while in cultures from all other patients relative HbF synthesis was similar to that observed in cultures from normal individuals. We conclude that PV and CML are distinguishable in culture since CML patients do not have endogenous growth. Most important, endogenous bone marrow CFU-E-derived colonies are the only consistently unique observation in patients with PV, and endogenous CFU-E- and BFU-E-derived colonies and bursts are not uniformly observed in PV blood cultures. In-vitro studies of erythropoiesis to confirm the diagnosis of PV, therefore, require marrow when endogenous colonies and bursts are absent from blood cultures.","['Weinberg, R S', 'Worsley, A', 'Gilbert, H S', 'Cuttner, J', 'Berk, P D', 'Alter, B P']","['Weinberg RS', 'Worsley A', 'Gilbert HS', 'Cuttner J', 'Berk PD', 'Alter BP']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroblasts/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia/blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood/pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90070-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(4):331-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90070-2.,['HL26132/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Eight of them had MDS, 2 acute leukemia (M3, M4), 1 chronic myelogenous leukemia and 2 primary myelofibrosis. All patients were untreated except for 3 patients (PASA, RAEB, AML-M4) who had been treated with mepitiostane, prednisolone and BH.AC-AMP regimen, respectively, prior to alfacalcidol therapy. All patients received alfacalcidol orally for at least one month. The dosage of alfacalcidol ranged from 0.25 to 10 micrograms/day, and the medicine was administrated intermittently when the dosage exceeded 6 micrograms/day to prevent hypercalcemia. The therapeutic effectiveness of alfacalcidol was evaluated according to a criteria by Koeffler (Cancer Treat Rep 69: 1399, 1985) with minor modifications. Three patients (PASA, RAEB, CMML) showed partial response, 3 (RAEB, RAEB in T, AML-M4) minor response and rest of the patients did not respond. The hematological improvement of 6 responders was transient (from 1 to 2 months), however, one patient (PASA) is still responding to alfacalcidol therapy (0.25 microgram/day) for over 12 months. The dysplastic features of hemopoietic cells in the bone marrow showed no noticeable change during the hematological improvement in these responders, suggesting the improvement was obtained as a result of alteration in the proliferation or differentiation of neoplastic clone. None of 13 patients developed hypercalcemia. One patient (AML-M4) became excitable on high dose alfacalcidol (10 micrograms/day). In conclusion, alfacalcidol therapy is effective in some patients with MDS or leukemias and appears worthy especially in the clinical state in which chemotherapy is not indicated.","['Takahashi, T', 'Ichiba, S', 'Okuno, Y', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Sakai, Y', 'Imura, H', 'Iho, S', 'Hoshino, T', 'Suzuki, A', 'Okada, T']","['Takahashi T', 'Ichiba S', 'Okuno Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Sakai Y', 'Imura H', 'Iho S', 'Hoshino T', 'Suzuki A', 'Okada T', 'et al.']",,['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Hydroxycholecalciferols)', 'URQ2517572 (alfacalcidol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 Jan;30(1):1-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost all patients received induction therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C) according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) AML 5 to AML 9 trials. Bone marrow samples from 116 representative patients were obtained for CFU-L assay with an efficiency percentage of 89.6%; 76 patients had a measurement of the CFU-L self-renewal capacity (second plating efficiency [PE2]) and 91 patients had CFU-L inhibition test after exposure to DNR and/or Ara-C. The prognostic significance of parameters such as age, hematological antecedent, WBC count, liver enlargement, and Auer rods is confirmed in the present study. Moreover, high platelet and polymorphonuclear counts appeared to be related to resistance to induction course. However, through multivariate analysis, CFU-L sensitivity to drugs and self-renewal capacity appeared to be major independent prognostic factors in AML. A low CFU-L inhibition in the presence of the DNR and Ara-C combination correlates with a poorer complete remission (CR) rate, but not with CR duration. Patients with the lower PE2 values experienced both higher CR rate and longer CR duration. The practical interest of CFU-L study remains to be defined but, at least, PE2 measurement could be considered in the future as a major variable in determining therapeutic aggressiveness.","['Delmer, A', 'Marie, J P', 'Thevenin, D', 'Cadiou, M', 'Viguie, F', 'Zittoun, R']","['Delmer A', 'Marie JP', 'Thevenin D', 'Cadiou M', 'Viguie F', 'Zittoun R']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral, Combined)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Combined', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.6.738 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Jun;7(6):738-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.6.738.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The order of the inhibitory potency was TPA greater than GM3 greater than DMSO greater than BBG greater than GM1. In contrast, sulfatides were without effect on cellular replication. Treatment of HL-60 cells with TPA or GM3 induced differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage lineage, while treatment with DMSO induced maturation along the granulocytic pathway. These effects were accompanied by more than a twofold increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity. In contrast, treatment with GM1, BBG, or sulfatides caused only a relatively small increase in PKC activity. The activity of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:lactosylceramide sialyltransferase (ST1), a key enzyme for membrane gangliosides synthesis, in HL-60 cells was also influenced by the exposure to TPA, GM3, DMSO, GM1, or sulfatides. The inducers of differentiation, TPA and DMSO, caused an increase in ST1 activity, whereas GM3, which also induced cellular differentiation, inhibited ST1 activity, perhaps through the action of end-product inhibition. The non-inducers of differentiation, GM1 and sulfatides, also increased the activity of ST1, but to a much lesser extent. The findings suggest that the direct or indirect modulation of PKC activity by some of these agents may be involved, at least in part, in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. Furthermore, it is conceivable that differences in PKC activity may be responsible for the changes in ST1 activity associated with cell differentiation and proliferation.","['Xia, X J', 'Gu, X B', 'Sartorelli, A C', 'Yu, R K']","['Xia XJ', 'Gu XB', 'Sartorelli AC', 'Yu RK']","['Department of Neurology, Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.9 (haematoside synthetase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/*pharmacology', 'Glycosphingolipids/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-2275(20)38379-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1989 Feb;30(2):181-8.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-11835/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['J Lipid Res 1989 Apr;30(4):631.

Combinations of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 resulted in a synergistic suppression of colony formation by erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E) and an additive suppression of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells. In addition, TGF-beta 1 synergized with rIFN-alpha to suppress CFU-GM formation, while the combined suppressive effects of both cytokines on CFU-GEMM and BFU-E were additive. When TGF-beta 1 was tested with TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha on granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-stimulated bone marrow cells in a 5-day proliferation assay, the antiproliferative effects of TGF-beta 1 and TNF-alpha were additive, while those with TGF-beta 1 and rIFN-alpha were synergistic. A similar pattern was seen in the suppression of the myeloblastic cell line KG-1 where TGF-beta 1 in combination with TNF-alpha resulted in an additive suppression while inhibition by TGF-beta 1 and IFN-alpha was synergistic. These results demonstrate for the first time the cooperative effects between TGF-beta and TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha in the suppression of hematopoietic cell growth, raising the possibility that TGF-beta might be used in concert with TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha in the treatment of various myeloproliferative disorders.","['Sing, G K', 'Keller, J R', 'Ellingsworth, L R', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Sing GK', 'Keller JR', 'Ellingsworth LR', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240390203 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1989 Feb;39(2):107-15. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240390203.,['N01-CO74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have assessed the role of the antigen GM2 on melanoma cells as a recognition structure for lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. LAK cells were generated by stimulation of non-adherent peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from human donors with recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2). The selection of target cells was based on GM2 content and included 11 human melanoma cell lines and 2 human leukemia lines. Using a single-cell binding assay, LAK cell binding to target lines expressing high levels of GM2 was significantly greater than to those expressing minimum GM2. This cell-binding was specifically inhibited by addition of purified GM2 but not by other gangliosides. LAK-melanoma cell-binding was also specifically inhibited by anti-GM2 monoclonal antibody (MAb). For further analysis LAK cell lysis of melanoma target cells expressing various amounts of GM2 was assessed. A significant correlation occurred with GM2 expression and LAK cell lysis (p less than 0.025; r = 0.623). Three other gangliosides commonly expressed on human melanoma, GM3, GD3 and GD2, had no correlation with LAK cell lysis. These studies suggest that GM2 on melanoma cells is a marker for LAK cell sensitivity, as well as indicate that GM2 is a potential target recognition structure for human LAK cells.","['Hoon, D S', 'Ando, I', 'Sviland, G', 'Tsuchida, T', 'Okun, E', 'Morton, D L', 'Irie, R F']","['Hoon DS', 'Ando I', 'Sviland G', 'Tsuchida T', 'Okun E', 'Morton DL', 'Irie RF']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Armand Hammer Laboratories, John Wayne Cancer Clinic, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '19600-01-2 (G(M2) Ganglioside)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'G(M2) Ganglioside/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Gangliosides/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*immunology', 'Melanoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology/metabolism']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910430520 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 May 15;43(5):857-62. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910430520.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Staurosporine and CGP 41 251 exerted growth inhibition in the human bladder carcinoma line T-24, human promyelocytic leukemia line HL-60 and bovine corneal endothelial cells at concentrations which correlated well with in vitro PKC inhibition.

IFN alpha alone inhibited the growth of HL-60 leukemic cells only at concentrations greater than 1000 U/ml, whereas with cimetidine, inhibition was seen at greater than 1 U/ml of IFN alpha. The enhancing effect of cimetidine on IFN alpha inhibition of clonal growth was neutralized by histamine and was not seen with histamine H1 receptor antagonist. In HL-60 cells, cimetidine also increased the enzymatic activity of (2'-5')-oligoadenylate synthetase, induced by IFN alpha. The combination of cimetidine and IFN alpha had a synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth of leukemic granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) from chronic myeloid leukemia patients, normal CFU-GM, and normal erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) progenitors.

The PALA/cytidine synergy is confirmed here in other human tumor cells (T242 melanoma, HL60 promyelocytic leukemia and SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma) in the cytidine concentration range of 1-10 micromolar. The synergy was not observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Exogenous uridine (5-50 microM) completely reversed the PALA/cytidine cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Measurements of cellular ribonucleotide levels revealed that the PALA treated cells had reduced UTP and CTP pools (10% and 40% of control respectively); and the PALA/cytidine treated cells had elevated CTP and GTP levels while their UTP levels remained at 10% of control. Deoxyribonucleotide levels were unremarkable except for a slight elevation of dCTP in the PALA/cytidine treated cells. Uridine competitively inhibited radioactive cytidine transport into 2008 cells, which may explain its ability to antagonize the PALA/cytidine synergy. These results suggest that the ribonucleotide biosynthetic mechanism is the primary cellular target for PALA/cytidine activity, and that the ratio of ribonucleotides to each other is an important determinant of tumor cell viability.

N-Substituted dehydroalanines (indexed as AD compounds) are capto-dative olefins which react and scavenge free radicals, especially the superoxide anion (O2-) and hydroxyl radical (HO). AD-20, an orthomethoxyphenylacetyl dehydroalanine derivative, decreases the mortality of mice when administered before an acute single dose or multiple non-toxic doses of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin administered to mice induces elevated serum transaminase levels, and the pretreatment of mice with AD-20 decreases significantly these serum enzymatic activities. Preliminary histological examinations suggest that these serum transaminase elevations reflect most likely liver injury. In addition to its cardiotoxicity, doxorubicin induces a severe bone marrow depletion. Although this initial decrease in the peripheral leukocytes induced by doxorubicin is not prevented by the administration of AD-20, it produces a fast recuperation in the white blood cells levels after 1 week, supporting a protective effect at this level. Moreover, the antitumor effect of doxorubicin in L1210 tumor-bearing mice was enhanced when AD-20 was injected before doxorubicin. We postulate that these effects may be related to the free radical scavenging ability of AD-20.","['Buc-Calderon, P', 'Praet, M', 'Ruysschaert, J M', 'Roberfroid, M']","['Buc-Calderon P', 'Praet M', 'Ruysschaert JM', 'Roberfroid M']","['Unite de Biochimie Toxicologique et Cancerologique, Ecole de Pharmacie, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['111542-07-5 (AD 20)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(89)90204-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1989 Apr;25(4):679-85. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(89)90204-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

For P388 murine or HL-60 human leukemia cells exposed to DNR (1 micrograms/ml, 60 min), log intracellular DNR content varied in direct proportion to log cell volume measured by flow cytometry, with a correlation coefficient of .9. This relationship was confirmed by cell sorting based on intracellular DNR content with subsequent volume determination of the sorted cells. Normalization of intracellular DNR content for cell volume (thus obtaining intracellular DNR concentration) was accomplished by subtracting log cell volume from log intracellular DNR content for each cell. This resulted in a 34% decrease (range 23-58%) in standard deviation compared to DNR content measurements without volume normalization for all cell types tested. Following exposure to DNR (as above), intracellular DNR content of drug-sensitive P388 or HL-60 cells measured by flow cytometry was 12- and 8-fold greater than that of the multidrug-resistant sublines P388/ADR and HL-60/AR, respectively. However, because of the variance of intracellular DNR content, the predictive value of flow-cytometric determination of intracellular DNR content as a discriminant assay for detecting the frequency of drug-resistant cells in a mixed population was acceptable only when the frequency of resistant cells in the population exceeded 10%.

Since the membrane transporter mediates both the influx and the efflux of nucleosides, dipyridamole should be able to block nucleoside efflux from cells as well. In human ovarian carcinoma cells (2008) and promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60), we observed that sequential treatment with 20 microM dipyridamole 2 h after their initial exposure to varying concentrations of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) increased the cytotoxicity of this nucleoside analogue by 100 to 300% at all drug concentrations tested. In washout experiments in which cells were exposed to radiolabeled ara-C for 2 h and reincubated in fresh medium, the presence of 20 microM dipyridamole in the reincubation medium resulted in significantly elevated levels of intracellular radioactivity at the end of a 24-h period. High performance liquid chromatography analyses of cellular nucleotide pools during this 24-h period revealed that cells treated with the sequential ara-C/dipyridamole regimen have 2-to 3-fold higher levels of ara-CTP at all time points studied. Using alkaline elution assays, we measured a 30% increase in DNA strand breaks in cells treated with ara-C followed by dipyridamole when compared to cells treated with ara-C alone, while dipyridamole alone did not produce DNA lesions. ara-C resistance in tumor cells is associated with either the natural substrates competing with ara-C for phosphorylation and incorporation into macromolecules or increased catabolism of the parent drug. Sequential exposure regimens may overcome such tumor resistance by increasing the cellular pools of ara-C and its metabolites. A second advantage to the sequential regimen is that the prolonged retention of ara-C in non-S-phase cells may improve its efficacy.

F. Worzalla, and M. J. Sweeney, Pyrazofurin inhibition of purine biosynthesis via 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate formyltransferase. Cancer Res., 40: 1482-1485, 1980). Measurement of levels of pyrimidine and purine intermediates in cultured mouse L1210 leukemia cells has shown that 25 microM pyrazofurin induces an 8-fold accumulation of OMP and large accumulations of intermediates proximal to the blockade with abrupt decreases in uridine and cytidine nucleotides. Considerable increases in the cellular concentrations of N-succino-AICAR (SAICAR), AICAR, 5-formamidoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (FAICAR), IMP, XMP, and GMP at later times indicate that AICAR transformylase is not significantly inhibited in cultured cells; rather the purine pathway and the GMP branch are stimulated. However, addition of 25 microM 3-deazauridine (NSC 126849) to leukemia cells did result in inhibition of AICAR transformylase: AICAR and SAICAR accumulated, IMP disappeared and there was a large accumulation of guanosine nucleotides. Blockade of pyrimidine biosynthesis by derivatives of pyrazofurin or 3-deazauridine spares 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and L-glutamine, elevated concentrations of which may stimulate initial reactions of purine biosynthesis and the reaction XMP----GMP.","['Sant, M E', 'Lyons, S D', 'Kemp, A J', 'McClure, L K', 'Szabados, E', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Sant ME', 'Lyons SD', 'Kemp AJ', 'McClure LK', 'Szabados E', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, N.S.W., Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', '4B15044GQZ (pyrazofurin)', '681HV46001 (Ribose)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.3 (Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', ""EC 4.1.1.23 (Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase)"", 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['3-Deazauridine/*pharmacology', 'Acyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amides', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Bicarbonates/metabolism', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', ""Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase', 'Purines/*biosynthesis', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Ribose', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 May 15;49(10):2645-50.,['A08415281/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas the majority of Ph-positive CML patients show the standard Ph translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), the minority of cases exhibit a variant type of Ph translocation involving these two and other chromosomes (complex type) or those involving #22 and chromosomes other than #9 (simple type). To get an insight into the nature of variant Ph translocations and the process of their formation, we examined the localization of the c-abl and c-sis oncogenes and the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene by chromosomal in situ hybridization in ten variant Ph translocations of CML including five simple and five complex ones as initially interpreted. In situ hybridization showed that c-abl localized to band 9q34 and c-sis localized to band 22q12-q13 were translocated on the Ph and on one of the rearranged chromosomes other than #9, respectively, in all the variant translocations examined. On the other hand, bcr localized to band 22q11 was translocated on various chromosomes but mostly on chromosome 9. Parallel Southern blot analyses on DNA from leukemic cells of five patients including two with simple translocations and three with complex ones revealed rearrangements of bcr with breakpoints occurring mostly in a 5' portion of 5.8-kb BamHI/BglII sequences, which are quite similar to those detected so far in CML cases with the standard Ph translocation. The present findings strongly suggest that variant Ph translocations of CML are all complex, and some of them are formed stepwisely from the standard translocation.","['Abe, S', 'Minamihisamatsu, M', 'Ishihara, T', 'Sasaki, M']","['Abe S', 'Minamihisamatsu M', 'Ishihara T', 'Sasaki M']","['Chromosome Research Unit, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(89)90166-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(89)90166-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1989 Mar;38(1):61-74. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(89)90166-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to minimize cell loss in cytopreparation, electrostatic binding of cells to poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated multispot slides, followed by immunocytochemistry, was investigated. Using optimized conditions of cell attachment and fixation and performing all washing procedures on the slide made multimarker analysis possible even in paucicellular specimens, while preserving excellent cell morphology and yielding high sensitivity in the detection of antigens. In a study of 26 CSF specimens with inconclusive cytomorphology, comprising 335 single marker determinations, we were able to discriminate reliably between resting or activated benign cells and a wide range of types of malignant lymphoid cell. A definitive diagnosis was reached in all cases by one tap only. Malignant meningitis was ruled out in ten specimens and proved in 16, including five in which the type of malignancy could only be determined by immunophenotyping. We conclude that immunocytochemistry on PLL-coated slides constitutes the method of choice for immunologic cell differentiation in CSF, which allows equivocal morphologic findings to be clarified.","['Kranz, B R', 'Thiel, E', 'Thierfelder, S']","['Kranz BR', 'Thiel E', 'Thierfelder S']","['Institut fur Immunologie, GSF, Munchen, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/analysis/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Lymphoma/analysis/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/analysis/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Meningitis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', '*Polylysine']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75510-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):1942-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expressions of CD25 (Tac), CD28, T9 (transferrin receptor), and Ki-67 (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) Ags were high, and that of CD7 Ag was low in both acute and chronic ATL cells compared with that in normal T cells. The expressions of T9 and Ki-67 Ags were higher in acute ATL cells than in chronic ATL cells. The expression of CD38 Ag was higher in acute ATL cells but not in chronic ATL cells compared with normal T cells. On the contrary, the expression of HLA-DR Ag on the cell surface and the transcript of the HLA-DR Ag gene were high in chronic ATL cells, but not in acute ATL cells. A high percentage of lymph node ATL cells expressed T9, CD38, and Ki-67 Ags, although the peripheral blood ATL cells of the same patients showed significantly lower levels of expression of the same Ags. Interestingly, CD7 and HLA-DR Ags were detected on the majority of lymph node ATL cells. Moderately high percentage of smoldering ATL cells expressed CD25, CD28, and HLA-DR Ags, though a few numbers of leukemic cells were present in the samples. These findings confirm that the modes of activation of ATL cells in different clinical stages differ, and suggest that the differences might be reflected in the clinical features. The low expression of HLA-DR Ag in acute ATL cells, despite high expression of the Ag in chronic ATL cells, suggests that successive events that suppress HLA-DR Ag expression are necessary for the transformation of chronic ATL cells into acute ATL cells. Moreover, the high expressions of T9, CD38, Ki-67, CD7, and HLA-DR Ags on lymph node ATL cells indicate that ATL cells preferentially proliferate in lymph nodes.","['Shirono, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Hata, H', 'Nishimura, H', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Shirono K', 'Hattori T', 'Hata H', 'Nishimura H', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78973-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1664-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This generality is supported by the rarity of convincing reports on acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) with two karyotypically independent clones. Relying on sequential cytogenetic analyses, we identified such clones in two children with relapsed AML. The first case, classified as M2 leukemia in the French-American-British (FAB) classification system, had a t(8;21) (q22;q22) at diagnosis; 16 months later, at relapse, the leukemic cells had uniform morphologic features similar to those observed at diagnosis, except that two independent clones were present: one with the original t(8;21) and the other with t(11;22)(q23;q13) [corrected]). The second case was initially classified as FAB M1 leukemia with a t(8;21) (q22;q22). At relapse, 16 months later, the blast cells appeared morphologically uniform and similar to the diagnostic specimen; however, in addition to the original t(8;21) clone, there was a t(1;11) (p32;q23) [corrected]. These findings suggest that separate leukemogenic events affecting different progenitor cells can occur in rare cases of AML. The presence of two karyotypically independent clones could also be explained by multistep leukemogenesis; that is, more than one cell from a common pool of preleukemic cells could be affected by the transforming event, resulting in two independent clones. Alternatively, in light of recent reports of therapy-related leukemias with an 11q23 translocation, the new independent clone in these two patients could represent a therapy-related secondary malignancy. Thus, 11q23 translocations may occur preferentially in stem cells that are more susceptible to treatment-induced malignant transformation.","['Hayashi, Y', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Santana, V M', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Pui, C H', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Williams, D L']","['Hayashi Y', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Santana VM', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Pui CH', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Williams DL']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78971-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1650-5.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Blood 1989 Aug 15;74(3):1180'],,,,,,,

All rat IgM and IgG antibodies of this specificity are lytic with human complement, but only IgG2b is active in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We compared the ability of IgM, IgG2a, and IgG2b to deplete lymphocytes in vivo in two patients with prolymphocytic transformation of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The IgM (CAMPATH-1M) produced transient depletion of blood lymphocytes with consumption of complement but had no effect on solid masses or bone marrow. Similar transient depletion of blood lymphocytes was noted with the IgG2a (YTH34.5). In contrast, the IgG2b (CAMPATH-1G) produced long-lasting depletion of lymphocytes from blood and marrow and improvement in splenomegaly but no detectable changes in complement levels. These differences probably reflect the importance of Fc receptor binding for effective clearance of target cells in vivo. We treated 16 more patients with a variety of lymphoid malignancies and noted consistent effects on blood lymphocytes, marrow infiltration, and splenomegaly. At this dose level, there was comparatively little improvement in affected lymph nodes or extranodal masses. Nevertheless, the in vivo lympholytic ability of CAMPATH-1G is very potent as compared with other monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and may have applications in therapy of lymphoid malignancies and as an immunosuppressive agent.","['Dyer, M J', 'Hale, G', 'Hayhoe, F G', 'Waldmann, H']","['Dyer MJ', 'Hale G', 'Hayhoe FG', 'Waldmann H']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, England.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin M/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Time Factors']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78941-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1431-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we have focused on previously untreated, early stage patients who are less than 60 years of age. All patients had less than 50,000 lymphocytes/microL and immunologic analysis revealed a CD20+, IgM+, IgD- phenotype for leukemic B cells in eight of nine patients. Recombinant interferon alpha 2b (IFN-alpha 2) at 5 x 10(6) U was given subcutaneously three times per week for 8 to 16 months. Consistent with earlier reports, side effects were minor with this low-dose protocol. All patients responded with a decrease of WBC count and lymphocyte count; in one patient, splenomegaly resolved such that he moved from Rai stage II to Rai stage I. On the average CD20+ B cells decreased from 14,312 to 3,995 cells/microL, indicating that no complete eradication of the leukemic cells was possible. A partial response, based on a greater than 50% reduction of CD20+ B cells was obtained in five of seven patients analyzed. The increased numbers of CD2+ T lymphocytes decreased in response to interferon treatment in six of seven patients. Furthermore, in a portion of the patients class II antigen expression was enhanced on LeuM3+ monocytes suggesting an in vivo activation of the monocytes by IFN-alpha 2. Immunoglobulin levels were substantially improved in that serum IgG increased by more than 3 g/L in three of seven patients. In one patient, lymphocyte counts increased in spite of continued therapy, whereas all others exhibited no increase of lymphocyte numbers while on therapy. Our study clearly demonstrates effects of IFN-alpha 2 treatment on both the leukemic cells and on the nonleukemic components of the immune system in peripheral blood. Whether IFN-alpha treatment will result in long-term beneficial effects in early stage CLL needs to be evaluated in a larger study.","['Ziegler-Heitbrock, H W', 'Schlag, R', 'Flieger, D', 'Thiel, E']","['Ziegler-Heitbrock HW', 'Schlag R', 'Flieger D', 'Thiel E']","['Institute for Immunology, University of Munich, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'HLA-D Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/analysis', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78940-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 1;73(6):1426-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,

An immunogenic Ehrlich cell line (E1.15) induced an immunologically based growth inhibition of the two other Ehrlich cell lines (E1.80 and E1.95) which themselves were non-immunogenic. E1.15 was, however, unable to induce an immunological response against the P388 cell line. It is therefore suggested that when in close contact, immunologically induced cellular responses imposed by an immunogenic cell line on other cell lines require genetic and thereby close immunogenic resemblance between the cell lines. Another type of interaction was found between the E1.95 cell line and the P388 line which showed nearly identical growth characteristics as determined by tumor weight day 14, tumor growth curves, cell cycle times (per cent labelled mitoses) and cell cycle distributions (flow cytometric DNA analysis). After 2 weeks of growth of mixed P388/E1.95 tumors, flow cytometric DNA analysis on fine-needle tumor aspirates showed nearly total dominance of P388. This type of interaction required close cellular contact of viable cells, and no cellular immune response was elicited by the host animals. A third finding was that a faster growing Ehrlich cell line E1.95 dominated the tumors when inoculated in mixture with a slower growing subpopulation E1.80.

We reviewed the results of OLB in 41 patients with previously diagnosed Hodgkin's disease (17 with stage II disease, 10 with stage III, and 14 with stage IV) who had pulmonary opacification on chest roentgenogram. Nineteen (46%) diagnoses were specific and 22 nonspecific. The most common specific diagnosis was Hodgkin's disease (12 patients); the others were Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), solitary fungal granuloma (2), cytomegalovirus pneumonia (1), and primary lung adenocarcinoma (1). Specific diagnoses were made in 11 (69%) of 16 patients with discrete nodules or masses but in only eight (32%) of the 25 patients with non-nodular radiographic opacification. Eleven (58%) of 19 patients who were asymptomatic or had had symptoms for longer than 4 wk had specific diagnoses, compared to one of six patients (17%) symptomatic for 1 wk or less. Survival of hospitalization correlated more with stage of Hodgkin's disease than with specific diagnosis. However, treatment was changed after biopsy in 22 (54%) of the patients. The results suggest that OLB can be helpful in the management of patients with Hodgkin's disease and pulmonary infiltrates, both in establishing a diagnosis and in assisting the patients' management. OLB appears to be more helpful in patients with Hodgkin's disease than in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pulmonary infiltrates.","['Catterall, J R', 'McCabe, R E', 'Brooks, R G', 'Remington, J S']","['Catterall JR', 'McCabe RE', 'Brooks RG', 'Remington JS']","['Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, CA 94301.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am Rev Respir Dis,The American review of respiratory disease,0370523,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/secondary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Radiography']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1164/ajrccm/139.5.1274 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Rev Respir Dis. 1989 May;139(5):1274-9. doi: 10.1164/ajrccm/139.5.1274.,['AI-06723/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that interferon-alpha can control severe refractory thrombocytosis in patients with advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia. Therefore, we treated a group of thrombocythemic patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders, including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha 2a). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with profound elevations in platelet counts received a median induction dose of 5.4 X 10(6) U/day (range, 5.0 to 10.0 X 10(6) U/day) of rIFN-alpha 2a administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. RESULTS: We observed a significant decline in platelet counts from a median baseline value of 1,929 X 10(9)/L (range, 960 to 2,960 X 10(9)/L) to a median posttreatment value of 431 X 10(9)/L (range, 71 to 1,150 X 10(9)/L) (p less than 0.01). Concomitantly, white blood cell counts declined from a median baseline value of 20.8 X 10(9)/L (range, 10.5 to 40.8 X 10(9)/L) to a median posttreatment value of 6.1 X 10(9)/L (range, 2.9 to 29.0 X 10(9)/L) (p less than 0.02). Correction of thrombocytosis was rapid, with a median of only eight days from the start of therapy to the achievement of a platelet count less than 1,000 X 10(9)/L. Six of eight patients have shown an ongoing response with a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, one to 30 months). There have been no bleeding or thrombotic events during the study. Side effects of rIFN-alpha 2a therapy consisted of fever and flu-like symptoms, with tachyphylaxis developing after one to two weeks of therapy. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that alpha interferon may be a promising therapeutic agent for myeloproliferative disorders characterized by thrombocytosis.","['Talpaz, M', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Gutterman, J U']","['Talpaz M', 'Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Gutterman JU']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(89)90384-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(89)90384-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 May;86(5):554-8. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90384-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to examine the Bournemouth system in a series of 370 patients with MDS and to evaluate the capability of the prognostic index recently proposed by our group to better define the outcome predicted by the former. The Bournemouth scoring system identified 3 risk groups, A (0-1 points), B (2-3 points) and C (4 points), in the whole series (p less than 0.0001) and it allowed us to stratify refractory anemia (RA), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) patients into two distinct prognostic groups (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). This scoring system did not show a significant value in RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients (p greater than 0.05).

A single IRE mediates iron-dependent control of ferritin translation, whereas multiple IREs are found in the region of the transferrin receptor mRNA responsible for iron-dependent control of mRNA stability. A cytosolic protein binds in vitro to the IREs of both mRNAs. The IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) is shown to require free sulfhydryl groups for its specific interaction with the IRE. Treatment of lysates with reducing agents increases the binding activity, whereas agents that block sulfhydryls inhibit binding. Iron starvation, leading to decreased ferritin translation, results in increased binding activity, which is explained by an increase in the fraction of the IRE-BP that is in a fully reduced state.","['Hentze, M W', 'Rouault, T A', 'Harford, J B', 'Klausner, R D']","['Hentze MW', 'Rouault TA', 'Harford JB', 'Klausner RD']","['Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Ferritins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/04/21 00:00,1989/04/21 00:01,['1989/04/21 00:00'],"['1989/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2711187 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1989 Apr 21;244(4902):357-9. doi: 10.1126/science.2711187.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The minimum follow-up was 2 years (median, 11 years). The staging distribution was IA-B, 61; IIA, 54; IIB, 20; IIIA, 46; and IIIB, 19. Sixty-one percent of the patients had laparotomy. Initial management was irradiation alone (RA) in 143 patients and a combination of chemotherapy and irradiation (CB) in 57 patients. Actuarial 10-year survival rates were 82%, IA-B; 78%, IIA; 66%, IIB; 66%, IIIA; and 24%, IIIB. Cause-specific deaths due to Hodgkin's disease or complications of initial or salvage therapy occurred in 3% of IA-B patients, 18% of IIA-B patients, and 35% of IIIA-B patients. One patient had a prior T3N1 squamous cell carcinoma of the retromolar trigone, and a second was diagnosed with concurrent Hodgkin's disease and granulocytic sarcoma. Subsequent solid tumors have occurred in six patients from 5 to 21 years after treatment, including papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, renal cell carcinoma, unilateral breast carcinoma, cervix carcinoma in situ, and lung carcinoma after RA, and bilateral breast carcinoma after CB. Seven fatal hematopoietic disorders (HPDs) were observed, including four acute leukemias, one dysmyeloproliferative syndrome (DMPS), one autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and one aplastic anemia. Two occurred in patients initially managed with RA who subsequently required chemotherapy for relapse. Five HPDs occurred in patients initially managed with CB who never relapsed. All HPDs were observed between 2 and 7.5 years after administration of chemotherapy. Statistical analysis of the data using a rerandomization test on Gehan ranks of treatment and clinical variables showed significant correlations between development of a secondary HPD and (1) initial management with CB; (2) higher doses of chemotherapy; and (3) more advanced disease, particularly IIIB. When only the five events generally associated with treatment (i.e. the four leukemias and one DMPS) were considered, there was a significant correlation with exposure to chemotherapy and presentation with advanced disease. The patient population was small so that interdependence between treatment factors and initial extent of disease in affecting the risk of a secondary HPD cannot be discounted but should be further investigated with larger patient populations.","['Mendenhall, N P', 'Shuster, J J', 'Million, R R']","['Mendenhall NP', 'Shuster JJ', 'Million RR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville 32610-0385.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/*etiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-8140(89)90170-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-8140(89)90170-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1989 Mar;14(3):219-29. doi: 10.1016/0167-8140(89)90170-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the subcellular localization of CLC protein in human basophils from peripheral blood using an ultrastructural postembedding immunogold method and affinity chromatography-purified polyclonal primary antibody to purified human eosinophil CLC protein. We found CLC protein to be uniquely associated with the main, large, particle-filled granule population of human basophils and particularly within intragranular Charcot-Leyden crystals in these granules. Rarely, CLC protein was localized within small, smooth perigranular vesicles. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes present in preparations stained for the CLC protein were negative as were controls for the specificity of the immunogold staining. Mature eosinophils contained small numbers of positive crystalloid-free primary granules, as previously reported (Dvorak AM, Letourneau L, Login GR, Weler PF, Ackerman SJ, Blood 72:150, 1988). The presence of CLC protein in hexagonal and pyramidal crystals regularly present in activated types II and III basophils suggests two possibilities currently being investigated. Like eosinophils, basophils could synthesize CLC protein, or eosinophil-derived CLC protein could be internalized and stored in basophil granules. Regardless of the mechanism for acquisition of CLC protein (lysophospholipase) by basophils, the identification and subcellular localization of this enzyme in basophils requires that it be considered in basophil cell biology as well as in the pathobiology of basophil-rich reactions.","['Dvorak, A M', 'Ackerman, S J']","['Dvorak AM', 'Ackerman SJ']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (Lysophospholipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (lysolecithin acylhydrolase)']",IM,"['Basophils/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Crystallization', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Glycoproteins/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/pathology', 'Lysophospholipase/*analysis', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phospholipases/*analysis']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1989 Apr;60(4):557-67.,"['AI 22660/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 25230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Because resistance to flow (R) through a catheter of lumen radius, r, is proportional to 1/r4, we hypothesized that measurement of R would provide an objective and sensitive monitor for partial occlusions. Our measurements showed that median R at a flow of 17 mL/min was 0.7 cmH2O/mL/min in normally functioning Hickman catheters, and 4.1 cmH2O/mL/min in Broviac catheters. In obstructed catheters, which by subjective standards resisted flushing or blood withdrawal, median R was 3.0 cmH2O/mL/min for Hickman and 5.6 cmH2O/mL/min for Broviac catheters, representing significant increases. In a series of obstructed lines in which urokinase was administered, R decreased from 7.7 to 4.5 in Hickman catheters and from 5.6 to 4.2 in obstructed Broviac catheters. The elevated resistance in Hickman catheters after urokinase suggested that residual catheter obstruction was present even though catheter function returned to normal. Elevated R was seen with abnormal venograms in seven of 13 patients. Four patients had normal R values and abnormal venograms, and two patients had elevated R values with normal venograms. Measurement of resistance in Hickman and Broviac catheters provides a simple technique that can supplement or replace venography in the serial assessment and treatment of partial obstruction.","['Stokes, D C', 'Rao, B N', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Mackert, P W', 'Austin, B', 'Colten, M', 'Hancock, M L']","['Stokes DC', 'Rao BN', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Mackert PW', 'Austin B', 'Colten M', 'Hancock ML']","[""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,['EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*instrumentation', '*Catheters, Indwelling', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial/instrumentation', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Thrombosis/*drug therapy', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*administration & dosage', 'Vena Cava, Superior']",1989/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346889001624 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(89)80007-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1989 Mar;24(3):257-62. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(89)80007-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, there were 2874 observed compared with 3568 expected deaths (standardized mortality ratio, 77). Mortality rates for most major cause of death categories and most cancers were also lower than expected. However, there was a statistically significant 50% excess of leukemia deaths (44 observed/29.6 expected). Lymphocytic leukemia was increased both among men hired before 1940 and among men hired in 1940 or later. In contrast, myelocytic leukemia was increased only among men hired in 1940 or later. The restriction of the myelocytic leukemia excess to men hired in 1940 or later may be related to process changes which occurred at the refinery after 1940 and which resulted in an increased percentage of benzene in certain refinery streams. The presence of an excess of lymphocytic leukemia, but not myelocytic leukemia, among men hired before 1940 suggests that some factor other than benzene was responsible for the former condition.","['Wongsrichanalai, C', 'Delzell, E', 'Cole, P']","['Wongsrichanalai C', 'Delzell E', 'Cole P']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama, Birmingham School of Public Health 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Occup Med,Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,7502807,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'United States']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Occup Med. 1989 Feb;31(2):106-11.,['CA29968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate this possibility, patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in relapse were treated with two sequential schedules of serially increasing ara-C dose rates over a total of 36 hours. Schedule I consisted of serial infusions of 250, 500, and 750 mg/m2 each over 12 hours. Subsequently, patients entered on schedule II received 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg/m2 serially, each over 12 hours. Steady-state levels of ara-CTP were achieved within four hours after beginning ara-C infusion and, in separate studies of a single ara-C dose rate, were shown to be maintained beyond 36 hours. Four patients treated with schedule I and two patients treated with schedule II showed a linear dose rate-dependent increase-of ara-CTPss at all three dose rates. The cells of one patient on schedule I and two patients on schedule II had a dose rate-dependent ara-CTPss increase only over the first two dose levels, while no increase or lower ara-CTPss was observed at the third dose rate. The ara-CTPss of one patient on schedule II did not change. These results suggest that there is a proportionality between the continuous infusion dose rate of ara-C and the ara-CTPss in circulating leukemia cells within the dose range of 250 to 1,000 mg/m2 over 12 hours. This opens the possibility that pharmacologic determinations may be used to redirect the ara-C dose rate to achieve a desired ara-CTPss level in leukemia blasts during therapy.","['Heinemann, V', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Heinemann V', 'Estey E', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/blood', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.5.622 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 May;7(5):622-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.5.622.,['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Ten of the 11 patients (91%) with severe hypercalcemia showed inverted, biphasic, and notched T waves, mainly in the chest leads. Notched T waves were observed in all 10 of these patients in anterior to lateral, mid to lateral, or lateral chest leads. Biphasic and/or inverted T waves in anterior or anterior to midchest leads were present in 4 of these 10 patients who had extreme hypercalcemia (greater than 16 mg/dl).

Decrease in T wave amplitude was marked in severe hypercalcemia (p less than 0.0001) and moderate hypercalcemia, but there was no change in mild hypercalcemia. Changes in T wave morphology, polarity, and amplitude either appeared with development of hypercalcemia or disappeared with normalization of serum calcium level.

The average cytosolic [Ca2+] in various leukocyte populations was measured in Fura 2-loaded cell suspensions while the cytosolic [Ca2+] in individual, Indo 1-loaded leukocytes was assayed by flow cytometric methods. Utilizing normal blood- and marrow-derived cells, human leukemic cell lines, and mononuclear cell fractions derived from the blood of patients with various leukemias, we have found that ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization appears restricted to leukocytes of neutrophil/monocyte ontogeny. Significant ATP-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] were observed in neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid progenitor cells as immature as myeloblasts, but not in lymphocytes. Extensive characterization of the ATP-induced changes in [Ca2+] observed in the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line have indicated these Ca2+-mobilizing effects of ATP can be correlated with an activation of inositol phospholipid breakdown via the occupation of P2-purinergic receptors Significantly, of the various agonists (FMLP, platelet-activating factor, LTB4, and ATP) which elicit equivalent and maximal Ca2+ mobilization in mature neutrophils and monocytes, ATP was the most efficacious stimulant of Ca2+ mobilization in immature neutrophil/monocyte precursors. Thus, expression of putative P2-purinergic receptors for ATP appears to precede expression of other receptor types known to activate the inositol phospholipid signaling cascades in terminally differentiated phagocytes.","['Cowen, D S', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Shurin, S B', 'Stoll, S E', 'Dubyak, G R']","['Cowen DS', 'Lazarus HM', 'Shurin SB', 'Stoll SE', 'Dubyak GR']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Phagocytes/*metabolism']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114064 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 May;83(5):1651-60. doi: 10.1172/JCI114064.,"['GM-36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC303873,,,,,,,,,

Unambiguous identification of mouse ferritin subunits and in vitro formation of the ferritin shells.,7498-504,"Ferritin H and L subunits present cell-specific features of structure, function, and transcriptional regulation. Mouse Friend erythroleukemia cells offer an interesting model to analyze the erythroid-specific expression of ferritin genes for comparison with the liver, an iron-storing tissue. cDNA clones for mouse ferritin H and L subunits have been isolated and sequenced. The two subunits have very similar calculated masses, 20.9 and 20.6 kDa for H and L, respectively. Electrophoretic analysis of the subunits encoded by the cDNA 1) allows unambiguous identification of mouse ferritin subunits; 2) clearly shows that mouse H and L chains can make heteropolymers in vitro; and 3) demonstrates that, at least in vitro, free subunits can coexist with subunits polymerized into complete shells. The mouse ferritin gene family displays a variable degree of complexity, ranging from three homologous sequences for the H genes to 10-14 homologous loci for the L genes. Transcription of ferritin genes exhibits tissue-specific difference. Nuclear transcriptional run-off experiments show that the L gene is more actively transcribed in the liver than in Friend erythroleukemia cells at different stages of maturation. The accumulation of the H subunit mRNA which results from dimethyl sulfoxide induction of Friend cells is the consequence of an increase in the transcription rate of the H gene. However, the H gene mRNA is transcribed at a similar rate in the liver and in induced Friend cells although 5-fold more mRNA accumulates in these cells. Therefore, there is a tissue-specific regulation of mouse ferritin expression at both the transcription and mRNA stability levels.","['Beaumont, C', 'Dugast, I', 'Renaudie, F', 'Souroujon, M', 'Grandchamp, B']","['Beaumont C', 'Dugast I', 'Renaudie F', 'Souroujon M', 'Grandchamp B']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire, Faculte Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Ferritins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Liver/*physiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/05 00:00,1989/05/05 00:01,['1989/05/05 00:00'],"['1989/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)83262-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 May 5;264(13):7498-504.,['AM 17775/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/J04716', 'GENBANK/M24509']",,,,,

The activity was analyzed as the capacity to induce differentiation in the human basophilic cell line KU812. The KU812 cells responded primarily to cultured media with histamine production and secondarily with granulation. Eight atopic individuals, 3 of whom having mild symptoms, with known birch allergies were selected together with 3 control individuals. Total and specific IgE were analyzed in sera, and basophil and eosinophil counts were determined from blood smears after Wright's staining. Significant differences between the symptomatic atopic individuals and the control group were obtained for eosinophil counts (p less than 0.05) and in the KU812 basophilic differentiation activity assay (p less than 0.01). No single test could significantly discriminate between symptomatic and nonsymptomatic individuals, but the KU812 cell assay in combination with the eosinophil count clearly distinguished the symptomatic individuals from the control group. Increased levels of IgE specific to birch allergen were only obtained in the atopic individuals (p less than 0.001). No difference in basophilic propagating activity was observed with supernatants from cells incubated with birch pollen allergen. Serum tested for basophilic propagating activity showed no or decreased values of inducing histamine production in the KU812 cell line.

The age-adjusted incidence rates for malignant lymphoma among the Hawaii-Japanese were similar to rates for U.S. whites. However, higher rates for follicular centre cell (FCC) lymphoma with a follicular pattern were observed in the Hawaii-Japanese population when compared with rates for native Japanese. On the basis of the cytologic types of the Lukes-Collins classification, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas among the Hawaii-Japanese resembled those of Western countries, rather than those of Japan. B-cell lymphomas predominated (72 per cent), while T-cell types comprised 23 per cent of cases. Follicular centre cell types were encountered most often (59 per cent), and the small cleaved FCC subtype was the most common (30 per cent). The high degree of follicularity (29 per cent) was at variance with the consistently low rates reported in Japan. This may be explained, in part, by higher rates of nodal lymphomas among the Hawaii-Japanese. Of the T-cell lymphomas, diffuse large cell types (T-cell immunoblastic sarcoma, T-IBS), often with cytologic pleomorphism, were relatively frequently encountered (16 per cent), and comprised 15 per cent of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; this observation necessitates special clinical and epidemiologic consideration in view of the large Japanese migration to Hawaii from HTLV-I endemic regions of southern Japan. No registered cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or of Hodgkin's disease were documented in Hawaii-Japanese subjects under the age of 15 years. The age-adjusted incidence rates for Hodgkin's disease among the Hawaii-Japanese were similar with those of native Japanese. Nodular sclerosis was the most frequent histologic subtype. The difficulty in distinguishing between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly when immunologic cell surface markers are not available, is addressed. Low rates for chronic lymphocytic leukemia among the Hawaii-Japanese were confirmed. Not one well-documented case was identified in the 11-year period surveyed.","['Yanagihara, E T', 'Blaisdell, R K', 'Hayashi, T', 'Lukes, R J']","['Yanagihara ET', 'Blaisdell RK', 'Hayashi T', 'Lukes RJ']","['Department of Pathology, Kuakini Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii 96817.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hawaii', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Japan/ethnology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transients and Migrants']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900070305 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1989 May-Jun;7(3):219-32. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900070305.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in these species during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation to a macrophage-like phenotype were quantitated by isotopic labeling techniques. The slow, autonomous breakdown of inositol lipids detectable in uninduced cells was almost completely abolished between 3 and 6 h of PMA addition. The intracellular levels of the inositol phosphates were detectably reduced 1 h after PMA addition and continued to decline during the next 24 h. Also consistent with the reduced breakdown of inositol lipids, the molar ratio of these species showed a small but significant increase relative to other membrane lipids 24 h following PMA addition. However, the cellular DAG content increased gradually after PMA addition, presumably due to the cessation of cell proliferation and reduced utilization of DAG as a precursor for lipid synthesis. The results here suggest that the slow, autonomous generation of inositol lipid-derived second messengers may contribute to the stimulation of proliferation of HL60 cells and that the rapid PMA-induced inhibition of this pathway may precede the triggering of cellular differentiation in this system.","['Porfiri, E', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Porfiri E', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerophosphates)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Glycerophosphates/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol/*metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 May;17(4):344-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditional protection of Fv-2ss cells by admixture with Fv-2rr cells.,330-4,"Fv-2ss marrow cells are protected in vivo from Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia by admixture with a preponderance of Fv-2rr marrow cells. This was demonstrated both in allophenic (mosaic) mice and in bone marrow chimeras constructed from C57BL/6 strains differing at Fv-2 and an enzyme marker (glucose phosphate isomerase). The bone marrow chimeras were constructed by injection of marrow cells from Fv-2ss mice into unirradiated Fv-2rr mice. Bone marrow chimeras derived from this procedure produced 1%-2% donor (Fv-2ss) erythrocytes; this level of chimerism was maintained indefinitely. All the bone marrow chimeras as well as allophenic mice with less than 20% Fv-2ss red cells failed to develop any of the symptoms of Friend disease after infection with the polycythemic strain of Friend virus. The Fv-2rr-mediated protection of Fv-2ss marrow cells could be reversed by pretreatment of the two types of chimeras with either monoclonal or polyclonal antithymocyte antisera. Chimeras treated with either reagent and infected with Friend virus developed symptoms of Friend disease and experienced a shift in their erythrocyte mosaic composition favoring cells of the susceptible genotype. These results are consistent with the notion that a functioning immune system plays a role in the Fv-2rr-mediated protection of Fv-2ss Friend virus target cells. Furthermore, these studies establish conditions whereby a small population of sensitive strain cells in an overwhelming background of resistant strain cells can be selectively expanded. Such conditions could be useful in efforts to clone the Fv-2 gene.","['Behringer, R R', 'Dewey, M J']","['Behringer RR', 'Dewey MJ']","['Department of Biology, University of South Carolina, Columbia 29208.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Chimera', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*genetics', 'Mosaicism', 'Polycythemia/etiology/genetics', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/genetics']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 May;17(4):330-4.,['CA43174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The median duration of survival of the patients in complete remission was 18-24 months (n = 79) compared with 1-2 months for patients in partial or no remission (n = 100). As maintenance chemotherapy, thioguanine, cytarabine and daunorubicin were given for one year. In the ALL group 50 of 51 patients received remission-induction therapy with vincristine, prednisone and Adriablastin, resulting in complete remission in 39 of the patients.

A fluorescence-activated flow cytometer (FCM) was modified with a flow-through cuvette to allow continuous on-line monitoring of daunorubicin uptake in vitro. The addition of Cy-A to multidrug-resistant P388/R cells at steady-state daunorubicin uptake, led to a dose-dependent increase in cellular daunorubicin accumulation, as measured by FCM and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A linear relationship was found between the daunorubicin concentration in the incubation medium and the Cy-A concentration required for optimal stimulation of cellular anthracycline accumulation. The results of a cytotoxicity assay indicated that Cy-A completely restored the chemosensitivity of the P388/R cells. Intracellular Cy-A measurements in P388/S and P388/R cells showed that P388/R cells accumulated significantly less Cy-A than P388/S cells. Relatively high daunorubicin concentrations could not restore that accumulation defect. These results suggest that Cy-A promotes cellular anthracycline accumulation by competing for an outward drug-transport system that operates in multidrug-resistant cells.","['Nooter, K', 'Oostrum, R', 'Jonker, R', 'van Dekken, H', 'Stokdijk, W', 'van den Engh, G']","['Nooter K', 'Oostrum R', 'Jonker R', 'van Dekken H', 'Stokdijk W', 'van den Engh G']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclosporins/analysis/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/analysis/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00292407 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;23(5):296-300. doi: 10.1007/BF00292407.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Influx proceeds by a mechanism that exhibits a Km of 66.7 microM and a Vmax of 0.077 nmol/min per mg cellular protein. The process is somewhat sensitive to metabolic inhibitors, particularly uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, and is significantly affected by the presence of other pteridines in the extracellular medium. The results suggest that pterins with either no 6-substituent (pterin) or those with methyl, hydroxyl, or formyl groups in this position, which exhibit Ki values between 25 and 77 microM, may share the same pathway for uptake. 6-Carboxypterin exhibits low affinity for the system (Ki greater than 500 microM), as do 7-substituted and 6,7-di-substituted derivatives and compounds with larger groups at the 6-position, such as neopterin and biopterin (Ki = 250-300 microM). Efflux of [3H]6-hydroxymethylpterin occurs rapidly and can proceed by at least two routes. The first, comprising approximately 50% of total efflux, is inhibited by extracellular pterins and exhibits similar properties to the uptake system in both its pattern of sensitivity to metabolic inhibitors and its specificity for pteridine structure. The route by which the remaining efflux occurs is relatively insensitive to metabolic inhibition. Adenine significantly inhibits 6-hydroxymethylpterin influx and efflux (Ki = 10.6 microM for uptake) but does not appear to share the same transport system. Similarly, methotrexate and folic acid exhibit little affinity for the unconjugated pteridine transport routes.","['Webber, S', 'Nazarbaghi, R']","['Webber S', 'Nazarbaghi R']","['Department of Basic and Clinical Research, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Pterins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '712-30-1 (2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-formylpteridine)', '7O0I7Z5A0Y (6-hydroxymethylpterin)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Pteridines/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Pterins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00292405 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;23(5):283-90. doi: 10.1007/BF00292405.,['CA 38849/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;25(4):308-9.

Over a 7-month period folic acid concentrations were gradually lowered from 2 microM to 2 nM without subsequent changes in the transport-defective phenotype. In these cells we observed the up regulation of a membrane-associated folate-binding protein with high affinities for folic acid and reduced folates, but poor affinities for the folate antagonists MTX and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin. The binding capacity for [3H]folic acid was 12.5 pmol/10(7) cells, but could be further increased to 30 pmol/10(7) cells following cell transfer to completely folate-deficient medium for 3 days, except that in the latter situation cell growth stopped. The affinities of the folate-binding protein for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, folinic acid, and MTX were 0.33, 0.11, and 0.009, respectively, relative to that of folic acid. Growth of CEM/MTX cells was promoted by nanomolar concentrations of either folic acid (median effective concentration, 0.35 nM) or folinic acid (median effective concentration, 0.75 nM), suggesting that the folate-binding protein is not only involved in folate binding, but also in the uptake of folates. The insensitivity of CEM/MTX cells to MTX was correlated with the poor affinity of the folate-binding protein for MTX, compared to folic acid. MTX was only growth inhibitory when added at concentrations at least 30-fold exceeding those of folic acid in the culture medium. On the other hand, CEM/MTX cells grown at 2 microM or 2 nM folic acid were equally sensitive to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate. Despite the low affinity for MTX, the folate-binding protein could be specifically labeled by an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]MTX and appeared to have a molecular weight of 44,000 as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These data suggest that an alternative folate uptake system, a folate-binding protein, car play an important role in transport-related methotrexate resistance. Moreover, since all these effects were observed for CEM/MTX cells grown at folate levels in the physiological range, it is conceivable that this mechanism of methotrexate resistance can also be of significance in leukemic cells in vivo.","['Jansen, G', 'Westerhof, G R', 'Kathmann, I', 'Rademaker, B C', 'Rijksen, G', 'Schornagel, J H']","['Jansen G', 'Westerhof GR', 'Kathmann I', 'Rademaker BC', 'Rijksen G', 'Schornagel JH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 May 1;49(9):2455-9.,,,,,['Cancer Res 1995 Sep 15;55(18):4203'],,,,,,,

The anticancer activity of procarbazine results from bioactivation to reactive intermediates. It is first oxidized to azoprocarbazine and further N-oxidized to a mixture of methylazoxyprocarbazine and benzylazoxyprocarbazine isomers. In this study the azoxyprocarbazine isomers were synthesized and purified. The cytotoxic effect of the metabolites on the L1210 murine leukemia cell line were then evaluated in vitro by use of a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide. The results of this study showed that the methylazoxyprocarbazine isomer was the most cytotoxic metabolite (IC50, 0.2 mM). The benzylazoxy isomer had an insignificant cytotoxic effect, and a mixture of the two isomers was intermediate in effectiveness. This assay, however, could not be used to determine the cytotoxicity of procarbazine since the drug itself (not the live cells) reduced the dye. A soft-agar clonogenic assay demonstrated that procarbazine was cytotoxic only at higher concentrations (IC50, 1.5 mM) than methylazoxyprocarbazine (IC50, 0.15 mM).

Leukemic cells were isolated from 10 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, immunocytoma and prolymphocytic leukemia. Normal mononuclear cells were collected from 3 healthy subjects. The cells were incubated with [3H]-vincristine and cellular drug accumulation was determined. The accumulation of vincristine differed nine-fold between patients. The presence of verapamil, 6.6 microM, during the incubation, increased drug accumulation by 150-550%. The effect increased with increasing verapamil concentrations up to 12-15 microM. The increased accumulation of vincristine caused by verapamil also led to increased in vitro cytotoxicity. However, neither the cellular accumulation of vincristine nor the effect of verapamil on drug accumulation was correlated with the clinical response to vincristine-containing treatment regimens. To study the clinical effect of verapamil on leukemic cell accumulation of vincristine, 4 patients were given verapamil, 120 mg three times orally. The plasma concentrations of verapamil after 3 days of treatment were lower than those required to enhance vincristine accumulation in vitro. In addition, norverapamil could also be detected in all patients. Before and at the end of the verapamil treatment period, blood from the patients was incubated with [3H]-vincristine and the leukemic cells then isolated. Verapamil treatment had no effect on the accumulation of vincristine in leukemic cells.","['Gruber, A', 'Reizenstein, P', 'Peterson, C']","['Gruber A', 'Reizenstein P', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacokinetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jan-Feb;9(1):9-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half-maximal inhibition (IC50 value) was observed at 200 microM. However, preincubation of ADR with phosphatidylserine (PS) or PKC enzyme, prior to the enzyme assay, reduced the IC50 value from 200 microM to 52 microM or 40 microM, respectively, indicating an affinity of ADR for PS, and also a possible action site for ADR on PKC molecules. Preincubation of ADR with diacylglycerol (DAG) before the PKC assay resulted in a more pronounced effect, i.e., a more rapid decline of PKC activity with an IC50 value of 7 microM. However, the IC50 for ADR inhibition was not altered when ATP, histone or Ca++ were preincubated with ADR. Studies of the kinetic nature of the inhibition revealed that ADR inhibition assumes competitive kinetics with respect to DAG. Therefore, the mechanism by which ADR inhibits PKC activity may involve a multi-site action: a primary interaction with DAG, and a secondary lower interaction with membrane PS and PKC apoenzyme.","['Zhao, F K', 'Chuang, L F', 'Israel, M', 'Chuang, R Y']","['Zhao FK', 'Chuang LF', 'Israel M', 'Chuang RY']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jan-Feb;9(1):225-9.,"['CA 33022/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Predictive factors for remission were the duration of preceding remission and the time from last chemotherapy to relapse. Three pts were transplanted in 2nd CR. 1/6 refractory pts reached CR, 2 pts remained refractory, and 3 died during hypoplasia. The median duration of disease-free survival (DFS) of relapsed pts was 3.3 months without further treatment, median survival of responding pts (18 replased pts, 1 refractory pt) was 4.6 months, the overall survival (n = 29) was 4.8 months. Pts receiving BMT were censured at the time of BMT. Seven pts experienced lung toxicity due to ara-C, four of whom died. The incidence of lung toxicity was clearly related to the extent of ara-C pretreatment during intensive maintenance. In conclusion, ID-ara-C/m-AMSA is a very effective reinduction treatment in these pts with acceptable toxicity; the impact of HD-ara-C during consolidation for DFS and survival is questionable.","['Jehn, U', 'Heinemann, V', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Jehn U', 'Heinemann V', 'Wilmanns W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, F.R.G.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1989 Jan-Feb;9(1):119-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Out of 217 such patients, 7 (3.2%) had platelet counts greater than 400,000/mm3. All of the seven were boys compared with a male:female ration of 1.4:1 in the entire ALL population. Other than sex, no characteristics were clearly associated with thrombocytosis, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, lymphoblast morphology, and immunologic or chromosomal markers. Apart from ALL, no inflammatory or infectious process which might have caused a thrombocytosis, was detected in any of these patients. The period of induction therapy was notable for the preservation of platelet counts greater than 20,000/mm3 in all patients. However, of the seven children with thrombocytosis, two had major induction complications: one, a cavernous sinus thrombosis; and the other, gastrointestinal bleeding with duodenal perforation. We conclude that thrombocytosis at diagnosis can be seen in children, particularly boys, with ALL. Based on small numbers, this group of patients may be at risk for major events during induction therapy. Large numbers, longer follow-up, and platelet function studies on similar patients will be of interest.","['Blatt, J', 'Penchansky, L', 'Horn, M']","['Blatt J', 'Penchansky L', 'Horn M']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15213.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*diagnosis']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830310109 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1989 May;31(1):46-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830310109.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the Rai staging and the International Workshop on CLL staging systems were effective in identifying groups of patients with significantly different prognoses (P less than .05). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the combination of three clinicopathologic characteristics (bone marrow histopathologic pattern, absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count, and the presence or not of hypogammaglobulinaemia) had the strongest predictive relationship with survival time.

To assure medical care for the 365,000 AIDS patients projected for the US by 1992, it is imperative to know whether there is something unique about AIDS patients that produces aversion among physicians. We hypothesized that the desire to avoid AIDS patients derived from three fears: fear of contagion, homophobia, and a desire to avoid dying patients. To identify the extent to which these three fears affect the attitudes that students hold toward AIDS patients, we conducted three studies. In our first study, we discovered that students' views about a patient with a terminal illness are the same whether the illness is leukemia or AIDS. In the second study, we found that the patient's sexual preference was not the major reason students would avoid an AIDS patients. In a third study, we confirmed that fear of contagion is the principal cause of students' desire to avoid an AIDS patient. In the course of these studies, we found important differences between the attitudes of male and female students. Female students scored lower on the homophobic scale than male students, and they had less antipathy toward AIDS patients. Helping health care professionals understand their fears toward patients with AIDS will in the long run improve medical care. Since the origins of these fears are for the most part well hidden in our unconscious, dissemination of facts alone will not do the job. Interventions are needed to help health care professionals acknowledge and overcome their negative feelings about AIDS.","['Merrill, J M', 'Laux, L', 'Thornby, J I']","['Merrill JM', 'Laux L', 'Thornby JI']","['Department of Community Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Tex. 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*psychology', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Attitude to Death', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Homosexuality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Male', 'Sex Factors', 'Students/*psychology', 'Students, Medical/*psychology']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007611-198904000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,South Med J. 1989 Apr;82(4):426-32. doi: 10.1097/00007611-198904000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequencing analysis of the joining site of the bcl-2 gene and Ig lambda gene has shown that the breakpoint is within the 5' flanking region of the bcl-2 gene and about 2.2 kilobases 5' to the joining segment of Ig lambda locus in a germ-line configuration. The extranucleotide, commonly appearing at the joining site of the t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH locus, is absent from the joining site of bcl-2 and Ig lambda. The lack of extranucleotide suggests that the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes occurred during physiological rearrangement of the Ig lambda gene since it has been shown that the rearrangement of the Ig lambda locus is not accompanied by extranucleotides.","['Adachi, M', 'Cossman, J', 'Longo, D', 'Croce, C M', 'Tsujimoto, Y']","['Adachi M', 'Cossman J', 'Longo D', 'Croce CM', 'Tsujimoto Y']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.86.8.2771 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Apr;86(8):2771-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.8.2771.,['CA 69805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC287000,,,,"['GENBANK/J04529', 'GENBANK/J04530']",,,,,

We previously reported that the MoMuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) is inactive in undifferentiated F9EC cells due to inactivity of the tandemly repeated MoMuLV transcriptional enhancers. Others suggested that the inactivity was due to the presence of negative regulatory elements that interact with the MoMuLV tandem repeats. Two heterologous enhancer sequences that are active in undifferentiated F9 EC cells were inserted into the MoMuLV LTR: the B enhancers from the F101 variant of polyomavirus and a cellular enhancer sequence isolated from EC cells that we previously identified. The chimeric LTRs were then fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and tested for expression by transfection into F9 EC or NIH 3T3 cells. Insertion of these enhancers either upstream or downstream of the MoMuLV tandem repeats resulted in transcriptionally active LTRs in undifferentiated EC cells, which did not support the existence of negative regulatory elements interacting with the tandem repeats. In our previous MoMuLV enhancer deletion constructs, the GC-rich sequences downstream from the tandem repeats were also deleted, which might have contributed to the inactivity in EC cells. However, restoration of the GC-rich sequences did not yield an active LTR. The experiments also suggested that the EC cellular enhancer was preferentially active in undifferentiated EC cells and inactive in NIH 3T3 cells. The possibility of negative regulatory sequences in the vicinity of the MoMuLV primer-binding site was tested by inserting MoMuLV sequences from +30 to +419 base pairs into the LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene constructs downstream of the transcriptional start site. Transient expression assays confirmed that these sequences reduced expression from functional LTRs in undifferentiated F9 EC cells but reduced expression significantly less in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, equivalent sequences from myeloproliferative sarcoma virus did not exhibit this effect. These results supported restriction of MoMuLV expression in undifferentiated F9 EC cells at two levels, inactivity of the MoMuLV enhancers and interaction of negative regulatory factors in the vicinity of the primer-binding site.","['Feuer, G', 'Taketo, M', 'Hanecak, R C', 'Fan, H']","['Feuer G', 'Taketo M', 'Hanecak RC', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Teratoma/*microbiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.5.2317-2324.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 May;63(5):2317-24. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.5.2317-2324.1989.,"['CA 32454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC250650,,,,,,,,,

AC is one of the most active agents, experimental or clinical, against the Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. AC is the first acridine derivative in our hands to show higher activity against cultured Lewis lung cells than against leukaemia lines. AC is more active against two human leukaemia cell lines (U-937 and Jurkat) than against a melanoma line (MM-96) and is inactive against the HT-29 human colon line. With all cell lines tested, cytotoxicity was higher at AC concentrations of 3-6 microM than at 15-20 microM. AC at a concentration of 20 microM inhibited the cytotoxicity of amsacrine and CI-921, but not that of another topoisomerase-directed drug doxorubicin. A Lewis lung line which had been cultured for a long period was less sensitive than a line freshly isolated from mice, but sensitivity of the cultured line recovered after it was multiply passaged in vivo.

In this study the cytotoxic agent 9-methoxy-ellipticin (MeOE) was incorporated into dimirystoyl phosphatidylcholine, cholesteryl oleate stabilized microemulsion and the latter fused with human LDL. Both agarose electrophoresis migration and the electron microscopic shape of the drug-LDL complexes were similar to those of native LDL. The in vitro cytotoxic tests on L1210 and P388 leukemic cells demonstrated that the complex was able to kill cells and was more effective than the free drug. This cytotoxic activity of the drug-LDL complex depends on the LDL high affinity receptor: the native LDL reduces the killing power. In contrast, methylated LDL, which does not bind to the LDL receptor, has no effect on it. On the other hand, heparin, which prevents binding on the cell surface receptors, partially reduced the cytotoxic activity of the drug-lipoprotein complex. These results suggest that it is possible to incorporate lipophilic cytotoxic drugs into LDL, using a technique of fusion with the microemulsion which contains the drug. This technique allows us to obtain a drug-LDL complex which is able to kill cells via the LDL receptor pathway.","['Samadi-Baboli, M', 'Favre, G', 'Blancy, E', 'Soula, G']","['Samadi-Baboli M', 'Favre G', 'Blancy E', 'Soula G']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', 'U0924292N9 (9-methoxyellipticine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Ellipticines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', '*Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(89)90014-x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1989 Feb;25(2):233-41. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(89)90014-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each plasmid carries the neo gene coding for Geneticin resistance, but in pSV N-ras, the endogenous promoter of the N-ras gene has been eliminated, and the gene has been inserted between the viral long-terminal repeat (LTR) and the neo gene so that transcription initiated from the LTR must transcribe the N-ras gene before transcribing neo. In pNR-MG1, transcription of the N-ras gene is driven from its endogenous promoter, and the neo gene is transcribed from an SV40 viral promoter, as in pSV2neo. When the transfectants were selected for Geneticin resistance, 70% of the colonies formed with pSV N-ras consisted of morphologically altered cells. Less than 5% of the drug resistant colonies formed with pNR-MG1 had cells with altered morphology, and the change in morphology was much less distinct than with pSV N-ras. No colonies of morphologically-transformed cells were found with pSVneo. If the transfected populations were not selected in Geneticin, but were simply allowed to grow to confluence, very distinct foci composed of morphologically-altered cells could be seen against a contact-inhibited monolayer with pSV N-ras. Foci formed by the pNR-MG1 population were subtle and much less distinct. No foci were found with pSV2neo. Representative colonies and foci of morphologically-transformed cells were isolated. Those from pNR-MG1 transfection reverted to a normal morphology after 5-10 population doublings. Most of those from pSV N-ras transfection either reverted or senesced after 5-10 population doublings. However, progeny of two colonies expressed stable morphological transformation throughout a normal life span equal to that of age-matched pSV2neo controls. Both of these stably transformed cell strains exhibited anchorage independence and formed distinct foci. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that these cells produced much larger amounts of N-ras protein than did pSV2neo-transfected control cells. However, these two cell strains did not exhibit an infinite life span in culture and were unable to form tumors in athymic mice.","['Wilson, D M', 'Fry, D G', 'Maher, V M', 'McCormick, J J']","['Wilson DM', 'Fry DG', 'Maher VM', 'McCormick JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1316.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', '*Oncogenes', '*Transfection']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/10.4.635 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1989 Apr;10(4):635-40. doi: 10.1093/carcin/10.4.635.,['CA21289/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

These observations indicate that modifications of the chromophore moiety of the anthracycline may enhance both drug cytotoxicity and specificity of drug-target interactions, and thus provide further strong evidence that the anthracycline effect on DNA integrity is a critical aspect of the mechanism of drug action.","['Capranico, G', 'De Isabella, P', 'Penco, S', 'Tinelli, S', 'Zunino, F']","['Capranico G', 'De Isabella P', 'Penco S', 'Tinelli S', 'Zunino F']","['Division of Experimental Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '84519-42-6 (9-deoxydoxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '96597-11-4 (4-demethyl-6-deoxydoxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Apr 15;49(8):2022-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the mechanisms involved in regulating this event, receptor protein and mRNA levels were measured in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced to differentiate along the myelocytic and monocytic pathways. Transferrin receptor down-regulation which occurs during granulocytic differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, or aclacinomycin A appears to be kinetically compatible with reduced biosynthesis resulting from reductions in the level of steady-state mRNA. In contrast, genetic modulation does not appear to mediate the initial receptor down-regulation seen during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced monocytic differentiation. However, a reduction in levels of receptor message appears to contribute to the maintenance of diminished transferrin receptor activity in these 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated cells. A common feature of myelocytic and monocytic differentiating cells is the complete inhibition of cellular proliferation observed within 10 to 16 h following a four-fold reduction in surface transferrin receptor. We conclude that the early decline in transferrin receptor levels precludes its regulation as a consequence of the decrease in proliferation, but rather implicates its role in the programmed cessation of growth which is requisite for the terminal differentiation of these cells.","['Ho, P T', 'Ishiguro, K', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ho PT', 'Ishiguro K', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Apr 15;49(8):1989-95.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

CC-1065 covalently binds to calf thymus DNA preferentially to adenine-thymine regions at N3 of adenine. Here, we compare CC-1065 interaction with P388-derived chromatin, DNA, and histones as measured by electronic absorption and circular dichroism. Two CC-1065 analogues (U-71,184 and its enantiomer, U-71,185) which show different biological activities from CC-1065 were also studied. The shape and temporal behavior of the induced circular dichroism curves generated by CC-1065 or its analogues bound to chromatin were similar to CC-1065 plus DNA. This suggested that CC-1065 and its analogues bind to the minor groove of chromatin DNA in a manner similar to calf thymus DNA. However, the binding of CC-1065 and its analogues to DNA induced a more intense circular dichroism band than binding to chromatin. The order of interaction for both chromatin and DNA was CC-1065 greater than U-71,184 greater than U-71,185. In contrast to the essentially irreversible binding to DNA after 24-h incubation, binding to chromatin was primarily a reversible interaction, the degree of reversibility being U-71,185 greater than U-71,184 = CC-1065.

Budding C-type particles were present at the cell surface. The principal site of intracisternal particle production was in elements of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum disposed about the periphery of stacks of annulate lamellae. Serial sections demonstrated that these virus-laden cisternae were in direct continuity with the annulate lamellae. In addition, intracisternal particles occurred in membranous honeycomb structures present in the cytoplasm of many cells. Viral elaboration also was associated with stacks of cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum that were devoid of ribosomes, but that were coated with an extensive and continuous layer of dense material. In some instances, the outer nuclear membrane was coated with the same dense substance. It appears that in Friend erythroleukemia cells, a very substantial portion of their cytomembranes is devoted to synthesis of intracisternal particles.","['Walter, R J', 'Tandler, B']","['Walter RJ', 'Tandler B']","['Department of Surgery, Cook County Hospital, Chicago, IL 60612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Italy,J Submicrosc Cytol Pathol,Journal of submicroscopic cytology and pathology,8804312,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/isolation & purification/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Organelles/ultrastructure']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Submicrosc Cytol Pathol. 1989 Jan;21(1):93-101.,"['5 S01 FR05335/PHS HHS/United States', 'BR-00592/BR/FDA HHS/United States', 'GM 00820/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Until their first relapse, patients were initially treated according to standard protocols, whereas the treatment for relapse was heterogeneous. Concerning the probability of achieving a second complete remission (CR) it appears that the duration of the first CR is the single most important prognostic factor. The duration of the first CR is also the most important factor with regard to the duration of the second CR, upon which also age and sex have a significant influence. Concerning the survival from the time of central nervous system (CNS) relapse, again the duration of the first CR appears to be the most important prognostic factor, followed by age and the institution of systemic reinduction treatment. Other factors, such as initial leukocyte count, attainment of first CR within 48 days, type of reinduction treatment, and the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) blast count at the time of relapse, have a less important, but nevertheless significant influence on survival. The median survival from the time of CNS relapse is 25 months, the 5-year survival is 25%, whereas the ultimate survival will be less than 20%. From 90 patients who developed second or subsequent relapses, 75% experienced a bone marrow relapse during the follow-up period. From this study the authors conclude that CNS relapse in children with ALL carries a grave prognosis, which requires the institution of intensive retreatment programs.","['Behrendt, H', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'Schuwirth, C', 'Verkes, R J', 'Hermans, J', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'van Wering, E R']","['Behrendt H', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'Schuwirth C', 'Verkes RJ', 'Hermans J', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'van Wering ER']","['Werkgroep Kindertumoren, Emma Kinderziekenhuis and Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Meningeal Neoplasms/mortality/prevention & control/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/prevention & control/therapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/prevention & control/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19890515)63:10<2066::aid-cncr2820631032>3.0.co;2-i [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 May 15;63(10):2066-72. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890515)63:10<2066::aid-cncr2820631032>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a retrospective review was conducted of 173 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to detect a possible influence of cigarette smoking on initial characteristics at the time of presentation and on the course of this disease. Thirty-nine patients (23%) were smoking 5 cigarettes/d or more at time of diagnosis. Cigarette smoking was significantly related to male sex (P = 0.0005) and younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.02) and smokers tended to have lower leukocyte counts (P = 0.07) than nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with early blast crisis (P less than 0.0001) and short survival (P less than 0.0001). Other characteristics associated with a poor prognosis included hepatomegaly, anemia, and a high percentage of peripheral blast cells at time of diagnosis. When studied in a multivariate analysis, cigarette smoking remained the strongest prognostic factor for both occurrence of blast crisis (P = 0.0003) and overall survival (P = 0.0001). Other poor prognosis factors found in the multivariate analysis included a high percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood at time of diagnosis and high platelet count. It is possible that cigarette smoke may act as a promoter or cocarcinogen in the transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Archimbaud, E', 'Maupas, J', 'Lecluze-Palazzolo, C', 'Fiere, D', 'Viala, J J']","['Archimbaud E', 'Maupas J', 'Lecluze-Palazzolo C', 'Fiere D', 'Viala JJ']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Universite Claude-Bernard, U.E.R.

This study examines the influence which long-term treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha 2 exerts on immune functions in cancer patients. Serial in vitro immune function studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were done to determine parameters of B-cell and T-cell functions as well as natural killer (NK)-cell activity. The authors detected profound suppression of in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation as well as depression of NK-cell activity during IFN treatment. All suppressed immune functions normalized on discontinuation of IFN therapy.

In a prospective study of 26 patients, testicular biopsies were performed after completion of therapy, and the average follow-up after biopsies was 29 months. After immunostaining, seven patients with negative biopsies on routine histology showed scattered, strongly calla-positive cells as well as cells reacting with anti-B (CD22) MoAb. Among these seven patients with residual blast cells, four had relapsed either in testes (n = 1), bone marrow and testes (n = 1), or in the bone marrow (n = 2). In contrast, among the 15 patients without residual blast cells, all but 1 remained in complete remission. In four other cases no definite conclusion was possible after immunohistochemical study. Four testicular biopsies from patients with occult infiltration were used as positive controls. Negative controls consisted of testicular biopsies from children with testicular ectopia and postmortem testicular tissue specimens. Results suggest that the risk of relapse is significantly higher in patients with positive immunohistochemical findings indicating persistent residual blast cells. However, the predictive value of these findings requires confirmation on a larger number of cases to have therapeutic implications.","['Suc, E', 'Robert, A', 'Rubie, H', 'Regnier, C', 'Guitard, J', 'Caveriviere, P', 'al Saati, T', 'Kuhlein, E', 'Chittal, S', 'Delsol, G']","['Suc E', 'Robert A', 'Rubie H', 'Regnier C', 'Guitard J', 'Caveriviere P', 'al Saati T', 'Kuhlein E', 'Chittal S', 'Delsol G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, C.H.U.

We have proposed a multichain model for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor in which both a 55 kDa IL-2-binding peptide identified by the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody and a 70/75 kDa IL-2-binding peptide are associated in a receptor complex. The IL-2 receptor is proving to be an extraordinarily versatile therapeutic target, since it is expressed by the abnormal T cells in patients with certain lymphoid malignancies or autoimmune disorders and in individuals rejecting allografts, whereas it is not expressed by normal resting cells. Specifically, HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukaemia cells constitutively express large numbers of IL-2 Tac receptors. A 42 kDa tax protein encoded predominantly by the pX region of HTLV-I may play a part in directly or indirectly increasing the transcription of the 55 kDa Tac IL-2 receptor gene. To exploit the fact that IL-2 receptors are present on abnormally activated T cells but not on normal resting cells, clinical trials have been initiated involving patients with Tac-expressing haematologic malignancies. These patients are being treated with unmodified anti-Tac, with anti-Tac conjugated to truncated PE toxin, with isotopic (212Bi and 90Y) chelates of anti-Tac and with recombinant 'humanized' anti-Tac.

In more advanced cases the optic disc and the peripapillary retina are covered by a white-yellowish infiltrate which protrudes into the vitreous. The diagnosis is confirmed by CT scan of the orbit and the cerebro-spinal fluid often contains leukemic cells.

These subunits are encoded by different genes and are not expressed coordinately as the cells pass through the cell cycle. Using specific cDNAs for the non-heme iron (NHI) and the effector-binding (EB) subunits the levels of the mRNAs for these two subunits were determined in leukemia L1210 cells during the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Synchronized populations of L1210 cells were obtained either by ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment or by enrichment by elutriation centrifugation. The changes in the levels of the mRNAs for NHI and EB subunits were compared with the changes in the levels of the mRNAs for actin, p53, c-myc, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and DNA content by flow cytometric measurements. Synchronization of the cells by the two methods resulted in quantitative differences in the responses. The EGTA synchronized L1210 cells showed maximal increases of 9.3- and 5.7-fold in the mRNAs for the NHI and EB subunits, respectively. The peak level of the NHI mRNA was observed at 12 hr after the addition of calcium ions. The peak increase in the level of the mRNA for the EB subunit was observed between 12 and 15 hr after the addition of calcium ions.

Natl. Cancer Inst. 67:1025-1030; 1981). We have obtained evidence that induction of the differentiation of these cells by MTX, as well as by other folic acid antagonists, is the result of the effects of these agents on purine and thymine nucleotide biosynthesis. Thymidine (10 microM) completely blocked both the cytotoxicity and induction of differentiation produced by the specific inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB-3717). Thymidine also blocked the acute cytotoxicity caused by MTX and trimetrexate (TMQ); the induction of differentiation and the loss of proliferative capacity, however, were only partially prevented by thymidine. Hypoxanthine (100 microM), which completely restored antifolate-depleted purine nucleotide levels, had no effect on either the cytotoxicity or the induction of maturation produced by these agents. The growth inhibitory effects and the induction of differentiation caused by dideazatetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF), which acts on de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis rather than on DHFR or TS, was completely prevented by hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine also completely prevented the inhibition of cellular replication and induction of differentiation by MTX and TMQ when combined with thymidine. The findings suggest that the depletion of intracellular thymine nucleotide levels by the antifolates, MTX, TMQ, and CB-3717 is the primary event involved in the maturation of HL-60 leukemia cells produced by these agents and that maturation occurs concomitantly with a high level of cytotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Beardsley, G P', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Beardsley GP', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510-8066.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(3):199-207.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation offers a possibility to escalate the dose of cytotoxic therapy, but this possibility is limited by two main factors: need for matched allogeneic donor, and patient age below 45 years. This has led to application of autologous BMT for the treatment of older patients and those without compatible marrow donors. Samples of bone marrow collected before intensive myeloablative treatment are stored by means of cryopreservation. Viability and clonogenicity of stored bone marrow stem cells prior to reinfusion into the patient are tested by in vitro bone marrow culture (usually CFU-GM).

Tiazofurin infusions (daily X 10 to 15) provided remissions in 50% of end-stage leukemic patients. The remissions, of 1 to 10 months' duration, varied from antileukemic effect or hematologic improvement to complete response and complete remission. The total survival of the responding patients was from about 1 to 15 months. 2. Our administration of tiazofurin in a 60-min infusion by pump decreased the incidence and severity of toxicity. 3. It was shown that tiazofurin dose does not need to be escalated at each relapse. Depending on the biochemical and hematological response in this novel protocol, 2,200 to 4,400 mg/m2 tiazofurin appeared to be sufficient to provide remissions. 4. A new role was identified for allopurinol, originally given to decrease uric acid in the plasma. Allopurinol markedly increased plasma hypoxanthine concentrations which competitively inhibited the activity of the salvage enzyme, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, in the blast cells. Thus, the elevated hypoxanthine plasma levels inhibited guanine salvage. To maintain high hypoxanthine levels allopurinol (100 mg) was given every 4 to 6 hr. This provided combination chemotherapy with tiazofurin which inhibited IMP dehydrogenase activity and blocked the de novo biosynthesis of guanylates in the blast cells. 5. Preliminary evidence was obtained in the patients that tiazofurin induced differentiation of the bone marrow. Recent studies also showed that tiazofurin down-regulated the expression of the c-Ki-ras oncogene in K562 erythroleukemic cells. Therefore, tiazofurin treatment provides an impact by chemotherapy, induced differentiation, and, if applicable, through down-regulation of the ras oncogene. 6. Novel aspects of tiazofurin treatment include rational targeting and a continuously monitored trial by measurement of the activity of IMP dehydrogenase and of GTP and TAD concentrations in blast cells and of tiazofurin and hypoxanthine in plasma. 7. Since tiazofurin has not yet achieved lasting remissions in patients nor terminal differentiation of leukemic cells it probably will be advantageous to combine tiazofurin with other drugs to provide synergism. In preclinical tissue culture studies in HL-60 cells synergy was observed with retinoic acid. This may be of interest because retinoic acid also caused differentiation and down-regulation of the myc oncogene.","['Weber, G']",['Weber G'],"['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allopurinol/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/drug effects', 'Guanine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/blood', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribavirin/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uric Acid/blood']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(89)90095-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1989;29:75-95. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(89)90095-2.,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In comparison with the other hematopoietic growth factors, IL-3 preferentially supports the proliferation of early multilineage progenitors or progenitors at early stages of development within the different lineages. Subsequently, the developing cells lose responsiveness to IL-3 while acquiring dependence on the later acting factors: GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, or Ep. In addition, IL-3 has been demonstrated to exert biologic effects with other target cell populations. These activities include the potentiation of the IL-2-dependent growth of normal T cells; the potentiation of the IL-2-dependent secretion of IgG by activated B cells; and the potentiation of the activities of eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes. The importance of any of these activities of IL-3 in vivo in either normal or stressed animals remains to be determined. Initial experiments in primates with IL-3 have yielded results consistent with its role as a regulator of early hematopoietic cell development. Although administration of IL-3 alone has relatively little effect on the levels of circulating blood cells, this treatment primes the animals to become hyper-responsive to subsequent administration of the later acting factors GM-CSF and Ep. Thus combinations of factors, at least in some situations, can provide a more potent stimulation of hematopoiesis than provided by the individual molecules, a finding that should greatly expand the utility of the different hematopoietins to more indications in the clinic.","['Yang, Y C', 'Clark, S C']","['Yang YC', 'Clark SC']","['Genetics Institute, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,['0 (Interleukin-3)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Genes', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', '*Interleukin-3/genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Primates', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1989 Sep;3(3):441-52.,,,,,,,,,,63,,

In contrast to the rapid elimination of cell surface CD4 by exposure of HL-60 to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the maximal reduction of CD4 by 1,25(OH)2D3 was attained within 48 h after the beginning of the exposure.","['Schlesinger, M', 'Bar-Shavit, Z', 'Hadar, R', 'Rabinowitz, R']","['Schlesinger M', 'Bar-Shavit Z', 'Hadar R', 'Rabinowitz R']","['Hubert H.

The diagnosis is based on hematological features, including a plasmacytosis exceeding 2 x 10(9)/l and any evidence of a clonal plasma cell proliferation. There are two forms of PCL: the primary form occurring in individuals without preceding multiple myeloma, and the secondary form arising as a late manifestation in patients with multiple myeloma. From 1974 to 1988 we diagnosed 8 primary PCL cases out of a total 301 multiple myeloma cases (incidence, 2.6%) and a total of 847 acute leukemia cases (incidence, 0.9%). During the same period we observed in 7 multiple myeloma patients a terminal PCL, for an incidence of PCL in myeloma of 2.3%. Most clinical characteristics were similar in both types of plasma cell leukemia. In particular we found no difference in the average age and in the incidence of bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, lytic bone lesions. None of our cases showed a clinically relevant lymphadenopathy either as presenting symptom or during the course of the disease. The values for hemoglobin, leukocytes, plasma cells, serum creatinine and calcium did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. The median survival was 7 months for patients with primary PCL and 1 month for patients with secondary PCL. 5 of the 8 patients with primary PCL obtained a response to conventional myeloma therapy including single alkylating agents, with a duration ranging from 7 to 44 months. Only 1 of the patients with secondary PCL had a partial response after combination chemotherapy.","['Bernasconi, C', 'Castelli, G', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Brusamolino, E']","['Bernasconi C', 'Castelli G', 'Pagnucco G', 'Brusamolino E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol Suppl,European journal of haematology.

The prevalence of abnormal karyotypes is unknown, but there is no evidence for malignant plasma cells or their precursors to have a normal karyotype. The chromosome changes found may be early events, but karyotypic evolution occurs early and rapidly. No specific structural or numerical chromosome anomaly is associated with multiple myeloma or plasma-cell leukemia. The changes found are those already known to occur in other B-cell malignancies, particularly B-CLL and diffuse small cell lymphoma. A 14Q + marker is present in about 30% of all karyotypically abnormal cases, and in 50% of the cases this is due to a t(11;14) (q13;q32). In a minority of cases deletions of 6q are found, and sporadically other B-cell translocations can be present. Karyotypes are often very complex with numerous structural anomalies involving mainly chromosomes 1, 11 and 17, and numerical anomalies involving chromosomes 3, 7, 9 and 11.

Normal B lymphocytes produce a number of these factors that subserve important regulatory functions in the combined processes of proliferation and differentiation. Also neoplastic B cells can release cytokines and, simultaneously, respond to the same factors in an autocrine circuit that supports their malignant growth. In addition, tumor cells can make use of the factors released by normal cells, either spontaneously or under the influence of inductive signals from the neoplastic cells. Inappropriate or excessive release of cytokines may have an important role in the pathophysiology of some clinical features.

Using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting techniques, we have further investigated the expression of vimentin and lamins A and C during differentiation of these tumor cells along the macrophage or granulocytic pathway in response to the inducing effects of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or dimethyl sulfoxide. Our results show that, while the expression of lamin B remains largely unchanged, the synthesis of vimentin and lamins A and C is dramatically enhanced during the maturation of HL-60 cells along both hemopoietic pathways. Northern blot analysis of cellular RNAs isolated from untreated and TPA-treated HL-60 cell populations as well as from control HeLa cells was performed using two oligonucleotides, one complementary to the 5' region common to human lamin A/C mRNAs and the other to the 5' region of hamster vimentin mRNA. Very low but still detectable amounts of vimentin and lamin A/C mRNAs were found in untreated HL-60 cell population, in accordance with the detection of small quantities of vimentin and lamins A and C in these populations. This is probably due to the presence of a small number of spontaneously differentiating cells.

Marrow was taken from HLA-identical sibling donors (16 patients) (pts), HLA-identical unrelated donor (1 pt), or one-antigen-missmatched sibling donor (1 pt). Preparatory regimen consisted of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose VP-16 (50-70 mg/kg body weight). At the time of BMT nine of the pts were not in complete remission (CR): seven pts were refractory to aggressive multiagent chemotherapy and two pts were in first relapse. Six pts were in second CR, one pt in third CR; three pts grafted in first CR carried additional risk factors; e.g. induction failure. Ten out of the nineteen pts are alive and free of disease between one and 53 months (median, 28 months) after BMT. The actuarial disease-free survival rate is 37% for pts with ANLL and 54% for pts with ALL. Six pts have died from BMT-related complications. Only three pts (1 pt with ALL, 2 pts with ANLL) have relapsed between day +106 and day +134 after BMT and subsequently died. The four-year actuarial relapse rates of 29% for ANLL and 14% for ALL, respectively, demonstrate that the combination of fractionated total body irradiation and high-dose VP-16 is an effective antileucemic regimen for children with advanced leukemias.","['Suttorp, M', 'Schmitz, N', 'Leuschner, S', 'Appelt, M', 'Rister, M', 'Schaub, J']","['Suttorp M', 'Schmitz N', 'Leuschner S', 'Appelt M', 'Rister M', 'Schaub J']","[""University Children's Hospital, Kiel, West Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Dec;4 Suppl 4:144-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

They act on different biochemical levels towards DNA-synthesis. Fludarabine is a purin analogue and seems very active in treating CLL. Tiazofurin is an antimetabolite counter-acting nicotinic acid with most promising activity in CML blast crisis. Other substances include deoxycoformycin, an adenosine analogue for treatment of T-cell neoplasias, 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D 3 as differentiation inducer, and homoharringtonine, an alkylating agent widely used for treating de novo AML in China. New anthracyclines are THP-adriamycin, fluoroadriamycin, and 4-demethoxydaunorubicin. Amsacrine (mAMSA) finally, is a synthetic aminoacridine with DNA-intercalating properties. The intact acridine ring appears essential for antitumor activity. The plasma clearance of both total amsacrine and unchanged parent species is biphasic. There is a considerable influence of hepatic and renal impairment on plasma clearance. Clinical toxicities include marked myelosuppression, gastrointestinal symptomes, phlebitis, mucocutaneous lesions, occasionally alopecia and neurotoxities. It is a very active drug, particularly in treating AML. Studies using mAMSA alone or in combination revealed comparable results to the anthracyclines. The E.O.R.T.C. Leukemia Cooperative Group has used successfully mAMSA in several trials: relapsed and refractory AML, intensive maintenance treatment during first remission in AML, and, still on-going, during intensive consolidation randomized against BMT in AML-patients under the age of 45 years, and randomized against standard consolidation between the age of 45 and 60 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jehn, U']",['Jehn U'],"['Medizinische Klinik III, University of Munich, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Dec;4 Suppl 3:53-8.,,,,,,,,,,0,,

Leukaemia Working Party of the European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group (EBMTG).,38-9,This retrospective survey of the EBMT Leukaemia Working Parking describes 78 patients with myelodysplasia (MDS) or secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia (sAML) who were given an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). The status of underlying disease at the time of transplantation was prognostic for the two-year disease-free survival which was 60% for patients transplanted in complete remission. Similar results were obtained for those with less advanced MDS (50-64%) who had not received any prior intensive chemotherapy. The results were significantly less favourable for those with more advanced disease who only partially responded to prior intensive chemotherapy (18%) while none of those who either relapsed or were resistant to chemotherapy survived. Allogeneic BMT can therefore be considered as curative treatment for patients with MDS. Patients with sAML who have a histocompatible donor should be given chemotherapy intensive enough to induce complete remission. If this is achieved these individuals have a prognosis comparable to those with de novo AML in first remission after BMT.,"['De Witte, T', 'Zwaan, F', 'Hermans, J', 'Vernant, J', 'Kolb, H', 'Vossen, J', 'Lonnqvist, B', 'Beelen, D', 'Ferrant, A', 'Gmur, J']","['De Witte T', 'Zwaan F', 'Hermans J', 'Vernant J', 'Kolb H', 'Vossen J', 'Lonnqvist B', 'Beelen D', 'Ferrant A', 'Gmur J', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Dec;4 Suppl 3:38-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A minimum of two courses of consolidation treatment beyond CR is advised to achieve a state of ""minimal residual disease"". In an attempt at cure patients should receive either an allogeneic BMT (less than 50 years of age) or autologous BMT (less than 60 years of age) and we currently recommend the additional use of IL2 after ABMT. Beyond 60 autologous BMT is presently not considered justified until the safety of this intensive/experimental approach is clarified. We do advocate intensive induction (needing less support than less intensive treatment) followed by consolidation therapy.

Acute leukaemias are clonal malignant neoplastic diseases which do not originate from transformation of totipotent haematopoietic stem cells, but of progenitors committed to myeloid, T-lymphatic or B-lymphatic differentiation lines. The transforming event seems to be associated with a nonrandom aberrant DNA rearrangement. Although leukaemic population is clonal, originating from a single cell, it exhibits phenotypic, and sometimes even karyotype heterogeneity. In the proposed human acute leukaemias classification leukaemic cells are allocated to a particular differentiation cell line on the basis of a positive finding of the lineage specific differentiation marker.

Ornithine decarboxylase belongs to those 20 or so enzymes or binding proteins, the genes for which are easily amplified under suitable selection pressure. This also applies to the human enzyme. Gene amplification of ornithine decarboxylase is not the only means to acquire resistance to inhibitors of the enzyme, as its overproduction can occur through an enhanced transcription or even through a more efficient translation of normal mRNA amounts. The resistance in human tumors can likewise be acquired by activating other enzymes, such as arginase. In contrast to the multigene family in mouse, it appears that in the human genome only two ornithine decarboxylase genes are present mapping to the chromosomes 2 and 7. Out of these, at least the sequences in the short arm of chromosome 2 are transcriptionally active and amplifiable. Human ornithine decarboxylase also belongs to those proteins which show a positive correlation between gene hypomethylation and expression. The genes of human ornithine decarboxylase are methylated to varying extents and distinct hypomethylation is seen in certain malignant cells, most notably human lymphatic leukemia cells. The human ornithine decarboxylase gene is easily transferrable into other mammalian cells in which it is efficiently expressed. Some indirect evidence seems to indicate that overproduction of ornithine decarboxylase may confer a growth advantage to mammalian cells. A further piece of information suggesting an important role for the enzyme is the fact that the structure of the ornithine decarboxylase gene is extremely well conserved during evolution. This does not apply only to the coding region but also to the overall organization of the gene itself.","['Janne, J', 'Alhonen, L', 'Hirvonen, A', 'Wahlfors, J']","['Janne J', 'Alhonen L', 'Hirvonen A', 'Wahlfors J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,['EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(89)90065-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1989;28:81-91. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(89)90065-4.,['CA 37695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,40,,

Mean age was 22.6 (SD 9.5) years. 24 patients were males and 5 females. Lymphadenopathy was present in 25 patients, hepatomegaly in 16 and splenomegaly in 14. Seventeen patients had a mediastinal mass. Anemia was present in 41% of patients and thrombocytopenia in 50%. The mean leukocyte count was 71 x 10(9)/l (SD 93). Bone marrow infiltration was found in 25 patients. The acid phosphatase reaction was positive, centrosomal type, in all cases except two. The immunophenotypic study classified the ATLS patients in the subtypes pre-T (10 cases), cortical thymic (15 cases), and mature thymic (4 patients). The cases with pre-T phenotype had a greater degree of bone marrow infiltration and lower frequency of mediastinal mass than the rest of patients. The rate of complete remissions (CR) was 83%. At the time of closing the study 12 patients had relapsed, with a median time of CR of 9.4 months. In addition, 11 patients had died, with a median survival of the series of 19 months. The results of the present study indicate that, despite some heterogeneity, those cases of ATLS with a more immature immunological phenotype (pre-T) have clinical and biological features more akin to acute leukemia, unlike those with a thymic phenotype (cortical or mature), which would be closer to lymphoblastic lymphoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ribera, J M', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Matutes, E', 'Campo, E', 'Granena, A', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Ribera JM', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Matutes E', 'Campo E', 'Granena A', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']",,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1989/10/28 00:00,1989/10/28 00:01,['1989/10/28 00:00'],"['1989/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1989 Oct 28;93(13):481-5.,,Sindromes linfoproliferativos T agudos.

However, the procedure can be highly toxic. Fractionated and low dose rate TBI has been said to enhance therapeutic ratio by increasing normal tissue tolerance and increasing leukemic cell kill. We report here the acute toxic effects and preliminary results on 2 consecutively groups of patients, treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for leukemia or multiple myeloma, and conditioned by 2 TBI regimens. Group A patients received 10 Gy-Co-60 single dose of TBI plus 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide over a period of 2 days (8 Gy lungs). Group B received 12 Gy Co-60 of TBI in 6 fractions (2/day), (8 Gy lungs) plus 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide over a period of 3 days. The acute toxic effects recorded were similar in both groups. Only a 40% vs 0% (P = 0.02) incidence of parotiditis in groups A and B favors fractionation. Other results obtained to date are as follows: an incidence of interstitial pneumonitis of 39% and 31% (ns); relapses of 10% and 20% (ns), and mortality of 55% and 60% for each group respectively. An interesting finding was that IP was associated with acute grade II-IV graft vs host disease in 87% and 100% of cases of group A and B, respectively.

Since the peptide contains a Cys26-X2-Cys29-X4-His34-X2-Cys39 sequence that is shared by all retroviral gag polyproteins which has been proposed to be a metal binding region, it was of considerable interest to examine the metal binding properties of the complete p10 protein. As postulated, p10 binds the metal ions Cd(II), Co(II), and Zn(II). The Co(II) protein shows a set of d-d absorption bands typical of a tetrahedral Co(II) complex at 695 (epsilon = 565 M-1 cm-1), 642 (epsilon = 655 M-1 cm-1), and 615 nm (epsilon = 510 M-1 cm-1) and two intense bands at 349 (epsilon = 2460 M-1 cm-1) and 314 nm (epsilon = 4240 M-1 cm-1) typical of Co(II)----(-)S- charge transfer. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum also indicates Cd(II) binding by the appearance of a Cd(II)----(-)S- charge-transfer band at 255 nm. The 113Cd NMR spectrum of 113Cd(II)-p10 reveals one signal at delta = 648 ppm. This chemical shift correlates well with that predicted for ligation of 113Cd(II) to three -S- from the three Cys residues of p10.

Progress is largely due to improved disease-free survival of poor-prognosis subgroups, improved sanctuary therapy, shortening of therapy duration, and salvage of relapsed patients by use of better chemotherapy regimens and bone marrow transplantation. Nonetheless, more children continue to die of ALL than of any other childhood cancer. This article reviews the progress and indicates remaining problems in the staging and treatment of ALL. Remaining problems include a lack of standardization between staging systems, variable application and interpretation of multivariate analysis, and occurrence of epiphenomenon. Also, to have statistical validity, clinical studies require numbers of patients larger than have been the case as results of treatment improve. Confusing also is the biological interface between ALL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the myeloid leukemias; the lack of reliable in vitro tests of chemosensitivity and chemoresistance; and the inability to quantitate residual leukemia after remission induction or to detect drug-resistant clones of cells before they are clinically manifest.

This distinction was to be of fundamental importance in the subsequent demonstration of distinct compartments in the lymphatic cell system. Animal studies and investigations on humans with congenital immune defects soon made it possible to differentiate between functionally different cell compartments in lymphatic tissue even on morphological grounds. This formed the basis for the subdivision of lymphatic tissue into B- and T-cell areas. A multiplicity of morphologically highly varied lymphatic neoplasias confronted this clear division. In principle, there are two possible explanations for the morphological and immunological heterogeneity of neoplasias: 1. The variety of lymphatic neoplasias is an expression of a dedifferentiation of cells in which neither the morphological picture nor the immunological properties of the stem cells are expressed. 2. Lymphatic neoplasias represent stages of ""arrested"" differentiation in the normal cell development. The present study attempts to demonstrate the distribution and development of normal T lymphocytes by analysis of their morphology and antigen constellation. The knowledge thus gained should then make it possible to define the neoplasias of the T-cell system. Thirty-six monoclonal antibodies were employed in addition to standard enzyme-histochemical methods for demonstration of cell antigens; some of the monoclonal antibodies were developed especially for this purpose. The study included normal tissue and samples from 148 lymphomas and leukemias of the T-cell system. Subdivision of the various entities was based on morphology, which enabled us to make a direct distinction between the morphologically defined entity and its corresponding phenotype. These phenotypic analyses of malignant T-cell lymphomas were conducted in pursuit of 3 basic goals: 1. To catch T-cell neoplasias in the full variety of their phenotypical spectrum by using assorted T-cell properties. 2. To bring these varied entities into a sequence corresponding to normal cell differentiation by correlating the neoplasias to normal cell compartments. 3. To determine the extent to which neoplastic equivalents exist for normal T cells with varied phenotypes and/or functional properties. A clear morphological subdivision of the T-cell neoplasias is already possible: 1. lymphoblastic lymphomas and leukemias; 2. peripheral or mature cell T-cell lymphomas. The lymphoblastic lymphomas and leukemias have until now been characterized primarily according to their positivity for the enzyme TdT. The T-lymphoblastic lymphomas and leukemias we analysed phenotypically shared the constant features of CD7 antigen expression, whereas other T-cell features showed a clear variability.","['Feller, A C']",['Feller AC'],['Pathologisches Institut der Universitat Wurzburg.'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Veroff Pathol,Veroffentlichungen aus der Pathologie,7504167,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*pathology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Veroff Pathol. 1989;131:1-175.,,Phanotypische Analyse humaner T-Zell-Lymphome unter Berucksichtigung der Zell-Differenzierung und morphologischen Klassifikation.,,,,,,,,,,

The latter may be induced by cytostatic therapy for cancer, extended immunosuppression following organ transplantation or HIV infection. The spectrum of secondary cancers is, however, different within these three groups of secondary immune defects with acute myeloid leukemia being the most common malignant disease after cytostatic therapy, with skin or lip cancer followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as the prevalent malignancies after organ transplantations and Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as the predominant cancers associated with HIV infection. The pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is possibly related to viral infections by cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus inducing an increased proliferation and possibly the coactivation of transforming genes of oncogenic potential. In AIDS patients Kaposi sarcoma is diagnosed in up to 40% of homosexual men while the other risk groups are less frequently involved. 4-10% of HIV infected patients experience non Hodgkin's lymphoma predominantly of B-cell type and intermediate or high grade malignancy with frequent extranodal manifestations. Other types of tumors occur at a substantially lower frequency and are not clearly related to the HIV infection.

A CT scan revealed bilateral thalamic hyperdense lesions and paraventricular small hematoma in the right hemisphere. Hematology showed marked leukocytosis (450,000/mm3), mild anemia and no coagulopathy including disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. Cytology showed myeloblasts with positive stain in peroxidase and negative in esterase both in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. These findings indicated M 1 type, myeloblastic leukemia without maturation, according to FAB (French-American-British Co-operative group) classification. CT scan on the second day demonstrated expansion of the hematoma in the right thalamus, and nine brand-new small hematomas in different locations. The patient deteriorated into brain death soon after this examination. The pathology of this case was supposed to be ""hyperleukocytosis"", which is defined as a leukocyte count greater than 100,000/mm3. Severe leukostasis due both to dense leukocytes and lack of mobility of the myeloblast brought about an increase in permeability because of local impairment of nutrition to the walls of the vessels. As a result, the following histological changes occurred: 1) cellular exudation into Virchow-Robin space, 2) the appearance of leukemic nodule, admixtures of leukemic cells and erythrocytes, 3) mechanical compression of the capillaries and venules by the enlarging mass of the leukemic nodules.

Air-dried blood and bone marrow films or cytospins were fixed in acetone, methanol-acetone, or methanol-acetone-formalin. A primary monoclonal antibody layer was employed with a corresponding biotinylated anti-species second layer. The third stage was avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and visualisation was achieved with Fast Red TR as diazo salt. This was compared using a limited range of primary antibodies with the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method, routinely performed as a five-stage technique. The ABAP technique provided a 2.5 h, reliable, three-stage immunophenotyping procedure without the need for amplification steps. A wider range of first layer monoclonals of any species could be utilised by using the appropriate secondary antibody. Preservation of cell morphology was very good. Smaller amounts of expensive monoclonal antibodies could be used compared to the quantity required with other slide techniques. This approach to immunophenotyping can consequently be employed by any general haematology laboratory to provide a sensitive and inexpensive service.

Empiric antibiotic therapy commencing at the onset of fever is selected according to three principles: intravenous therapy is used to rapidly achieve bactericidal serum levels, antibiotics with appropriate antibacterial spectra are required, and combinations of antibiotics have been preferred for their synergistic activity. Initial empiric monotherapy with single antibiotics such as imipenem which have a sufficiently broad antibacterial spectrum in their own right are potentially as efficacious as conventional combination therapies. Granulocytopenic periods complicated by fever are significantly longer in patients receiving chemotherapy for leukaemia than in patients undergoing treatment for lymphoma and solid tumours.

Experimental data mainly obtained with mice indicate that the most important risk exists during the period of organogenesis and concerns the induction of malformations. Although in man this period lies between about 10 and 80 days after fertilization for most organs, the main development of the brain occurs later, namely between the 8th and 15th week after conception. Data from Japanese victims of the atomic bomb explosions above Hiroshima and Nagasaki indicate that during development the brain is the most sensitive organ to irradiation and maximal sensitivity is found between the 8th and 15th week after fertilization. A dose of one Gray received during this period induces a severe mental retardation in about 45% of the newborns. The dose response relationship is not significantly different from a linear one without a threshold dose. Studies of intelligence and school performance have shown that 1 Gray received during the 8th-15th week causes a shift of the average intelligence of about 30 points. Irradiation before the 8th week and after the 25th week had no effect on intelligence or mental retardation. During the 16th and 25th week sensitivity was about one fourth of that during the 8th-15th week. Although the irradiation of the embryo and fetus should be avoided as much as possible, the new data have led to an abandonment of the so-called 10-day rule. Generally an accidental irradiation of the embryo or fetus of less than 5 cGy is not considered as a medical indication for abortion. Retrospective studies showed that mothers from children who died from leukemia or other childhood tumors, had been subjected to a diagnostic irradiation of the pelvis or lower abdomen more frequently than mothers from children that did not develop a tumor. It has been estimated that prenatal sensitivity for induction of leukemia and tumors is higher than sensitivity after birth. However, it is still in discussion, whether the relationship between prenatal irradiation and a higher incidence of tumors is of a causal nature.","['Vos, O']",['Vos O'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Boll Soc Ital Biol Sper,Bollettino della Societa italiana di biologia sperimentale,7506962,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced/*embryology', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*etiology', 'Japan', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Fallout/adverse effects', 'Radiography/adverse effects', 'Rats']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Boll Soc Ital Biol Sper. 1989 Jun;65(6):481-500.,,,,,,,,,,27,,

When cocultured in arginine-free medium, these targets displayed comparable or even higher levels of lysis. L1210 targets were lytically resistant under either condition. However, 59Fe release from this target did reflect strong dependence on the presence of arginine. The structural analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, was an effective inhibitor of iron-release from L1210 targets cocultured with activated macrophages, whereas it had minimal inhibitory effects on release of 51Cr from cocultured L929 cells.

These results show that LT and TNF exhibit qualitative differences in the effects on hematopoietic cells and that CML-cells display an increased susceptibility for the cytostatic effects on LT and TNF.","['Gullberg, U', 'Nilsson, E']","['Gullberg U', 'Nilsson E']","['Department of Medicine, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(89)90001-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(89)90001-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(11):953-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90001-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these 6 cases, 5 cases were interpreted to be positive by the confirmatory test of EIA (inhibitory rates of greater than 50%). Thus, the results of the confirmatory test were most consistent with those of WB methods. We also determined the levels of anti-HTLV-1 antibody in sera from the babies born of anti-HTLV-1 positive mothers at various months of age by the above three methods. As ages progressed, a parallel decline in the levels of anti-HTLV-1 antibody was shown by the three methods. However, at the time when sera became negative by both PA and EIA methods, the antibody was still detected by WB method.

CSFs stimulate the formation and differentiation of the erythrocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and platelets that compose the blood cell population. Recombinant CSFs represent a means by which the numbers of hematopoietic cells can be modulated, thus making these agents potentially useful in treating hematologic and immunologic deficiencies. CSFs also can increase the ability of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages to protect the body against foreign invasion. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has increased host defenses in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with Kaposi's sarcoma; increased neutrophil, platelet, and erythrocyte counts in preleukemic patients; and increased neutrophil counts in patients with aplastic anemia. GM-CSF and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have appeared to alleviate the drastic decrease in neutrophil counts associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. G-CSF also has shown promise in stimulating neutrophil production in patients with transitional cell carcinoma, congenital agranulocytosis, and hairy-cell leukemia. Mild adverse effects such as fever, chills, rash, fatigue, myalgia, and bone pain are associated with GM-CSF therapy; G-CSF therapy is associated mostly with mild to moderate bone pain. Areas of education for pharmacists working with biotherapeutic substances include stability, storage temperature, drug interactions, novel drug-delivery systems such as monoclonal antibodies or liposomes, variations in biologic activity, and the evolving nature of the information about these investigational drugs.

It was first described in association with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), where 90% of cases examined are Ph-positive. A similar cytogenetic abnormality has also been identified in the acute leukaemias but in a much lower percentage. The ubiquitous nature of the translocation in CML suggested that it was causally implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent work at the molecular level has corroborated this idea. As a consequence of the translocation, the Abelson protooncogene (ABL), located on chromosome 9 is moved to chromosome 22 where it is joined to a truncated gene, known as BCR. The result of this genomic reorganisation is a hybrid gene encoding a novel chimaeric protein product with enhanced protein tyrosine kinase activity. It is thought that it is this activity which is necessary for the generation of the leukaemic phenotype. The t(9;22) has provided a model to illustrate how cellular proto-oncogenes can be activated by chromosomal translocation and has stimulated interest in investigating other chromosomal translocations in human malignancies.","['Morgan, G J', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['Morgan GJ', 'Wiedemann LM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Recenti Prog Med,Recenti progressi in medicina,0401271,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/genetics', 'Molecular Biology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recenti Prog Med. 1989 Oct;80(10):508-19.,,,,,,,,,,164,,

It has been previously established that leukoregulin increases the sensitivity of sarcoma, carcinoma and leukemia cells to natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Tumor cells were treated with leukoregulin for 1 h at 37 degrees C and tested for sensitivity to NK and LAK cytotoxicity in a 4-h chromium-release assay. NK-resistant Daudi, QGU and C4-1 human cervical carcinoma cells became sensitive to NK cytotoxicity after leukoregulin treatment, and their sensitivity to LAK was increased two- to sixfold. Y-79 retinoblastoma cells, which are moderately sensitive to NK and very sensitive to LAK, became increasingly sensitive (two- to four-fold) to both NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity. Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), recombinant interleukin-1 (alpha and beta), recombinant interferon gamma, recombinant tumor necrosis factor or combinations of the latter two failed to up-regulate tumor cell sensitivity to NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity. However, treatment with recombinant interferon gamma for 16-18 h, GM-CSF and interleukin-1 beta for 1 h induced a state of target cell resistance to both NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity.

The response of AML cells to these growth factors is extremely heterogeneous, and the tilting of the balance between self-reproduction (leading to perpetuation of the leukaemic process) and differentiation ('death' of the malignant cells) depends on several parameters, on the type and combination of factors to which the cells are exposed, with IL-3 and GM-CSF tending to favour self-renewal, and G-CSF and M-CSF tending to favour differentiation.

All 20 neoplasms of myeloid, myelomonocytic, and presumed macrophage derivation reacted with antibody KP1. None of the 22 cases of T cell neoplasia had positive reactions. Although 14 of 41 B lineage lymphomas and leukaemias were stained by antibody KP1, staining was usually confined to small dots of reactivity, in contrast to the strong and extensive cytoplasmic staining seen in the neoplasms of myeloid and macrophage/monocyte origin. Furthermore, positive B cell neoplasms were almost all small cell proliferations, which are unlikely to be confused with myelomonocytic malignancies. It was concluded that antibody KP1 is a valuable addition to a panel of monoclonal antibodies for phenotyping lymphomas, particularly in routinely fixed tissues.

Results].,367-72,"Two different Total Body Irradiation (TBI) regimens were employed (1981 to July 1983) in Genoa in the conditioning program for the allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) of 22 patients suffering from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in remission (7 patients in 1st remission, and 15 in 2nd remission). All patients were treated with Cyclophosphamide -60 mg/kg administered for two consecutive days (day -7 and -6)--and subsequently underwent fractionated TBI (days -3, -2, -1), that is, our conventional TBI regimen: 3.3 Gy/day per 3 days (total dose: 9.9 Gy). From August 1983 through 1988, 33 patients (14 in 1st remission and 19 in 2nd remission) were given 2 Gy twice a day, 6 hours apart, for 3 consecutive days (total dose: 12 Gy). Cyclosporine A was used for GvHD prophylaxis. At 58 months, out of the total figure of ALL patients in 2nd remission, 19% of those treated with 9.9 Gy/3 fr/3 days (fractionated TBI) is likely to be in remission, versus 65% of the cases treated with 12 Gy/6 fr/3 days (p less than 0.01) (hyperfractionated TBI); the actuarial overall survival is 23% after fractionated vs 60% after hyperfractionated TBI (p = 0.05). The incidence of idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis was very low (3.6%). Thus, we conclude that, in ALL patients in second remission, hyperfractionated TBI (12 Gy/6 fr/3 days) yields better results than fractionated TBI (9.9 Gy/3 fr/3 days), with lower relapse rate (33% vs 83%) and higher survival.","['Corvo, R', 'Frassoni, F', 'Franzone, P', 'Barra, S', 'Guenzi, M', 'Orsatti, M', 'Fiorino, R', 'Scarpati, D', 'Vitale, V']","['Corvo R', 'Frassoni F', 'Franzone P', 'Barra S', 'Guenzi M', 'Orsatti M', 'Fiorino R', 'Scarpati D', 'Vitale V']",,['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Radiol Med,La Radiologia medica,0177625,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiol Med. 1989 Oct;78(4):367-72.,,Irradiazione corporea totale frazionata e iperfrazionata nel condizionamento del trapianto di midollo osseo allogenico nella leucemia linfatica acuta.

A clear dependence of protein concentration of nuclear extracts on transcriptional enhancement was observed with the epsilon-globin gene. To examine the cis-acting DNA sequences 5' of the promoter region which may be important in specific expression of globin genes, the epsilon-globin template was truncated using restriction enzymes. Transcriptional activity of the epsilon-globin gene varied according to the truncation suggesting possible regions to which nuclear proteins involved in transcription may bind. Fractionation of nuclear extracts by ion exchange chromatography indicated that activity could be recovered in a 175 mM ammonium sulfate fraction while the 50 mM ammonium sulfate fraction decreased transcription activity. A/gamma globin gene and Ad2MLP could be transcribed in nuclear extracts at higher concentrations, however, beta-globin and the insulin gene were not transcribed at any concentration assayed, either from induced or uninduced cells.

Glycosylation of CD4 has been shown to be necessary for proper surface expression. To study the biosynthesis and assembly of CD4, wild-type and glycosylation-deficient mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cotransfected with a cDNA encoding CD4 and a cDNA for the human multiple drug resistance gene, which allowed the amplification of the transfected CD4 cDNA sequences. Clones were isolated that exhibited high-level expression of CD4 resulting from the integration of several copies of CD4 cDNA. CD4 synthesized by these cells acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H after 20-30 min of chase, suggesting a rapid translocation of the glycoprotein from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi apparatus. The sensitivity of CD4 to glycosidases suggested the presence of biantennary unsialylated complex-type oligosaccharides. Consistent with this, CD4 synthesized by the Lec2 mutant, which does not add sialic acid to oligosaccharides, was identical to the glycoprotein produced by wild-type CHO cells.

Generally, it was found that multifunctional compounds (esters with greater than 1 functional vinyl group) required lower concentrations than monofunctional compounds to induce maximal cytotoxic, mutagenic, and clastogenic responses. In addition, acrylates were generally more potent than their corresponding methacrylates. This information and these comparative activities will provide some guidance for setting priorities of concern for hazard consideration for acrylate/methacrylate ester compounds.","['Dearfield, K L', 'Millis, C S', 'Harrington-Brock, K', 'Doerr, C L', 'Moore, M M']","['Dearfield KL', 'Millis CS', 'Harrington-Brock K', 'Doerr CL', 'Moore MM']","['Health Effects Division, US Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '0 (Mutagens)']",IM,"['Acrylates/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Methacrylates/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests', '*Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/4.5.381 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1989 Sep;4(5):381-93. doi: 10.1093/mutage/4.5.381.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bcr-abl gene product (P210bcr-abl) is a structurally altered and enzymatically activated form of the normal c-abl gene product. P210bcr-abl is expressed in two cell lines derived from CML patients in blast crisis: K562 and EM2. Activation of protein kinase C by the strong tumor promoter TPA induced dramatic changes in K562 cells. We have shown that exposure of K562 cells to low concentrations (10 nM) of TPA stopped cell division and sharply reduced the expression of P210bcr-abl. In contrast, similar treatment of EM2 cells resulted in a slightly increased proliferation rate and stimulation of P210bcr-abl expression. A second tumor promoter, mezerein, also dramatically reduced P210 levels in K562 cells and elevated them in EM2 cells. These observations establish that expression of the bcr-abl gene can be either increased or decreased, depending on the cell type, and that these effects correlate with the proliferative state of the cell. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that P210bcr-abl plays an important role in the maintenance of CML.","['Li, W J', 'Smith, L A', 'Kabat, K G', 'Kloetzer, W S', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Li WJ', 'Smith LA', 'Kabat KG', 'Kloetzer WS', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Johnson & Johnson Biotechnology Center, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Diterpenes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1989;3(3):113-23.,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47372/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The ages at BMT varied from 1.0 to 12.9 years. Preoperative treatment included high doses of cyclophosphamide and in children with acute leukaemia also 10 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). The median observation period following BMT was 3.9 years. The control group comprised 85 age and sex matched healthy children. In comparison to the controls, all linear measurements studied were found to be significantly diminished in children conditioned with TBI. For variables describing vertical dimensions, the degree of reduction appeared to be associated with the patients' ages at the time of irradiation. It was concluded that the disturbance in dental development, which is also a consequence of TBI, could be partly responsible for this association. Children who were not conditioned with TBI exhibited no significant differences when compared to controls in respect of the variables studied.","['Dahllof, G', 'Forsberg, C M', 'Ringden, O', 'Bolme, P', 'Borgstrom, B', 'Nasman, M', 'Heimdahl, A', 'Modeer, T']","['Dahllof G', 'Forsberg CM', 'Ringden O', 'Bolme P', 'Borgstrom B', 'Nasman M', 'Heimdahl A', 'Modeer T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Orthod,European journal of orthodontics,7909010,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Face/*anatomy & histology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Maxillofacial Development', 'Vertical Dimension', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.ejo.a036004 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Orthod. 1989 Nov;11(4):332-40. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.ejo.a036004.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoid cells were randomly selected by a trained observer from real-time images of Papanicolaou-fixed and -stained cytospin smears prepared from pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial effusions. The lymphoid cells were classified by the instrument, based on the size and shape of their nuclear profiles. The morphometric data collected by the instrument were interpreted by a simple rule-based expert system that classified the smears as benign or malignant. One hundred four cases, including 28 malignant lymphomas, 63 benign lymphocytoses, 8 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and 5 cases with incomplete immunopathologic data, were studied retrospectively. Sixty-three of these effusions had been stained to detect light chain monoclonality. Ninety-one effusions were correctly classified by the expert system. There were four potential false negative diagnoses and one potential false positive diagnosis by the CIM system. Eight effusions from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were consistently classified as benign. Although the author's series of patients with a history of CLL is small, their results suggest that CIM is unsuitable for the diagnosis of malignancy in these effusions. If only those effusions from patients with a history of CLL are excluded, the predictive value of a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was 96.5%, whereas the predictive value of a diagnosis of benign lymphocytosis was 94.0%.","['Walts, A E', 'Marchevsky, A M']","['Walts AE', 'Marchevsky AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90048.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Ascitic Fluid/*cytology', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*standards', '*Expert Systems', 'Humans', 'Karyometry/instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Observer Variation', 'Pericardial Effusion/*diagnosis', 'Pleural Effusion/*diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/92.6.765 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1989 Dec;92(6):765-72. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/92.6.765.,,,,,['Am J Clin Pathol 1990 Oct;94(4):526'],,,,,,,

Under normal circumstances, more than 99.9% is resorbed in the proximal tubuli of the kidneys and is metabolized there. In renal disease with damage to this segment of the nephron, eg acute tubulo-interstitial nephropathy, increased quantities of beta 2M are excreted in the urine. If the rate of glomerular filtration is reduced, serum-beta 2M is increased and this is also the case in persons with increased cell division despite normal renal function. Serum-beta 2M is, therefore, raised in numerous malignant diseases and reflects the size of the tumour mass. During cytostatic treatment of myelomatosis and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, the serum-beta 2M levels decrease on remission and increase on relapse. In acute leukaemia and malignant lymphoma with infiltration of the CNS, similar conditions prevail for CSF-beta 2M. beta 2M is a sensitive but non-specific parameter in inflammation and infection. Determination of beta 2M in saliva has been found to be of value in Sjogren's syndrome. In HIV-positive patients, a high serum-beta 2M level is a poor prognostic sign. Determinations of CSF-beta 2M in AIDS patients must be presumed to be of value not only in the diagnosis of cerebral AIDS and other (latent) CNS infections but also to demonstrate complicating cerebral malignant lymphomata at an early stage.","['Hansen, P B', 'Olsen, N V']","['Hansen PB', 'Olsen NV']",,['dan'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,['0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Infections/metabolism', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Kidney Diseases/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*metabolism']",1989/11/06 00:00,1989/11/06 00:01,['1989/11/06 00:00'],"['1989/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 1989 Nov 6;151(45):2960-2.,,Beta-2-mikroglobulin ved medicinske sygdomme.,,,,,,,,30,,

Proliferation of AML blasts of 24 patients was assessed in semisolid (containing 0.9% methylcellulose) and in liquid cultures, in which identical concentrations of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) had been provided. In all but one of the cases, significant DNA synthesis (evaluated by 3H-thymidine uptake) was observed when the cells were incubated in the liquid system, whereas in only 14 cases (58%), the cells were able to form clusters or colonies in the semisolid system. These findings suggest that AML cells from a large proportion of patients can proliferate only after stimulation with CSFs in a liquid system, i.e. when cultured under conditions permitting reciprocal contact between the cells. To establish further the importance of cell to cell contact for AML cell proliferation, cells from 19 patients were cultured in liquid medium concurrently in flat bottom microwells (in which a majority of the cells lie separate) and in round bottom microwells (in which cells show a tendency to aggregate). A significantly higher 3H-thymidine (TdR) incorporation in the round bottom cultures was observed in 15 out of 19 cases. The role of the leukocyte function antigens (LFA) LFA1, Mac1, P150-95 in this phenomenon was then analyzed, as these structurally related glycoproteins are involved in reactions requiring contact between hematopoietic cells. Membrane expression of the three antigens was first examined in 16 patients. LFA1, Mac1 and P150-95 were expressed on the AML cells of 15, 6 and 8 patients, respectively. Expression of these antigens did not change following short term incubation of the AML cells in the presence of CSFs. AML cells cultured in presence of saturating concentrations of monoclonal antibodies reacting with structures of these 3 antigens in order to abrogate their function did not suppress 3H-TdR uptake. Thus, no direct role for LFA1 and/or Mac1 and/or P150-95 antigens in mediating contact-induced AML proliferation could be demonstrated. It remains to be established which components are involved in the cell-cell contact-mediated upregulation of AML cell proliferation.","['Pulsoni, A', 'Delwel, R', 'Salem, M', 'Touw, I', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Pulsoni A', 'Delwel R', 'Salem M', 'Touw I', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/physiology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', '*Cell Division', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/physiology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90041-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(10):883-91. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90041-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These immuno-conjugates combine the potency of the parent toxin with the specificity of the attached ligand. Toxins used in the construction of immunotoxins belong to a group of peptides that catalytically inhibit the elongation step of protein synthesis, and include ricin, abrin, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, diptheria toxin, and alpha-sarcin. To synthesize immunotoxins, the normal cell-binding function must be removed by chemical cleavage or modification, or in the case of toxins that have been cloned, genetic engineering used to delete amino acids critical to cell binding. Covalent linkage of toxin to ligand generally involves a disulfide or thioether bond, though recently, recombinant toxin molecules with ligands that are genetically engineered into the protein have been made. The most successful clinical application of immunotoxins has been in the depletion of T cells from allogeneic bone marrow grafts to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Clinical trials have been conducted using immunotoxins for the systemic treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), GVHD, and selected solid tumors. With the possible exception of GVHD, responses have been limited. Obstacles have included rapid systemic clearance, poor delivery to extravascular tumor deposits, and humoral immune responses to the immunotoxin. Research to overcome these problems is in progress and should lead to a better definition of the role of immunotoxins in the therapy of malignancies.","['Hertler, A A', 'Frankel, A E']","['Hertler AA', 'Frankel AE']","['Section of Hematology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/therapeutic use']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1989.7.12.1932 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1989 Dec;7(12):1932-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1989.7.12.1932.,,,,,,,,,,100,,

The APAAP method showed clear distinct labelling of antigen positive cells without loss of antigens due to decalcification. Both normal or reactive single cells present in the sample and neoplastic cell populations could be identified morphologically and their antigenic phenotype and cellular origin, whether lymphoid or myeloid, established.

Possible involvement of protein kinase C.",19710-5,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) regulates the expression of c-myc protooncogene in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (Reitzma, P. H., Rothberg, P. G., Astrin, S. M., Trial, J., Barshavit, Z., Hall, A., Teitelbaum, S. U., and Kahn, A. J. (1983) Nature 306, 492-494). The regulation of c-myc expression occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level (Simpson, R. U., Hsu, T., Begley, D. A., Mitchell, B. S., and Alizadeh, B. N. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4104-4108). Also, 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates an increase in protein kinase C (PKC) levels and inhibitors of PKC block 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells (Martell, R. E., Simpson, R. U., and Taylor, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5570-5575). In this report we demonstrated that sphinganine, an inhibitor of PKC that is mechanistically and structurally distinct from 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine-HCl (H-7), also blocks 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of HL-60 cell differentiation. The effect of inhibitors of PKC on 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of c-myc transcription was examined. H-7 (18 microM) and sphinganine (3 and 6 microM) blunted 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced reduction of c-myc transcription as assessed by nuclear run-off assays. We showed that c-myc/beta-actin ratios (cpm/cpm, % of control mean +/- S.E.) were as follows: ethanol control, 100 +/- 14%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, 17 +/- 5%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 6 microM H-7, 13 +/- 6%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 18 microM H-7, 53 +/- 6% 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 18 microM N-[2-guanidinoethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (HA-1004), 10 +/- 8%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 6 microM sphinganine, 49 +/- 8%. No significant differences in c-myc transcription between control, 18 microM H-7, 18 microM HA-1004, and 3 or 6 microM sphinganine-treated cells were observed. The block in c-myc transcription was beyond exon 1, and regulation of exon 1 transcription by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was not detected. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expression of markers for HL-60 cell differentiation was more rapidly induced by 25 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate than 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, suggesting that direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters may make processes required for 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of differentiation unnecessary. In summary, these data suggest that a primary effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cells is to regulate PKC levels, and regulation of c-myc transcription by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is a result of this action.","['Simpson, R U', 'Hsu, T', 'Wendt, M D', 'Taylor, J M']","['Simpson RU', 'Hsu T', 'Wendt MD', 'Taylor JM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0626.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1989/11/25 00:00,1989/11/25 00:01,['1989/11/25 00:00'],"['1989/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)47171-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 25;264(33):19710-5.,"['CA 36507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

At similar concentrations (between 10 and 15 micrograms/ml), leukemia-derived CAMAL caused profound inhibition of normal colony growth in the myeloid progenitor cell assay but had no inhibitory effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) growth from myeloid leukemia patients in active disease states. These preliminary results indicated the myeloid leukemia cells possessed apparent differences in responsiveness to CAMAL-mediated regulation compared to normal cells.

Immunostaining with Ki-67 provides a simple method with which to determine the growth fraction of a malignant cell population without requiring a laborious procedure or use of radioactive materials. Thus far, detection of Ki-67-positive cells by flow cytometry was limited because of nuclear location of the antigen. In this study, periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) fixation of cells in suspension, labeling with Ki-67, and the subsequent flow cytometric analysis of the tumor growth fraction is described. Fixation with PLP at -10 degrees C for 15 min rendered the plasma membrane permeable without destroying cell surface antigens. Thus double immunofluorescence studies using both a surface marker and Ki-67 could be performed. This offers the additional advantage of being able to define the phenotype of proliferating cells. This method was applied to determine the growth fraction in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of patients with leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The results of Ki-67 studies in 91 patients are shown. A wide variability of individual Ki-67 values was observed within each entity. Use of this flow cytometric procedure substantially facilitates the quantification of proliferating cells in pathological blood and bone marrow samples.","['Drach, J', 'Gattringer, C', 'Glassl, H', 'Schwarting, R', 'Stein, H', 'Huber, H']","['Drach J', 'Gattringer C', 'Glassl H', 'Schwarting R', 'Stein H', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/analysis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/analysis/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*analysis/pathology', 'Phenotype']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990100612 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1989 Nov;10(6):743-9. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990100612.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the most important aspects of the erythroleukemia can be caused by a single SFFV infection in the absence of any helper virus. The SFFV env gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein, gp55. This glycoprotein, when expressed on erythroblast surfaces, causes a constitutive mitogenesis. However, SFFV infections only rarely increase the cell's self-renewal capability or abrogate its commitment to differentiate. Therefore, the consequence of infection is initially a polyclonal erythroblastosis. This polyclonal proliferation usually leads to cell differentiation and to recovery unless helper virus is present to cause continuing infection of new erythroblasts. Extremely rare SFFV proviral integrations, however, result in abrogation of the cell's commitment to differentiate and in the concomitant acquisition of cell immortality. These immortalizing proviral integrations occur at only a small number of sites in the mouse genome. Therefore, the mitogenic and immortalizing stages of erythroleukemia are now known to be caused by discrete genetic events--the first involving the SFFV env gene and the second involving the rare proviral integration sites. In early investigations of Friend virus, the first stage always preceded the second stage by at least several weeks. Now it is known that this delay in onset of the second stage is caused solely by statistics. Every SFFV-infected erythroblast is mitogenically activated, yet only rarely does the SFFV proviral integration produce immortality. Both steps in leukemogenesis can be caused simultaneously in an erythroblast by a rare single SFFV proviral integration. There has been an explosion of interest in retroviral env gene-mediated pathogenesis. Such pathogenesis has been recently associated with most of the naturally transmitted retroviral diseases including AIDS. Such pathogenesis involves in different viruses immunosuppression, anemia, neuropathy, and leukemia (Mathes et al. 1978; Simon et al. 1984, 1987; Weiss et al. 1985; Lifson et al. 1986; Riedel et al. 1986; Sitbon et al. 1986; Sodroski et al. 1986; Mitani et al. 1987; Schmidt et al. 1987; Klase et al. 1988; Overbaugh et al. 1988a, b). The shuffling and dynamic env gene rearrangements that have been associated with murine retroviral leukemogenesis have also now been seen in FeLV-FAIDS and HIV (Fisher et al. 1988; Overbaugh et al. 1 t88b; Saag et al. 1988; Tersmette et al. 1988). Friend virus provides an important established example of such env gene pathogenesis. Although we still do not understand precisely how gp55 causes erythroblast mitosis, workers in this field have discovered important clues that may lead to answers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kabat, D']",['Kabat D'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gene Products, env', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-74700-7_1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1989;148:1-42. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74700-7_1.,,,,,,,,,,235,,

We have studied nuclear c-myc and c-myb oncoproteins through the cell cycle, during macrophage, granulocyte, erythroid, and megakaryocytic differentiation of KG1, HL60, and HEL cells. p62c-myc and p75c-myb content of propidium iodide-stained nuclei was quantitated by flow cytometry using fluoresceinated antibodies CT14-G4 and MB4.3, respectively. In uninduced cells p62c-myc content is highest in HL60, followed by HEL, then KG1, while p75c-myb is highest in HEL, followed by HL60 and KG1. All lines showed a less than 2-fold increment in both oncoproteins over the cell cycle. Macrophage induction of KG1 and HL60 resulted in early increase in both oncoproteins, followed by a decline to less than starting values by 48 h, concurrent with a reduction of S phase cells and the appearance of adherent alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase-positive cells. p62c-myc changes were more pronounced in HL60 and p75c-myb changes in KG1. Different patterns of oncoprotein expression were found when different inducing agents were used for granulocyte differentiation of HL60. Under all conditions, however, both oncoproteins declined to basal levels before granulocyte maturity. Hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of HEL to hemoglobin-containing cells resulted in biphasic p62c-myc and p75c-myb kinetics. In contrast, dimethyl sulfoxide-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of HEL was accompanied by an early and steady decline in both oncoproteins. Despite considerable reduction in oncoprotein levels, HEL cells were still actively cycling at 120 h. It appears that c-myc and c-myb proteins decline with differentiation, well before proliferation ceases in some lineages. The kinetics of the decline differ between the two oncogenes and vary with the lineage induced and the nature of the inducing agent used. The cell cycle distribution of the oncoproteins does not change during maturation. These data suggest disparate roles for c-myc versus c-myb during hemopoietic differentiation and the existence of multiple signal transduction pathways for down-regulation of these genes.","['Pedrazzoli, P', 'Bains, M A', 'Watson, R', 'Fisher, J', 'Hoy, T G', 'Jacobs, A']","['Pedrazzoli P', 'Bains MA', 'Watson R', 'Fisher J', 'Hoy TG', 'Jacobs A']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Dec 15;49(24 Pt 1):6911-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the success of this procedure improves, there will be continuing concern for the consequences of such treatment. One such concern is the long-term hematopoietic function of recipients following marrow transplantation. There is evidence that bone marrow stem cells are limited in self-renewal capacity. Under circumstances of exposure to certain cytotoxic agents or to great proliferative stress, and following transplantation of marrow into lethally irradiated recipients, bone marrow stem cells undergo a permanent loss of self-renewal capacity. This loss is not initially reflected in peripheral blood counts or in marrow cellularity, but can be determined by a decrease in marrow stem cell content and by assays measuring self renewal. Animal work suggests that survival may be decreased following this loss in self-renewal. In order to limit the adverse effect of this phenomenon, efforts should be made to optimize both the quantity and quality of donor marrow engrafted. This should be possible by transplanting the largest number of marrow cells feasible, and by avoiding prior exposure to cytotoxic agents that are known to damage early stem cells in those patients who are possible candidates for autologous marrow transplantation. The use of lymphokines and peripheral stem cell harvests in transplantation should be carefully monitored as self renewal of engrafted marrow may also be decreased following these new techniques.","['Mauch, P', 'Ferrara, J', 'Hellman, S']","['Mauch P', 'Ferrara J', 'Hellman S']","['Joint Center for Radiation Therapy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Factors/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1989 Nov;4(6):601-7.,,,,,,,,,,84,,

All patients received marrow from an HLA identical sibling after preparation with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and total body irradiation (TBI) 330 cGy on each of the three days prior to transplantation. There was a difference of +/- 18% between the nominal total dose of 990 cGy and the actual dose received as indicated by dosimetric recordings. While interstitial pneumonitis had minimal impact on survival (4%) there was a considerable difference in the incidence of relapses. The incidence of relapse was 55% versus 11% in patients receiving less or more than 990 cGy respectively and this had a major impact on survival (38% v. 74% at 7 years) since transplant-related mortality was comparable in the two groups. A multivariate Cox analysis indicated that a lower TBI dose (less than 990 cGy) was the most significant factor associated with relapse and the second most important factor associated with recurrence of leukaemia was the absence of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD). Actuarial relapse incidence was 62%. 28% and 18% for patients with no, limited or extensive chronic GvHD respectively. However, chronic GVHD had no significant impact on survival. Combined stratification for TBI dose and cGvHD showed that the dose effect of TBI on relapse was evident both in patients with and without cGvHD. Chronic GvHD influenced the risk of relapse only in patients receiving less than 990 cGy. These results suggest that a higher dose of TBI, within this schedule, produced long-term disease-free survival in the majority of AMLs and CMLs.

Recurrent chromosome deletions of 17p-, 9q- and 2p- were also found as secondary aberrations in association with tumor development. Accumulation of the data from variant translocation for the 9 ; 22, 8 ; 21 and 15 ; 17 gave us important informations of critical sites of the chromosome in leukemia development. A new trial for the simultaneous analysis of morphology, immunologic phenotype and karyotype on the same metaphase clearly demonstrated stem cell origin of leukemia in some cases, specializing the affected cell lineage. Progress in non-radioactive in situ hybridization techniques now allows approaches to the recognition of particular chromosome abnormality in metaphase and also in interphase cell by means of specific repetitive probes for each chromosome. Though a hypothesis that fragile sites may act as factors predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements have attracted attention in past few years, recent results appear to be conflicting without any direct proof. Cytogenetic studies in solid tumor have been remarkably progressed with advances of methodology. Recurrent chromosome aberrations in solid tumor were found, such as t (X ; 18) in synovial sarcoma, t (12 ; 16) in liposarcoma, and i (12p) in seminoma.

Results of immunologic typing correlate well with the other clinical and biological data. For prognostic purposes, several patterns can be identified. Among B line ALLs, four varieties have been differentiated, i.e., CD10 negative ALLs, common ALLs, pre-B ALLs, and B ALLs. T ALLs include a broad spectrum of heterogeneous proliferations whose immunologic classification is made difficult by the large number of phenotypes encountered.

The effect of BE is partially reversible over 12-24 hours with the level of RNA synthesis returning nearly to control levels during this time period.

The level of gene-specific mRNA for the c-Ha-ras, c-fms, and c-mos genes in these cells also remained constant during exposure to BE. Ribosomal RNA is not degraded during 24 hours of BE treatment in vitro, suggesting that BE does not maintain the relative mRNA level for these genes by selective degradation of other RNA species.

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) the breakage within the phl gene is largely confined to a 5.8-kb segment referred to as the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). To determine whether the presence of specific bcr exons on the Philadelphia chromosome has any clinical significance, we have analyzed the bcr breakpoints in 134 patients with CML. As many as five probes were used in this analysis, including a synthetic oligonucleotide probe homologous to the bcr exon 3 (phl exon 14) region. The distribution of breakpoints indicates that, in fact, breakage is largely confined to a 3.1-kb segment lying between bcr exon 2 and exon 4 (phl exons 13-15). In 61 CML patients analyzed within 1 year of diagnosis, the distribution of breakpoints appeared to be random within the 3.1-kb region. However, a significant excess of 5' breakpoints was observed in the total population studied, consistent with previous data showing that patients with 3' breakpoints have shorter disease durations. Analysis using the bcr exon 3 sequence probe indicated it was probably the presence or absence of bcr exon 3 on the Philadelphia chromosome that accounts for some of the variability in disease duration seen in CML. The data suggest that the phl/abl protein product may influence the timing of the onset of blast crisis and imply a continuing role for this protein during the evolution of the disease.","['Grossman, A', 'Silver, R T', 'Arlin, Z', 'Coleman, M', 'Camposano, E', 'Gascon, P', 'Benn, P A']","['Grossman A', 'Silver RT', 'Arlin Z', 'Coleman M', 'Camposano E', 'Gascon P', 'Benn PA']","['Lifecodes Corporation, Valhalla, NY 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/physiopathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Restriction Mapping']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1989 Nov;45(5):729-38.,,,PMC1683428,,,,,,,,,

There are at least two forms of the cellular receptors for IL-2, one with a very high affinity and the other with a lower affinity. Two IL-2 binding peptides, a 55-kd peptide reactive with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody and a 75-kd, non-Tac IL-2-binding peptide, were identified. A multichain model for the high-affinity receptor in which an independently existing p55 or p75 peptide would represent low-or intermediate-affinity receptors, respectively, and high-affinity receptors would be expressed when both of these receptors are expressed and associated in a receptor complex, is proposed. An additional 95 - to 105-kd peptide may also participate in the multisubunit, high-affinity form of the IL-2 receptor. The p75 peptide is receptor for IL-2 on large granular lymphocytes and is sufficient for the IL-2 activation of these cells. In contrast to resting T cells, the T cells of patients with certain neoplasias of mononuclear cells and of patients with select autoimmune disorders, as well as T cells participating in organ allograft rejections, express the Tac antigen. To exploit the fact that IL-2 receptors are present on abnormally activated T cells but no on normal resting T cells, clinical trials have been initiated involving patients with neoplastic or autoimmune disorders as well as those receiving organ allografts.

Each two cis-acting sequences seem to be involved in these regulations: HTLV-1 rex depends on a splice donor (SD) and a responsible element (RXE) at the 3' end, whereas HIV rev depends on a specific repressive sequence (CRS) and a responsible element (RRE) in the intron, but does not require an SD. For analyses of these cis-acting sequences, we inserted an HIV element RRE into an HTLV-1 construct and tested the responses to HTLV-1 rex and HIV rev regulations. The results indicated that both rex and rev could regulate RNA expression of these chimeric constructs responding to an HIV RRE. A repressive element (CRS) was dispensable, and the intronic or exonic location of RRE was not important.

The location of human proto-oncogenes at the sites of chromosome breaks and/or translocations in cells from some patients with leukemia or lymphoma is a striking observation. These data stimulated research into the mechanism of activation of specific oncogenes that change the biology of human hematopoietic cells. Recent investigations have focused upon several areas that might alter cell biology including: 1) translocation and/or inversion of chromosome fragments containing a proto-oncogene to a location where other gene sequences can stimulate oncogene activation, 2) replication of copy number of proto-oncogenes or increased transcriptional activity and 3) point mutation in proto-oncogenes leading to a structurally altered protein. The third area of research has recently received significant attention with respect to the potential role of three ras genes (c-Harvey-ras, c-Kirsten-ras and N-ras) in human leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. Recent studies have proposed a model for leukemogenic transformation of human hematopoietic cells by the product of a mutated ras oncogene. Mutations at codons 12, 13 or 61 of the first exon of its 4.7 Kb of DNA (for c-Ha-ras) have been described. Other data revealing an absence of such mutations in the ras genes of many human leukemias and the absence of detectable transcription of ras genes in many alkylating agent-associated cases of AML, suggest that while ras mutations may be involved in some settings, there are probably multiple genetic pathways to leukemogenic transformation of human hematopoietic cells.","['Greenberger, J S']",['Greenberger JS'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530070603 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1989 Nov;7(6):343-59. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530070603.,,,,,,,,,,136,,

The expression of human high molecular weight B cell growth factor (HMW-BCGF) receptors (R) on clonal populations of leukemic B cells in CLL was studied by ligand binding assays using 125I-labeled HMW-BCGF as well as by immunofluorescence/flow cytometry and Scatchard analyses using an anti-HMW-BCGF R monoclonal antibody (MAb), designated BA-5. There was a high correlation between HMW-BCGF R expression and responsiveness to HMW-BCGF. 60% of CLL cases constitutively expressed HMW-BCGF R and showed a marked proliferative response to HMW-BCGF in [3H]TdR incorporation assays as well as colony assays. Similarly, HCL cells, PLL cells, and activated normal B cells expressed functional HMW-BCGF R, as determined by ligand binding assays using 125I-HMW-BCGF, [3H]TdR incorporation assays, and reactivity with BA-5 MAb. Scatchard analyses indicated the existence of approximately 3,000 HMW-BCGF R/cell on HMW-BCGF responsive CLL cells with an apparent Ka value of 4.6 X 10(7) M-1. The concentrations of HMW-BCGF required for maximum stimulation of CLL cells were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those needed for half maximal receptor occupancy, indicating that only a small fraction of HMW-BCGF R need to be occupied to stimulate leukemic CLL B cells. Crosslinking of surface bound 125I-HMW-BCGF (60 kD) with the bivalent crosslinker DTSSP to its binding site on fresh CLL cells identified a 150-kD HMW-BCGF/HMW-BCGF R complex, suggesting an apparent molecular weight of 90 kD for the receptor protein. The growth stimulatory effects of HMW-BCGF on clonogenic CLL cells did not depend on accessory cells or costimulant factors. The anti-HMW-BCGF R monoclonal antibody BA-5 disrupted HMW-BCGF/HMW-BCGF R interactions at the level of clonogenic CLL cells and inhibited HMW-BCGF-stimulated CLL colony formation in vitro.

(i) They can provide information on the oncogenic potential of genes as a function of tissue context. (ii) They allow the analysis of the primary effects of an oncogene on proliferation and differentiation before secondary mutations have occurred. (iii) Crossings between transgenic mice carrying different oncogenes can reveal their capacity to cooperate in transformation. (iv) Transgenic mice bearing a particular oncogene can be used to search for (new) (anti)oncogenes that synergize with the transgene. The non-acute transforming murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) appear very useful for this purpose. This has become clear from our studies with pim-I and c-myc transgenic mice. MuLV dramatically accelerates T-cell lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing the pim-I oncogene in their lymphoid compartment. In all tumors induced by MuLV in pim-I transgenic mice, either the c-myc or the N-myc gene was activated by proviral insertion. Similarly, MuLV infection of transgenic mice overexpressing the c-myc gene in their B-cell compartment resulted in the acceleration of pre-B-cell lymphomagenesis. A significant fraction of the resulting pre-B-cell tumors showed proviral activation of pim-I. This shows that pim-I and myc synergize efficiently in both B- and T-cell lymphomagenesis. pim-I transgenic mice are also highly sensitive to tumor induction by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and therefore represent an excellent in vivo model system to test the oncogenic potential of chemical compounds.","['Berns, A', 'Breuer, M', 'Verbeek, S', 'van Lohuizen, M']","['Berns A', 'Breuer M', 'Verbeek S', 'van Lohuizen M']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

Induced lung tumours are inherited, as they are dominant mutations, indicating that germ line mutation causes cancer in progeny. This finding is now confirmed in three different strains of mice (ICR, LT, and N5). Most of the tumours induced in offspring were transplantable (malignant); furthermore, preliminary experiments reveal involvement of some known and novel oncogenes in these tumours. A germ line mutation causing a tumour ('tumour mutation') is weakly carcinogenic by itself, but it is strongly expressed in the progeny after postnatal treatment with a small dose of the carcinogenesis promoting agent urethane. Tumour yields induced by chemical carcinogens were 20-250 times higher than those induced by tumour mutation alone. Embryonic mutagenesis also causes cancer in offspring. Although radiation in utero at early embryonic stages induces significant yields of somatic mutations, radiation is not or very weakly carcinogenic. However, it induced persistent hypersensitivity to postnatally administered carcinogenic (urethane) and promoting (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate) agents. The mechanism must be similar to that of germ line mutation in causing tumours. No leukaemia was found in these experiments as in atomic bomb survivors exposed in utero, but all induced tumours were of adult types. The results predicted the recent epidemiological finding that the incidence of adult cancers is now increasing dramatically among atomic bomb survivors exposed in utero.","['Nomura, T']",['Nomura T'],"['Department of Radiation Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/radiation effects', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1989;(96):375-87.,,,,,,,,,,40,,

Recent findings suggest that the hormonal environment during early gestation can result not only in the development of clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina but also in the development of germ cell tumours of the testes and ovary. Hormone-related risk factors for testicular germ cell neoplasms include maternal use of exogenous oestrogens during early gestation and, possibly, maternal nausea, maternal obesity and race as well. Ovarian germ cell tumours also appear to be related to maternal use of hormones and obesity. Several epidemiological studies of cancer in young people have been directed towards suggested associations with parental occupational exposures, parental cigarette smoking and household exposures to electric and magnetic fields (EMF). The findings of the many studies of parental occupational exposures are inconsistent and are often nonspecific with respect to the type of childhood cancer and the job exposure implicated. Parental cigarette smoking has been associated in some studies with an increased risk for cancer among children and young adults, and in other studies with an increased risk among mature adults, but the findings are not consistent across studies. Three studies of all types of childhood cancer found risk to be related to household exposures to EMF; in all three, the risk for central nervous system tumours was increased, and in two of the three leukaemia risk as well. A fourth study showed no association between childhood leukaemia and EMF. A hypothesis is proposed which suggests that prenatal and early childhood exposure to N-nitroso compounds (NOC) may be related to the development of primary tumours of the brain in children. Experimentalists have shown that various NOC are potent nervous system carcinogens, particularly when animals are exposed transplacentally. This experimental model and findings from a Los Angeles case-control study (209 pairs) of brain tumours in young people led to the proposed epidemiological hypothesis. Although this and other epidemiological studies of NOC have major limitations, findings from epidemiological studies of congenital defects and of other childhood cancers lend the hypothesis some support. A large international collaborative case-control study of childhood brain tumours was begun recently. This study has a major advantage over most case-control studies in adults because the exposure period of greatest interest (gestation) is clearly defined.","['Preston-Martin, S']",['Preston-Martin S'],"['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,['0 (Nitroso Compounds)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/genetics', 'Nitroso Compounds/toxicity', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1989;(96):289-314.,,,,,,,,,,145,,

IFSLL is characterized morphologically by variable numbers and sizes of prolymphocytes (nuclei showing one centrally located prominent nucleolus) in the PFs and by small round lymphocytes in the IF region. The lymph nodes in our cases had multiple RFs (100%) and patent or partially patent sinuses (72%), with moderate expansion of the IF region (48%) and typically absent or minimal perinodal infiltration (48%). In 48% of the cases, the PFs surrounded the RFs, producing a pseudo-mantle zone pattern. Immunologic study showed the medium and large prolymphocytes to be mildly LN 1- and LN 2-positive, whereas the small prolymphocytes and lymphocytes were LN 1-negative and moderately LN 2-positive. Few cells in the IF region stained with UCHL-1 antibody. These data indicate the marked preponderance of the non-follicular center cell type of B cells in the IF areas. In all 11 cases tested, a monoclonal B cell population was found. The mean age of the patients was 62 years, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.7. B symptoms were present in 20% of the patients. Nineteen percent of the patients had clinical stage I or II disease, whereas 81% had stage IV disease. The median absolute lymphocyte count was 3,239 X 10(6), with a range of 767 to 13,770 X 10(6) cells/L. In six cases, the lymphocyte count was above 4,000 X 10(6), and in no case was it more than 15,000 X 10(6). It was difficult to distinguish these cases of IFSLL from lymphadenitis and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas because it was difficult to recognize the subtle PF pattern in the presence of a partially preserved lymph node architecture. Because of the partially retained lymph node architecture and the expansion of the IF region by PFs, this lymphoma is thought to originate from the IF small B lymphocytes, which displayed an in situ growth pattern. Moreover, because of the predominant disease in the lymph nodes and the similarity of features in PFs and follicles, we conclude that IFSLL is a disease that is primary to the lymph nodes. IFSLL should be distinguished from mantle zone lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Ellison, D J', 'Nathwani, B N', 'Cho, S Y', 'Martin, S E']","['Ellison DJ', 'Nathwani BN', 'Cho SY', 'Martin SE']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Stem Cells/pathology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0046-8177(89)90231-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(89)90231-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1989 Nov;20(11):1108-18. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(89)90231-1.,,,,,,,,,,17,,

Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were generated using splenocytes of DEAU-tumor bearing mice. Before the fusion experiments, cellular immunity of the mice bearing growing DEAU tumors was restored by injection of spleen cells from conventional Balb/C mice. Spleen cells from conventional Balb/C mice immunized with DEAU-cell line were also used for the generation of MoAbs. Four MoAbs (DBB.42 and DBA.44 from normal Balb/C mice, and DNA.7 and DND.53 from athymic nude mice) were investigated because they identified B-cell-associated antigens not destroyed by fixatives. DBB.42 recognized a pan-B cell-associated antigen (molecular weight (mol wt) = 45 Kd). DBA.44 detected a B-cell antigen (mol wt not determined) expressed on a subpopulation of B lymphocytes in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles. DNA.7 also defined a B-cell antigen (43 Kd) mainly expressed on germinal center cells. Similarly, DND.53 recognized a B-cell antigen (two bands of mol wt 20 Kd and 35 Kd, respectively) mainly expressed on germinal center cells and mantle zone lymphocytes and interdigitating reticulum cells in the paracortical area. Major differences were found in the reactivities of these MoAbs on malignant lymphomas. DBB.42 was positive with almost all B-cell lymphomas and some T-cell lymphomas. Within the group of low-grade B-cell lymphomas, DBA.44 reacted principally with hairy-cell leukemia. DNA.7 reacted mainly with high-grade B-cell lymphomas with a weak positivity in low-grade B-cell lymphomas. DND.53 reacted with all but one B-cell lymphoma, cells of histiocytosis X, and Reed-Sternberg cells. These findings indicate that new MoAbs can be generated by using spleen cells from athymic mice bearing human tumors as well as by new lymphoid cell lines. The MoAbs so generated, as in the present study, are deemed potentially useful for the recognition of B-cell lymphomas in routine diagnostic histopathology. In addition, DND.53 could be of value for the diagnosis of histiocytosis X and the detection of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease.","['al Saati, T', 'Caspar, S', 'Brousset, P', 'Chittal, S', 'Caveriviere, P', 'Hounieu, H', 'Dastugue, N', 'Idoipe, J B', 'Icart, J', 'Mazerolles, C']","['al Saati T', 'Caspar S', 'Brousset P', 'Chittal S', 'Caveriviere P', 'Hounieu H', 'Dastugue N', 'Idoipe JB', 'Icart J', 'Mazerolles C', 'et al.']","[""Laboratoire d'Anatomie Pathologique CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '8002-74-2 (Paraffin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Paraffin', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82857-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2476-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the adult disease, growth of hematopoietic progenitors from peripheral blood (PB) occurs in the absence of exogenous stimulus even at low cell densities. This so-called ""spontaneous"" growth can be abrogated by adherent cell depletion and appears to depend on production of endogenous growth factors. We studied seven children with JCML to determine the nature of endogenous stimulators. With isolated PB mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and a 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation assay, JCML cells were shown to incorporate high levels of 3H-TdR when cultured in the absence of stimulus even at low cell densities. When neutralizing antisera prepared against each of the four known colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, and interleukin-3 (IL-3), as well as antisera against interleukin-1 (alpha and beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were added to these cultures, only the antisera against recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) consistently resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, achieving up to 72% inhibition of 3H-TdR incorporation in one case. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against rhGM-CSF resulted in a similar and highly significant degree of inhibition. A marked inhibitory effect of rhGM-CSF antiserum on ""spontaneous"" growth of PB CFU-GM derived colonies in semisolid medium was also demonstrated in four of five patients studied (87% to 90% inhibition). Production of growth factors by highly enriched JCML monocytes was variable. When initially studied in five of the seven patients, the monocytes from three of the patients revealed increased release of IL-1-like activities; two patients had levels similar to those of controls. One patient with normal levels when initially studied was later shown to have markedly increased amounts of IL-1-like activities in a second preparation of monocyte-conditioned medium (MCM). High levels of GM-CSF were detected in the initial MCM from one patient, but this may have indirectly reflected elevated IL-1-like activities present in the MCM. IL-3 and M-CSF levels were either low or undetectable in the patients studied as compared with MCM prepared with normal adult monocytes. These results clearly implicate GM-CSF as the primary endogenous regulator of JCML cell proliferation in culture and suggest that this malignant myeloproliferative disease may in part result from paracrine stimulation of marrow progenitor cells by growth factors/cytokines secreted by the malignant monocytes.","['Gualtieri, R J', 'Emanuel, P D', 'Zuckerman, K S', 'Martin, G', 'Clark, S C', 'Shadduck, R K', 'Dracker, R A', 'Akabutu, J', 'Nitschke, R', 'Hetherington, M L']","['Gualtieri RJ', 'Emanuel PD', 'Zuckerman KS', 'Martin G', 'Clark SC', 'Shadduck RK', 'Dracker RA', 'Akabutu J', 'Nitschke R', 'Hetherington ML', 'et al.']","[""Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*physiopathology']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82841-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2360-7.,"['CA 15237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK07488/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-2 receptor, was conjugated to liposomes and compared with anti-transferrin receptor (anti-TFR) conjugates for specific binding, internalization, and intracellular drug delivery to ATL cells. Two independent assays were used: a fluorimetric assay with liposome encapsulated 1-hydroxypyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid, a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, and a growth inhibition assay using methotrexate-gamma-aspartate, a liposome-dependent cytotoxic drug. MT-1 and HUT-102 cell lines derived from patients with ATL were compared with Molt-4, a leukemia cell line that does not express IL-2 receptors in an uninduced state. Fluorimetric studies showed specific binding and internalization of anti-Tac-conjugated liposomes by HUT-102 and MT-1 but not by the Tac-negative cell line Molt-4, demonstrating the lack of nonspecific or Fc receptor-mediated uptake. Anti-TFR-conjugated liposomes were effectively bound and internalized by all three cell lines and consistently showed the highest degree of cellular liposome uptake. Drug-containing liposomes conjugated to anti-Tac were more than tenfold more effective in causing growth inhibition of ATL cells than the nonspecific control conjugates. Anti-Tac conjugates caused minimal growth inhibition of Molt-4 cells over the concentration range effective against the ATL cells. Anti-TFR-coupled liposomes gave better growth inhibition of HUT-102 and MT-1 cells (40- to 60-fold) than anti-Tac conjugates. Both anti-Tac-directed and anti-TFR-directed liposomes are effective for intracellular drug delivery to ATL cells and may represent a useful method of treatment in this disease.","['Hege, K M', 'Daleke, D L', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Matthay, K K']","['Hege KM', 'Daleke DL', 'Waldmann TA', 'Matthay KK']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Endocytosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84984-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):2043-52.,['CA39448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The production of both of these stromal cell products induced by cytokine mediators appears to be closely linked. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is an intracellular second messenger that inhibits myeloid cell proliferation and is produced in myeloid leukemia cells on stimulation of adenylate cyclase enzyme by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Cells expressing the product of an RAS oncogene have been observed to display diminished hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase of membranes. If this observation were applicable to myeloid cells, a potentially important mode for leukemia cells expressing p21 RAS to escape inhibitory regulation within the hematopoietic microenvironment would be identified. We studied an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid cell line, NFS/N1.H7, and a derivative line transfected with H-RAS codon 12 (T24) oncogene, H7 Neo Ras.F3, for inhibition of proliferation by PGE1, 1 microM, alone or in combination with pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gi, an inhibitory regulatory guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein of adenylate cyclase. NFS/N1.H7 cells were inhibited in interleukin-3-dependent proliferation (dose range, IL-3 10 to 100 U/mL) by PGE1 79 +/- 11%, by pertussis toxin 51 +/- 9%, and by the combination 92 +/- 2%, whereas H7 Neo RAS.F3 was inhibited 51 +/- 7%, 6 +/- 2%, or 58 +/- 9% by PGE1, pertussis toxin, and the combination, respectively. These differences in capacity for inhibition by adenylate cyclase agonists between RAS-transfectant cells (lower inhibition) versus parent cells (greater inhibition) were all highly significant (P less than .0005). Intracellular cAMP formed on PGE1 stimulation of pertussis-intoxicated cells was 150% lower in RAS-transfectant cells than in parent cells. The adenylate cyclase activity of membranes from pertussis-intoxicated RAS-transfected cells was 1.5 to two times lower than that of pertussis-intoxicated parent-cell membranes on Mg2+-dependent activation by hormone and/or guanine nucleotide. However, very similar adenylate cyclase activity was observed in oncogenic p21 RAS-containing membranes compared with parental membranes under conditions of direct activation by 4 mM Mn2+ and forskolin, where inhibitory or stimulatory G-protein influences are minimal. These studies showed diminished adenylate cyclase activity in mutant RAS-bearing myeloid-cell membranes compared with parent-cell membranes independent of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Derigs, H G', 'Klingberg, D', 'Tricot, G J', 'Boswell, H S']","['Derigs HG', 'Klingberg D', 'Tricot GJ', 'Boswell HS']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', '*Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/*physiology', 'Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', '*Genes, ras', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84969-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):1942-51.,['R01 CA45571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Repeated cycles of denaturation, primer annealling and extension carried out with the heat stable enzyme, Taq polymerase, leads to exponential increases in the target DNA sequences. The technique has been widely applied in immunology to define HLA polymorphism, T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin diversity, pathogen detection, quantification of lymphokines and lymphoma or leukaemia detection. In addition, it has been very widely applied in all areas of molecular biology and human genetics. Because of its simplicity and sensitivity, PCR represents a major technical development for molecular biologists and will continue to have a great impact on molecular immunology.

More than 40 frustrating years were to elapse before this early work with chickens was to lead to experiments with mice, made possible by the use of inbred strains and catalyzed by the observations of Dalldorf and of Gross that newborn animals were susceptible targets for pathogenesis by, respectively, Coxsackie viruses, and polyoma and retroviruses. Seminal observations by Charlotte Friend that retroviruses caused neoplasia in adult mice and her studies investigating the properties and pathogenesis of the Friend leukemia virus, as well as the role of the host immune response in development of disease, helped lay the groundwork of modern retrovirology. The use of retroviruses to study cell differentiation became the foundation on which many more recent discoveries rest. Above all, the information supplied by Friend and her colleagues and investigators in other laboratories finally enabled unequivocal isolation of the first human retroviruses long after most investigators had given up hope of finding such agents in man. Moreover, the techniques developed and the rapid characterization of these newly discovered human pathogens enabled the isolation of human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is a challenge to current investigators to extend and expand upon the original work of Friend concerning the pathogenesis of retroviruses, as only a fuller understanding of the complex virus-host disease patterns induced by these viruses will ultimately lead to their control and prevention.","['Rapp, F']",['Rapp F'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey 17033.']",['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['Genetics/history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'United States', 'Virology/history']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16502.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1989;567:349-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16502.x.,,,,,,,,,,,['Friend C'],"['Friend, C']"

Gene cloning has shown that there is a family of different genes for these proteins. Normal protein regulators of hematopoiesis can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation to mature non-dividing cells, and there are different pathways of inducing differentiation. Results from studies on the molecular control of growth and differentiation in normal myeloid hematopoietic cells, on changes in the normal developmental program, and on the suppression of malignancy in myeloid leukemia have shown that (a) malignancy can be suppressed by inducing differentiation either with or without genetic changes in the malignant cells, (b) this suppression of malignancy does not have to restore all the normal controls, and (c) genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy, which include changes in homeobox genes, can be bypassed and their effects nullified by inducing differentiation that stops cells from multiplying.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],"['Department of Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Models, Biological', 'Reference Values']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16466.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1989;567:141-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16466.x.,,,,,,,,,,48,,

Based on the immunochemical analysis it was demonstrated that PKC I was encoded by gamma cDNA, PKC II by the alternatively spliced beta I and beta II cDNAs, and PKC III by alpha cDNA. The expression of these enzymes appears to be tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. The central nervous system expresses high level of all three isozymes and the peripheral tissues mainly PKC II and III. During brain development, the expression of PKC I appears to follow the progress of synaptogenesis, whereas PKC II and III increase progressively from fetus up to 2-3 weeks of age. The level of PKC I in adult brain is highest in the cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral cortex especially in those cortical regions being important for visual information processing and storage. The role of PKC II and III in cellular regulation was investigated by treatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This phorbol ester caused a faster degradation of PKC II than III, indicating a differential down-regulation of these two enzymes by this compound. The results presented in this study support the contention that each species of PKC has a distinct function in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes.","['Huang, K P', 'Huang, F L', 'Nakabayashi, H', 'Yoshida, Y']","['Huang KP', 'Huang FL', 'Nakabayashi H', 'Yoshida Y']","['Section on Metabolic Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Endocrinol (Copenh),Acta endocrinologica,0370312,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/acta.0.1210307 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Endocrinol (Copenh). 1989 Sep;121(3):307-16. doi: 10.1530/acta.0.1210307.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basins were divided following three categories of exposure (low, intermediate, high) on the basis of the level of pesticides sales. Results at the scale of the three categories show that among women living in rural farm areas, the relative risk (RR) for cancers of the lymphatic tissues is of 1.62 when highly exposed basins were compared to low exposed basins (95% Confidence Interval = 1.16; 2.25), and of 1.63 (95% CI = 1.08; 2.45) when they were compared to basins with intermediate exposure. For women of 35-64 age group, RR values are respectively of 3.15 (95% CI = 1.67; 5.93) in the first case, and 3.73 (95% CI = 1.54; 9.01) in the second case. By another way, at the level of the 34 drainage basins, correlation analysis have shown statistically significant positive associations between several variables representing pesticides utilization in agriculture and geographic variations of some cancers, according to sex and age groups, especially for the following: men, cancer of the brain (1-14 and 15-34 age groups), cancers of the lymphatic tissues (34-64) and leukaemia (1-14); for women, cancer of the brain (35-64), the lymphatic tissues (35-64, 65 and more, all ages) and leukaemia (15-34, 35-64, 65 and more and all ages). After that, principal components analysis has been performed using variables representing pesticides utilization and socio-economic status by basin. Height factors have been produced, including two socio-economic and six pesticides-factors. Factor scores have been introduced in multiple regression analysis to see the role of each factor in the explanation of spatial distribution of those cancers who had been identified in the correlation analysis before. Results have shown that in most of the cases, only pesticides-factors have significant relationship with those cancers. Socio-economic factors play a significant role only for the following cancers: men, lymphatic tissues, 65 years old and more; women, cancer of the brain all ages, leukaemia 1-14 and 65 years old and more.

The information presently available, derived from small, retrospective series or case reports, indicates that leukemia may develop throughout pregnancy, that a leukemia woman who is pregnant need not undergo an abortion if she does not desire, and that standard antileukemic chemotherapy can be administered safely during the second and third trimesters. The antifolates (eg, methotrexate), being particularly teratogenic, should be avoided during the first trimester. Cytarabine and anthracycline treatment, the fundamental components of management for patients with AML, has not been associated with birth defects. The risk for placental injury, sepsis, and spontaneous abortion or premature birth is undoubtedly increased in women who experience the periodic episodes of myelosuppression that accompany leukemia treatment. Once remission has been achieved, decisions regarding adjustments of the intensity of therapy must be made with each individual patient; such dose alterations may diminish the mother's potential for long-term leukemia control, while possibly securing the viability of the fetus. Similarly, issues such as elective delivery prior to term and vaginal delivery v caesarean section should be resolved on a patient-by-patient basis.

Using the mobility-shift assay, we show a direct correlation between the extent of sequence-specific protein binding to intron 1 DNA fragments, and c-myb mRNA levels in different cell types. During dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of mouse erythroleukemic cells, there was a dramatic decrease in these nuclear factors that correlated with the decrease in the levels of c-myb mRNA.

The Rex protein acts by promoting the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced viral messenger RNAs that encode the virion structural proteins. To identify the biologically important peptide domains within Rex, we introduced a series of mutations throughout its sequence. Two distinct classes of mutations lacking Rex biological activity were identified. One class corresponds to trans-dominant repressors as they inhibit the function of the wild-type Rex protein. The second class of mutants, in contrast, are recessive negative, rather than dominant negative, as they are not appropriately targeted to the cell nucleus. These results indicate the presence of at least two functionally distinct domains within the Rex protein, one involved in protein localization and a second involved in effector function.

WM-65 reacted with a wide range of acute and chronic leukaemias of both myeloid and lymphoid types, and with corresponding cell lines, but did not react with non-haemopoietic cells. By immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, WM-65 identifies a heavily glycosylated surface protein of molecular weight between 40 and 50 kD.

A 34-year-old male was admitted in July, 1986 with a diagnosis of AML (M2). Two courses of BHAC-DMP regimen induced complete remission in October, while marked pyrexia resistant to antibiotics remained. An ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple liver and spleen abscesses suspected of mycotic etiology. Administration of amphotericin B (AMPH-B) by intravenous injection was difficult owing to its severe side effect. Multiple abscesses increased in the size and number despite treatment with Miconazole (MCZ) and Ketoconazole. Exploratory laparotomy was performed with splenectomy, and splenic specimens were found to contain Candida organisms. Soon AMPH-B was administered through a catheter inserted into the portal vein at the same time. A side effect by AMPH-B was tolerable and his fever resolved to normal in 2 weeks after institution of this therapy, and the sizes of abscesses were markedly reduced. The patient remained in remission through 23 months, free of fungal infection. Case 2. A 23-year-old female was admitted for relapse of ALL (L2), in April, 1987. Reinduction therapy with BHAC-L-AVP achieved again in May but fever unresponsive to antibiotics occurred. Since multiple liver-spleen abscesses were showed by US and CT suspected mycotic etiology, antimycotic therapy with Miconazole and AMPH-B was performed but clinical findings were deteriorated. AMPH-B was administered through a catheter inserted into the hepatic artery for two weeks, following into the splenic artery for a week. Splenic abscesses were resolved in a week and liver abscesses were markedly reduced at three weeks after initiation of intra-arterial antifungal treatment. Through the analysis of these case studies we confirmed the usefulness of intraportal and intrahepatosplenic arterial administration of AMPH-B.","['Chujo, T', 'Kuratsune, H', 'Nishimori, Y', 'Machii, T', 'Kitani, T', 'Kimoto, Y', 'Hashimoto, T', 'Nakamura, H', 'Aozasa, K']","['Chujo T', 'Kuratsune H', 'Nishimori Y', 'Machii T', 'Kitani T', 'Kimoto Y', 'Hashimoto T', 'Nakamura H', 'Aozasa K']",,['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Abscess/complications/*drug therapy', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Catheters, Indwelling', 'Female', 'Hepatic Artery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Liver Abscess/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/complications/*drug therapy', 'Portal Vein', 'Splenic Artery', 'Splenic Diseases/complications/*drug therapy']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 May;30(5):736-45.,,,,,,,,,,27,,

To compare the reactivity with human antibodies of different regions of this gp61 protein, five plasmids (A, B, B1, C, and D) were constructed to express recombinant proteins (RPs) in Escherichia coli. RP-A, RP-B, RP-B1, and RP-C contain amino acid residues 26 to 165, 166 to 229, 166 to 201, and 229 to 308, respectively, of the exterior envelope protein gp46. Serum samples from HTLV-1-seropositive subjects were assayed for reactivity with these RPs by Western immunoblotting. The percentages of positive reactivity with each of the RPs were as follows: 18.9% (23 of 122) for RP-A, 89.6% (112 of 125) for RP-B, 70.2% (85 of 121) for RP-B1, and 92.9% (117 of 126) for RP-C. These results indicate that the C-terminal half of gp46 (RP-B plus RP-C) can detect 97.6% (123 of 126) of positive samples, while the N-terminal half of gp46 (RP-A) can only detect 18.9% of the HTLV-1-positive sera (P less than 0.005). Furthermore, RP-A, -B, and -C, which together span the entire length of gp46 except the first five amino acids at the N terminus and the last four amino acids at the C- terminus, detected 99.2% (125 of 126) of the HTLV-1-positive subjects. In contrast, RP-D, which contains the HTLV-1 transmembrane envelope protein gp21 minus the first amino acid at the N terminus, had a lower rate of antibody reactivity at 73.7% (84 of 114) (P less than 0.005). The difference in seropositive rates for RP-D between HTLV-1 carriers (55.6%) and adult T-cell leukemia patients (85.5%) is statistically significant (P less than 0.01). This study therefore indicates that the C-terminal half of gp46, especially the amino acid sequence from 200 to 308, contains the most reactive epitopes of the HTLV-1 gp61 envelope glycoprotein.","['Chen, Y M', 'Lee, T H', 'Samuel, K P', 'Okayama, A', 'Tachibana, N', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Papas, T S', 'Essex, M']","['Chen YM', 'Lee TH', 'Samuel KP', 'Okayama A', 'Tachibana N', 'Miyoshi I', 'Papas TS', 'Essex M']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.11.4952-4957.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Nov;63(11):4952-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.11.4952-4957.1989.,"['1ROI CA 38450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'I-P50-HL-33774/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC251144,,,,,,,,,

The cleavage reaction, which is mediated by a host protease, occurs at a sequence highly conserved in retroviral envelope glycoprotein precursors. We have investigated the sequence requirements for this cleavage reaction by introducing four single-amino-acid changes into the glutamic acid-lysine-arginine sequence immediately amino terminal to the site of cleavage. We have also examined the effects of these mutations on the syncytium formation induced by HIV envelope glycoproteins. Our results indicate that a glutamic acid to glycine change at gp120 amino acid 516, a lysine to isoleucine change at amino acid 517, and an arginine to lysine change at amino acid 518 affect neither gp160 cleavage nor syncytium formation. The results obtained with the arginine to lysine change at amino acid 518 differ significantly from the results obtained with the same mutation at the envelope precursor cleavage site of a murine leukemia virus (E. O. Freed, and R. Risser, J. Virol. 61:2852-2856, 1987). An arginine to threonine mutation at gp120 amino acid 518, the terminal residue of gp120, abolishes both gp160 cleavage and syncytium formation. These findings demonstrate that despite its highly conserved nature, the basic pair of amino acids at the site of gp160 cleavage is not absolutely required for proper envelope glycoprotein processing. This report also supports the idea that cleavage of gp160 is required for activation of the HIV envelope fusion function.","['Freed, E O', 'Myers, D J', 'Risser, R']","['Freed EO', 'Myers DJ', 'Risser R']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/analysis/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells/cytology', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Transfection', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.63.11.4670-4675.1989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Nov;63(11):4670-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.11.4670-4675.1989.,"['CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC251101,,,,,,,,,

In some contexts, regulation of the virion proteins is achieved by p27rex-dependent accumulation of unspliced or singly spliced mRNAs that specify capsid or envelope proteins.

In the bone marrow, these processes are controlled by growth factors and by cell to cell interactions, the latter being specially important for the regulation of the stem-cell population. In the study of long-term hematopoietic damage, we have to distinguish between deleterious effects of the environmental toxins on the stem and progenitor cells, and on the stromal bone marrow cells which are part of the regulatory hematopoietic microenvironment. In some experimental situations, the function of the tissue may be subnormal, not because of stem cell damage (which may also be present), but because of damage to regulatory environmental populations. Because of the high degree of organization of the hematopoietic tissue (not immediately obvious from histological sections), the heterogeneity of the stromal cell populations, and their different capacities to regenerate after cytotoxic insult, the stromal damage is likely to be heterogeneous and would tend to be expressed functionally at later times than acute hematopoietic injury. While microenvironmental damage may be of importance in the induction of hematopoietic failure, the primary target in leukemogenesis is likely to be the stem cell. However, experimental data support the concept that regulatory microenvironmental influences may hinder or favor the development of leukemia.","['Testa, N G', 'Dexter, T M']","['Testa NG', 'Dexter TM']","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital, Withington, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Hazardous Substances)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hazardous Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.898251 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Jul;82:51-6. doi: 10.1289/ehp.898251.,,,PMC1568120,,,,,,,43,,

Comparisons across studies show that only acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is found to be consistently in excess with significant benzene exposure. The data from the Pliofilm study that forms the basis of most quantitative assessments reveal that all the AML cases came from only one of the three studied plants and that all the benzene exposure data came from the other plants. Hematological data from the 1940s from the plant from which almost all of the industrial hygiene exposure data come do not correlate well with the originally published exposure estimates but do correlate well with an alternative set of exposure estimates that are much greater than those estimates originally published. Temporal relationships within the study are not consistent with those of other studies. The dose-response relationship is strongly nonlinear. Other data suggest that the leukemogenic effect of benzene is nonlinear and may derive from a threshold toxicity.,"['Lamm, S H', 'Walters, A S', 'Wilson, R', 'Byrd, D M', 'Grunwald, H']","['Lamm SH', 'Walters AS', 'Wilson R', 'Byrd DM', 'Grunwald H']","['Consultants in Epidemiology and Occupational Health, Inc., Washington, DC 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Risk']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8982289 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Jul;82:289-97. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8982289.,,,PMC1568109,,,['Environ Health Perspect. 1991 Feb;91:166-7.

The primary difference between these risk assessments has been in the way in which benzene exposure has been estimated and in the models applied to describe the dose-response relationship. The more recent assessments, in attempting to estimate benzene exposures on an individual basis, and in applying models which make maximal use of the available data points, represent a substantial improvement over earlier assessments. In this paper, we will review the available risk assessments and the data upon which they are based and will present our own assessment, which builds on prior efforts. Our reevaluation of the underlying data on the cohort that we judged to be most suitable for quantitative risk analysis suggested that past assessments may have overestimated risk by a factor of 3 to 24. In addition, we will present some recently made available data of relevance to the benzene exposure histories of cohort of concern. These data provide additional suggestion that the total benzene exposure of certain members of this cohort has likely been seriously underestimated, the extent to which remains to be determined. Further analysis of these data and pursuit of additional sources to improve the characterization of the benzene exposure of this cohort appear to be warranted in order to define more precisely the benzene-leukemia dose-response relationship.","['Brett, S M', 'Rodricks, J V', 'Chinchilli, V M']","['Brett SM', 'Rodricks JV', 'Chinchilli VM']","['Environ Corporation, Washington, DC 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Models, Biological', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.8982267 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1989 Jul;82:267-81. doi: 10.1289/ehp.8982267.,,,PMC1568141,,,['Environ Health Perspect. 1991 Feb;91:165-6.

Benzene causes leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, etc. The clinical and hematologic picture of aplastic anemia resulting from benzene exposure is not different from classical aplastic anemia; in some cases, mild bilirubinemia, changes in osmotic fragility, increase in lactic dehydrogenase and fecal urobilinogen, and occasionally some neurological abnormalities are found. Electromicroscopic findings in some cases of aplastic anemia with benzene exposure were similar to those observed by light microscopy. Benzene hepatitis-aplastic anemia syndrome was observed in a technician with benzene exposure. Ten months after occurrence of hepatitis B, a severe aplastic anemia developed. The first epidemiologic study proving the leukemogenicity of benzene was performed between 1967 and 1973 to 1974 among shoe workers in Istanbul. The incidence of leukemia was 13.59 per 100,000, which is a significant increase over that of leukemia in the general population. Following the prohibition and discontinuation of the use of benzene in Istanbul, there was a striking decrease in the number of leukemic shoe workers in Istanbul. In 23.7% of our series, consisting of 59 leukemic patients with benzene exposure, there was a preceding pancytopenic period. Furthermore, a familial connection was found in 10.2% of them. The 89.8% of our series showed the findings of acute leukemia. The possible factors that may determine the types of leukemia in benzene toxicity are discussed.

These composite studies on benzene were designed and conducted because of large production volume and widespread human exposure, because of the epidemiologic association with leukemia, and because previous experiments were considered inadequate or inconclusive for determining carcinogenicity in laboratory animals. Using the results from 17-week studies, doses for the 2-year studies were selected based on clinical observations (tremors in higher dosed mice), on clinical pathologic findings (lymphoid depletion in rats and leukopenia in mice), and on body weight effects. Doses of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg body weight benzene in corn oil were administered by gavage to male rats, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. Doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg benzene in corn oil were administered by gavage to female rats and to male and female mice for 103 weeks. Ten animals in each of the 16 groups were killed at 12 months, and necropsies were performed. Hematologic profiles were performed at 3-month intervals. For the 2-year studies, mean body weights of the top dose groups of male rats and of both sexes of mice were lower than those of the controls. Survivals of the top dose group of rats and mice of each sex were reduced; however, at week 92 for rats and week 91 for mice, survival was greater than 60% in all groups; most of the dosed animals that died before week 103 had neoplasia. Compound-related nonneoplastic or neoplastic effects on the hematopoietic system, Zymbal gland, forestomach, and adrenal gland were found both for rats and mice. Further, the oral cavity was affected in rats, and the lung, liver, Harderian gland, preputial gland, ovary, and mammary gland were affected in mice. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of benzene in male F344/N rats, female F344/N rats, male B6C3F1 mice, and female B6C3F1 mice. In male rats, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas, squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, and squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

P2B/LAMP-1 possesses 20 asparagine-linked glycosylation sites separated into equal halves by a central, putative hinge region and is anchored by a carboxy, membrane-spanning, domain. Topological considerations dictate that cell surface expression of P2B/LAMP-1 exposes the bulk of the glycoprotein into the extracellular compartment. Immunofluorescent staining of fibroblast cells indicated that P2B/LAMP-1 was associated with lysosomal membranes and, to a lesser degree, select surfaces of plasma membrane. An amino acid comparison of the murine sequence with its recently cloned rat, human, and chicken counterparts shows a conservation of 17 of 20 asparagine-linked glycosylation consensus sites, eight of eight cysteine residues, and other selected protein domains. The interspecies conservation of these domains suggests that they are important for the structure and function of the P2B/LAMP-1 glycoprotein. Northern analysis revealed that P2B/LAMP-1 is widely expressed in normal murine tissues and tumor cell lines. However, in two experimental models of metastasis, where changes in branching of oligosaccharides on P2B/LAMP-1 have been shown to occur, comparable levels of P2B/LAMP-1 mRNA were found in both metastatic and nonmetastatic cell lines.","['Heffernan, M', 'Yousefi, S', 'Dennis, J W']","['Heffernan M', 'Yousefi S', 'Dennis JW']","['Division of Cancer and Cell Biology, Mount Sinai Hospital Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Lamp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lamp1 protein, rat)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology', 'Oligosaccharides/analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Nov 1;49(21):6077-84.,,,,,,,['GENBANK/UNKNOWN'],,,,,

To optimize gene transfer and expression, the following promoters were linked to ada: the Maloney murine leukemia virus promoter within the long-terminal repeat, the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, the thymidine kinase promoter, or the human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Sequences were transfected into the helper virus-free retroviral packaging psi-2 cell line. Recombinant retroviruses were tested in CCL-1 cells, which, like most murine tissues, have low levels of alkyltransferase and are sensitive to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)nitrosourea (BCNU), and in NIH-3T3 cells, which are BCNU resistant and have high levels of alkyltransferase. Lines infected with each of the four retroviruses were selected for neo expression and found to have intact proviral integration and ada gene expression. Alkyltransferase activity was greatest with retrovirus containing the Rous sarcoma virus-ada gene; infected NIH-3T3 cells had up to 2300 units of alkyltransferase/mg of protein compared with 151 units/mg of protein in control cells, and infected CCL-1 cells had up to 1231 units/mg of protein compared with 33 units/mg of protein in control cells. CCL-1 cells expressing ada were more resistant to BCNU cytotoxicity than were controls. However, NIH-3T3 cells expressing ada were only slightly more resistant to BCNU than controls, possibly because most of the ada protein was cytoplasmic rather than nuclear as suggested by immunohistochemical stain. These studies establish a series of retroviruses containing the bacterial ada gene, which efficiently infect mammalian cells. ada expression increases nitrosourea resistance in cells with low mammalian alkyltransferase activity.","['Dumenco, L L', 'Warman, B', 'Hatzoglou, M', 'Lim, I K', 'Abboud, S L', 'Gerson, S L']","['Dumenco LL', 'Warman B', 'Hatzoglou M', 'Lim IK', 'Abboud SL', 'Gerson SL']","['R.L.

For a constant thymidine concentration (500 micrograms/ml), thymidine-carboplatin interaction increased with longer thymidine exposures until about 16 to 24 h. Thymidine and 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia (for 1 h) together enhanced carboplatin killing significantly more than did hyperthermia-carboplatin or thymidine-carboplatin combinations.

A mouse monoclonal antibody (HIS30) was developed against LAMA cells. HIS30 reacts with a membrane antigen in tumor tissue, whereas its reactivity with normal tissues is limited to the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex and to the adrenal medulla. HIS30 was used for both the immunohistological detection of tumor cells in tissue sections and the immunolocalization of tumor cells in vivo. To enable in vitro studies with the LAMA model, an in vitro growing cell line (LAMA-K1) was established from the LAMA tumor. LAMA-K1 is immunophenotypically similar to the original tumor. Two tumor transplantation models were characterized. In the first model LAMA was implanted s.c., and local tumor growth occurred at the injection site, which was then followed by lymphatogenic and subsequently hematogenic tumor spread. In the second model i.v. transplantation caused direct hematogenic tumor dissemination. In both models early dissemination was especially prominent to the bone marrow, spleen, and liver. Later in the disease most visceral organs became involved, and partial paralysis of the animal was observed in the end stage of the disease. In combination with HIS30, the LAMA pre-B-cell tumor offers a model for both the investigation of in vivo transplanted tumor cells and for the in vivo detection of tumor cells by HIS30 in LAMA tumor-bearing rats.","['De Jonge, M W', 'De Leij, L', 'Mesander, G', 'Deenen, G J', 'Opstelten, D', 'Kroese, F G', 'van Imhoff, G W', 'Nieuwenhuis, P', 'The, T H']","['De Jonge MW', 'De Leij L', 'Mesander G', 'Deenen GJ', 'Opstelten D', 'Kroese FG', 'van Imhoff GW', 'Nieuwenhuis P', 'The TH']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 15;49(20):5682-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the Ph chromosome has been characterized molecularly to involve a reciprocal translocation between the ABL and BCR genes, there is an increasing interest in the use of molecular probes to detect chromosomal rearrangements in this disease. While rearrangements involving the bcr region of the BCR gene can be detected by conventional gel electrophoresis (CGE), detection of those involving ABL generally requires pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Currently, however, CGE and PFGE require different methods of cell preparation, with isolated DNA used in CGE and gel inserts containing whole cells used in PFGE. In this study, we show that the gel-insert method of DNA preparation can be adapted for use in CGE with slight modification of the gel-running conditions. The advantages of this method are demonstrated by studying both bcr and ABL rearrangements in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of CML patients. Furthermore, we report a novel finding that chromosomal breakpoints in the ABL gene of CML patients occur predominantly between exons 1b and 1a.","['Jiang, X Y', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Dao, D', 'Liang, J C']","['Jiang XY', 'Trujillo JM', 'Dao D', 'Liang JC']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas, M.

Ninety-two consecutive patients in complete remission received BMT for ALL (n = 82) or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with poor prognostic factors at diagnosis (n = 10). Sixty-six patients received allogeneic BMT (Allo-BMT) and 26 patients, without an identical sibling, underwent autologous BMT (Auto-BMT). Fifteen patients had CNS involvement at diagnosis and underwent BMT in first remission. Eight patients experienced CNS relapse after BMT, corresponding to a probability of 11% at 3 years. Apart from a history of prior CNS involvement, no patient characteristic evaluated statistically influenced CNS relapse after BMT. The probability of CNS relapse was 5.5% for the 70 patients without history of CNS involvement and 27.5% for the 22 patients with prior CNS involvement. However, subgroup analysis showed that the increased risk of CNS relapse is mainly observed in Auto-BMT patients with history of prior CNS involvement, particularly in patients undergoing BMT in first remission (three of five Auto-BMT versus one of ten Allo-BMT). Taking into account the multiple factors which influence the occurrence and the treatment of CNS leukemia, the results on this retrospective study suggests that (1) for patients without CNS involvement at diagnosis and for whom BMT is performed in first remission, cranial irradiation before BMT and posttransplant prophylactic CNS therapy can be omitted because of the low probability of CNS relapse after BMT (3.4%), when total-body irradiation (TBI) is included in the conditioning regimen; and (2) the difference observed between Allo-BMT and Auto-BMT patients with previous CNS involvement and undergoing BMT in first remission could indicate that graft-versus-host leukemia acts even in the CNS in Allo-BMT patients.","['Ganem, G', 'Kuentz, M', 'Bernaudin, F', 'Gharbi, A', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Lemerle, S', 'Karianakis, G', 'Vinci, G', 'Rochant, H', 'Lebourgeois, J P']","['Ganem G', 'Kuentz M', 'Bernaudin F', 'Gharbi A', 'Cordonnier C', 'Lemerle S', 'Karianakis G', 'Vinci G', 'Rochant H', 'Lebourgeois JP', 'et al.']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19891101)64:9<1796::aid-cncr2820640907>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1989 Nov 1;64(9):1796-804. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19891101)64:9<1796::aid-cncr2820640907>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present an overview of purine metabolism in order to highlight enzymatic steps which are targeted by antileukemic drugs. Purine antimetabolites used in the treatment of leukemia can be grouped into three classes: (1) structural analogs of normal purines (6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine); (2) inhibitors of de novo purine biosynthesis (methotrexate and hydroxyurea); and (3) inhibitors of purine salvage (2'-deoxycoformycin). In addition, a number of investigational drugs (trimetrexate, fludarabine and 2'-chlorodeoxyadenosine) have been recently introduced and show promise in early clinical trials. Purine antimetabolites are active in a variety of lymphoid and myeloid leukemias and represent an important component of the therapy of these disorders. Several of the drugs have been developed with the specific intent of perturbing enzymes involved in purine metabolism. Refinements in our understanding of purine biochemistry in normal and leukemic cells may aid future efforts to design more effective drugs.","['Riscoe, M K', 'Brouns, M C', 'Fitchen, J H']","['Riscoe MK', 'Brouns MC', 'Fitchen JH']","['Medical Research Service, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Portland, Oregon 97207.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Purines)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drugs, Investigational/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(89)90013-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(89)90013-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1989 Sep;3(3):162-73. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(89)90013-1.,['CA37881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,119,,

This extraordinary diversity at the V.J junction, due to the use of two D delta elements and extensive incorporation of N nucleotides, constitutes a specific clonal marker for cell populations exhibiting rearranged TCR delta genes. To this end we amplified in vitro by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the TCR delta junctional region of five acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), isolated respective DNA fragments, and used them directly as clonospecific probes. The combination of PCR technology and hybridization to clonospecific probes permitted the detection of leukemia DNA at dilution of 1:100,000 in all five cases. Moreover, we were able to investigate one of the ALL patients 11 months after achieving continuous complete remission. Conventional Southern blot analysis failed to detect rearranged TCR genes at this stage. However, residual leukemic cells could readily be detected by PCR technique.

All patients ages 16 to 80, including those with secondary AML (SAML) and those with AML preceded by a hematologic disorder (AHD), were treated, regardless of medical complications at the time of diagnosis. The first study combined high doses of cytarabine (ara-C, AC) and daunorubicin (DRN, D) in sequence (Ac2-D-Ac) and resulted in a complete remission rate of 55%. A group of these patients selected by functional status was able to receive a second course of therapy in remission, which resulted in a disease-free survival (DFS) of greater than 40% at 7 years. Because of toxicity in that study, 114 patients were entered on a second trial initiated 4 years ago, using a less aggressive first course, with amsacrine, to achieve a stable remission (Ac2-D-Amsa). This first treatment was followed by a more intensive second course (Ac6-D-Ac). With this two-step approach, a higher complete remission (CR) rate (76% for de novo AML and 54% for SAML-AHD) was achieved, and more patients were able to receive the second course of therapy. At the current median follow-up of 26 months, the median duration of DFS and overall survival are 11 and 14 months for patients with de novo AML. Age less than or equal to 55 is the most significant prognostic factor for both prolonged DFS and overall survival, with median durations of 17 and 18 months, respectively, for these younger patients.

We have examined the roles of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) in the proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells. IL-6 activity was assessed in conditioned medium (CM) from myeloid leukemia cell cultures or cell lysates using IL-6-dependent KD83 and 7TD1 murine cell lines. Media conditioned by cells from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), but not by normal monocytes, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, contained substantial levels (50 to 1,000 U/10(6) cells) of IL-6. The IL-6 content of CM correlated directly with donor peripheral blood WBC count. CM from two of five CMMoL samples also contained greater than 350 pg/mL GM-CSF. Moreover, CMMoL cells spontaneously formed colonies in semisolid medium. CMMoL colony formation could be partially inhibited by antibodies to IL-6 or GM-CSF, whereas combination of these antibodies gave additive, and nearly complete (greater than 93%), inhibition of spontaneous colony formation. Cell lysates from uncultured CMMoL cells from one patient contained abundant GM-CSF protein but no detectable IL-6. These data suggest that IL-6 and GM-CSF act in vitro as autocrine growth factors for CMMoL cells, and that CMMoL cells in vivo may represent a GM-CSF-dependent autocrine growth system.","['Everson, M P', 'Brown, C B', 'Lilly, M B']","['Everson MP', 'Brown CB', 'Lilly MB']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alabama Birmingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biological Factors/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*blood', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75652-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1989 Oct;74(5):1472-6.,"['AI-18958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

During the three last years, the question of side effects of hGH therapy has been raised in the literature two times running: risk of MCJ and risk of leukaemia. Then, the question of the long term vigilance of all treated patients with hGH deficiency should be done.","['Goujard, J', 'Entat, M', 'Maillard, F', 'Mugnier, E', 'Rappaport, R', 'Job, J C']","['Goujard J', 'Entat M', 'Maillard F', 'Mugnier E', 'Rappaport R', 'Job JC']","[""l'Unite INSERM 149 (Recherches Epidemiologiques sur la Mere et l'Enfant, Paris.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Arch Fr Pediatr,Archives francaises de pediatrie,0372421,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'France', 'Growth Hormone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced']",1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Fr Pediatr. 1989 Jun-Jul;46(6):411-6.,,Evaluation des risques lies au traitement par l'hormone de croissance humaine (hGH) extractive.

Apropos of a case with prolymphocytic leukemia].",381-7,"We report a case of Bazex-Dupre-Christol (BDC) syndrome in a girl who died of prolymphocytic leukaemia at the age of 10 years. This is the first published case where the syndrome is associated with a blood disease. A review of the literature has enabled us to collect the various symptoms of BDC syndrome and to discuss the relationship of the syndrome with basal cell nevomatosis. We do not think that the blood disease was incidental. The child was 5 years' old in June 1972 when she was first seen in our out-patient clinic for severe hypotrichosis which had been present at birth and involved the eyelashes and eyebrows. Examination of the skin showed numerous milia on the face, a small lenticular polycystic lesion on the right ear, follicular atrophodermia on the back of the hands and hypotrichosis of the face. The right ear lesion was removed and found to look like Winer's cutaneous calcinosis. At light microscopy, many hairs showed like pili torti or, more rarely, like trichorrhexis nodosa. Despite the absence of basal cell carcinoma, the diagnosis of BDC syndrome was regarded as final. The patient died aged 10 years of prolymphocytic leukaemia revealed by pancytopenia. Combined chemotherapy with Rubidomycin, Oncovin and methotrexate had proved ineffective. Having collected from the literature 44 adequately documented cases summarized in table I, we describe the anatomico-clinical manifestations of Bazex-Dupre-Christol syndrome. Follicular atrophodermia is present in 85 p. 100 of the cases, but its date and mode of onset are difficult to evaluate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Colomb, D', 'Ducros, B', 'Boussuge, N']","['Colomb D', 'Ducros B', 'Boussuge N']","['Service de Dermatologie, Hotel-Dieu, Lyon.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Alopecia/*complications', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*complications', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypotrichosis/*complications/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*complications', 'Skin Diseases/*complications/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications', 'Syndrome']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1989;116(5):381-7.,,"Le syndrome de Bazex, Dupre et Christol.
