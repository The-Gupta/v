One of the methylated mouse genes identified in this way was Slit2. There are three mammalian SLIT genes (SLIT1, SLIT2, SLIT3), that belong to a highly conserved family of axon guidance molecules. We have previously demonstrated that SLIT2 is frequently inactivated in lung, breast, colorectal and glioma tumors by hypermethylation of a CpG island in its promoter region, whilst inactivating somatic mutations are rare. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SLIT2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in breast and colorectal cancer cells. In this report we determined the methylation status of the SLIT2 gene in leukemias (CLL and ALL). SLIT2 was methylated in all ten leukemia cell lines analyzed (eight completely and two partially methylated). SLIT2 expression was restored after treating ALL lines with 5-aza-2dC. In primary ALL and CLL samples, SLIT2 was also frequently methylated, 58% (30/52) B-ALL; 83% (10/12) T-ALL and in 80% (24/30) CLL. Whilst DNA from peripheral blood and bone marrow from healthy control samples showed no SLIT2 methylation. Methylation results in leukemia cell lines and ALL and CLL primary samples were confirmed by direct sequencing of bisulfite modified DNA. Our results demonstrate that methylation of the SLIT2 5' CpG island is conserved between mice and humans, and therefore is likely to be of functional importance.","['Dunwell, Thomas L', 'Dickinson, Rachel E', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Dallol, Ashraf', 'Weston, Victoria', 'Austen, Belinda', 'Catchpoole, Daniel', 'Maher, Eamonn R', 'Latif, Farida']","['Dunwell TL', 'Dickinson RE', 'Stankovic T', 'Dallol A', 'Weston V', 'Austen B', 'Catchpoole D', 'Maher ER', 'Latif F']","['Section of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090501,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', 'R6FXH13RRC (Slit homolog 2 protein)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/10 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['9137 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.9137 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2009 May 16;4(4):265-9. doi: 10.4161/epi.9137.

We have previously prepared a novel monoclonal agonistic antibody against human death receptor 5 (DR5) and designated it as mDRA-6. This study was to explore the Caspase-dependent molecular mechanisms of mDRA-6 inducing apoptosis of human leukemia Jurkat cells. METHODS: After exposure to different doses of mDRA-6, DNA fragmentation of Jurkat cells was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. Jurkat cells were further treated with the inhibitors for Caspase-10, -9, -8 and -3. The active cleavage products of Caspase-10, -9, -8, -3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid), truncated Bid (tBid) and cytochrome c (Cyto c), were analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: After mDRA-6 treatment, DNA fragmentation was detected in Jurkat cells. mDRA-6 inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. When treated with 2.0 microg/mL mDRA-6, the apoptosis rates of Jurkat cells were 16.2% at 0.25 h, 28.3% at 0.5 h, 69.2% at 1 h and 78.2% at 2 h. Interestingly, the mDRA-6-induced apoptosis was repressed by 77.9% by Caspase-8 inhibitor ZIF, 54.2% by Caspase-3 inhibitor ZDF, and 8.7% by Caspase-9 inhibitor ZLF, but was not repressed by Caspase-10 inhibitor ZAF. After mDRA-6 exposure, the proenzymes of Caspase-8, -9 and -3 were reduced and their active cleavage products were increased along with the increase of exposure time, the cleavage products of PARP were also increased, Bid was degraded to tBid, and an abundance of Cyto c was released from mitochondria, but the proenzyme of Caspase-10 showed no change and no cleavage products of Caspase-10 were detectable. CONCLUSION: mDRA-6 can induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells via the Caspase-dependent and mitochondrial pathways.","['Du, Yao-Wu', 'Liu, Guang-Chao', 'Wang, Jing', 'Zhao, Yue-Ping', 'Li, Shu-Lian', 'Chen, Ju-Gao', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Cai, Jing', 'Ma, Yuan-Fang']","['Du YW', 'Liu GC', 'Wang J', 'Zhao YP', 'Li SL', 'Chen JG', 'Jiang Q', 'Cai J', 'Ma YF']","['Institute of Immunology, Medical College, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090227,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-alanyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 10/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['8423 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2009 Feb;28(2):112-6.

Abnormal centrosomes exist in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients at different stages; furthermore, the degree of abnormality is associated with the clinical stage and more severe in the blast crisis stage. This study was to establish the leukemia cell line K562 with the exogenous wild-type p53 (wt-p53) gene, and to explore the effect of the p53 gene on centrosomes in K562 cells. METHODS: The recombinant adenoviruses carrying the wt-p53 gene (Ad5wtp53), the mutant p53 gene (Ad5mtp53) and the green fluorescent protein gene (Ad5GFP) were amplified respectively in HEK293 cells, and co-infected with cation polybrene into K562 cells respectively; uninfected K562 cells were used as blank control. The infection efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometry. P53 expression was detected by Western blot. Centrosomes were counted under the laser confocal microscope after indirect immunofluorescence staining. The expression of Gadd45a (growth arrest and DNA damage), BubR1 (Bub 1 related) and Aurora A was detected by western blot. RESULTS: K562 cell line with exogenous wt-p53 gene was established. The infection efficiencies of three groups were over 60%, and P53 sustained expression for 72 h. The percentage of cells with amplified centrosomes (more than 2/cell) in Ad5wtp53 group was decreased to (0.38 +/- 0.02)%, lower than that of blank control group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the protein levels of Gadd45a and BubR1 in Ad5wtp53 group were upregulated by 93% and 88% of blank control (p < 0.05), respectively, and the protein level of Aurora A was downregulated by 56% of blank control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: P53 protein is sustained to express in K562 cells after being infected by Ad5wtp53. wt-p53 can suppress excessive replication of centrosomes that may contribute to the upregulation of Gadd45a and BubR1 protein expression as well as the downregulation of Aurora A protein expression.","['Tian, Wen-Jun', 'Feng, Wen-Li', 'Wang, Hong-Bin', 'Huang, Shi-Feng', 'Cao, Wei-Xi', 'Huang, Zong-Gan']","['Tian WJ', 'Feng WL', 'Wang HB', 'Huang SF', 'Cao WX', 'Huang ZG']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, Chongqing, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090223,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bub1 spindle checkpoint protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Genotype', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['8425 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2009 Feb;28(2):122-6.

This study was to explore the reversal effect of PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 on p-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance in human leukemia cell line K562/DNR and gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/ADR. METHODS: The cells were divided into simple drug-treated groups and LY294002 pretreated groups: the former groups received treatment of daunorubicin (DNR), adriamycin (ADR), vincristine (VCR) and etoposide (VP-16), respectively; the latter groups received pretreatment of LY294002 before drug treatment. Trypan blue dye exclusion method and MTT assay were used to detect the drug sensitivity of K562/DNR and SGC7901/ADR cells, and the effect of LY294002 on the drug resistance. The expression of P-gp and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) in K562/DNR, SGC7901/ADR and their parental cell lines K562 and SGC7901 was detected by Western blot. Intracellular drug accumulation was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: LY294002 pretreatment significantly decreased the 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of DNR, ADR, VCR and VP-16 for K562/DNR cells, with reverse efficiencies of 72.4%, 64.9%, 60.4% and 52.8%. In SGC7901/ADR cells, the similar result was obtained with a reverse efficiency of 31.0%. LY294002 pretreatment partially inhibited the expression of p-Akt and P-gp, and promoted the intracellular accumulation of DNR and ADR in K562/DNR and SGC7901/ADR cells, respectively.

However, the mechanism is not clear yet. This study was to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells using ATRA and NSC67657, and compare the protein expression patterns using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). METHODS: HL-60 cells were cultured with ATRA and NSC67657 respectively. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay. Cellular surface specific antigen CD11b/CD14 was detected using flow cytometry (FCM) to assess cell differentiation. The alterations of cell morphology were observed with cellular chemical staining under electron microscope. Total protein was separated by modified 2-DE. The differentially expressed proteins were identified using PD-Quest software and analyzed by MOLDI-TOF MS. ICAT protein with differential expression was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. RESULTS: The granulocytic and monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells was induced by ATRA and NSC67657, respectively. The positive rates of both CD11b and CD14 in HL-60 cells were over 90% after 5-day treatment (2 micromol/L ATRA or 10 micromol/L NSC67657); cell morphology also represented characteristics of differentiation. Proteomic analysis showed that 25 proteins were differentially expressed with the same pattern in both differentiation groups, ten were differentially expressed only in monocytic differentiation group and 15 only in granulocytic differentiation group. Among them, ICAT expression was upregulated during NSC67657-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: A batch of differentially expressed proteins has be found by 2-DE in HL-60 cells with granulocytic and monocytic differentiation, which would contribute to the following functional research on related proteins.","['Wang, Wei-Jia', 'Tang, Wei', 'Qiu, Zong-Yin']","['Wang WJ', 'Tang W', 'Qiu ZY']","['Key Laboratory of Chongqing, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 ((4-(10, 13-dimethyl-3-methylsulfonyloxy-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16,', '17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopenta(a)phenanthren-17-yl)pentyl) methanesulfonate)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CTNNBIP1 protein, human)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Mesylates)', '0 (Steroids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Mesylates/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steroids/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['8424 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2009 Feb;28(2):117-21.

A total of 127 JAK2V617F-mutated patients (68% of whole series) were divided in quartiles of V617F allele burden. After a median follow-up of 17.2 months, 23 patients died, 15 because of leukemia. A JAK2V617F mutated status did not impact on the rate of leukemia transformation or overall survival. Patients in the lower quartile had shorter time to anemia and leukopenia and did not progress to large splenomegaly. Furthermore, survival was significantly reduced in the lower quartile compared with upper quartiles and JAK2 wild-type patients. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with reduced survival were age, a blast count more than 1%, and a JAK2V617F burden within first quartile. Causes of death in the lower quartile were represented mainly by systemic infections. We conclude that a low JAK2V617F allele burden at diagnosis is preferentially associated with a myelodepletive rather than myeloproliferative phenotype and represents an independent factor associated with shortened survival in patients with PMF.","['Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Barosi, Giovanni', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Antonioli, Elisabetta', 'Pieri, Lisa', 'Pancrazzi, Alessandro', 'Ponziani, Vanessa', 'Delaini, Federica', 'Longo, Giovanni', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Liso, Vincenzo', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M']","['Guglielmelli P', 'Barosi G', 'Specchia G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Lo Coco F', 'Antonioli E', 'Pieri L', 'Pancrazzi A', 'Ponziani V', 'Delaini F', 'Longo G', 'Ammatuna E', 'Liso V', 'Bosi A', 'Barbui T', 'Vannucchi AM']","['Unita Funzionale di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Area Critica, Universita di Firenze, and Istituto Toscano Tumori, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090623,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phenylalanine/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Valine/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37172-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-216044 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 20;114(8):1477-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-216044.

We present a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who died from Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) despite appropriate anti-Pneumocystis therapy. Although substantial advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PCP have decreased its frequency and improved prognosis, PCP continues to be seen in both HIV-infected patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. Pneumocystis species comprise a family of fungi, each of which appears to be able to infect only 1 host species. Pneumocystis has a worldwide distribution. Immunocompetent hosts clear infection without obvious clinical consequences. Pneumocystis has been identified in patients with other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although its clinical impact is uncertain. Immunocompromised patients develop disease as a consequence of reinfection and possibly reactivation of latent infection. In patients with HIV infection, the CD4 count is predictive of the risk for developing PCP, but such reliable markers are not available for other immunocompromised populations. In the majority of patients with PCP, multiple Pneumocystis strains can be identified using recently developed typing techniques.

In this study, we investigated the expression of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, in CLL and its role in apoptosis. Gene expression profiling identified enhanced expression of SYK and downstream pathways in CLL compared with healthy B cells. Immunoblotting showed increased expression and phosphorylation of SYK, PLCgamma(2), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 in CLL compared with healthy B cells, suggesting enhanced activation of these mediators in CLL. SYK inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of SYK downstream targets and induced apoptosis in primary CLL cells. With respect to prognostic factors, SYK inhibitors exerted stronger cytotoxic effects in unmutated and ZAP70(+) cases. Cytotoxic effects of SYK inhibitors also associated with SYK protein expression, potentially predicting response to therapy. Combination of fludarabine with SYK Inhibitor II or R406 increased cytotoxicity compared with fludarabine therapy alone. We observed no stroma-contact-mediated drug resistance for SYK inhibitors as described for fludarabine treatment. CD40 ligation further enhanced efficacy of SYK inhibition. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the recently observed therapeutic effects of the SYK inhibitor R406 in CLL. Combination of SYK inhibitors with fludarabine might be a novel treatment option particularly for CLL patients with poor prognosis and should be further evaluated in clinical trials.","['Buchner, Maike', 'Fuchs, Simon', 'Prinz, Gabriele', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Bartholome, Kilian', 'Burger, Meike', 'Chevalier, Nina', 'Vallat, Laurent', 'Timmer, Jens', 'Gribben, John G', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Dierks, Christine', 'Zirlik, Katja']","['Buchner M', 'Fuchs S', 'Prinz G', 'Pfeifer D', 'Bartholome K', 'Burger M', 'Chevalier N', 'Vallat L', 'Timmer J', 'Gribben JG', 'Jumaa H', 'Veelken H', 'Dierks C', 'Zirlik K']","['University Medical Center Freiburg, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090623,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0', '(N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-pyrid(1,4)oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyph', 'enyl)-2,4-pyrimidinediamine)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oxazines/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Syk Kinase', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4252 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4252 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 1;69(13):5424-32. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4252.

Pemetrexed has more than one site of action; the primary site is thymidylate synthase. We now report that the secondary target is the downstream folate-dependent enzyme in de novo purine synthesis, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICART). The substrate of the AICART reaction, ZMP, accumulated in intact pemetrexed-inhibited tumor cells, identifying AICART as the step in purine synthesis that becomes rate-limiting after drug treatment. The accumulating ZMP causes an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase with subsequent inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hypophosphorylation of the downstream targets of mTOR that control initiation of protein synthesis and cell growth. We suggest that the activity of pemetrexed against human cancers is a reflection of its direct inhibition of folate-dependent target proteins combined with prolonged inhibition of the mTOR pathway secondary to accumulation of ZMP.","['Racanelli, Alexandra C', 'Rothbart, Scott B', 'Heyer, Cortney L', 'Moran, Richard G']","['Racanelli AC', 'Rothbart SB', 'Heyer CL', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Pharmacology and the Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298-0035, USA.']",['eng'],"['F30-HL094068/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA027605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA027605-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 HL094068/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090623,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '349-34-8 (phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Adenylate Kinase/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Glutamates/*therapeutic use', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pemetrexed', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/biosynthesis/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4979 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4979 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 1;69(13):5467-74. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4979.

Despite the availability of a wide spectrum of statistical procedures, the users of the high-throughput platforms are still facing the crucial challenge of deciding which test statistic is best adapted to the intrinsic properties of their own datasets. To meet this challenge, we recently introduced an adaptive procedure, named ROTS (Reproducibility-Optimized Test Statistic), which learns an optimal statistic directly from the given data, and whose relative benefits have previously been shown in comparison with state-of-the-art procedures for detecting differential expression. Using gene expression microarray and mass-spectrometry (MS)-based protein expression datasets as case studies, we illustrate here the practical usage and advantages of ROTS toward detecting reliable marker lists in clinical transcriptomic and proteomic studies. In a public leukemia microarray dataset, the procedure could improve the sensitivity of the gene marker lists detected with high specificity. When applied to a recent LC-MS dataset, involving plasma samples from severe burn patients, the procedure could identify several peptide markers that remained undetected in the conventional analysis, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of ROTS also for global quantitative proteomic studies. To promote its widespread usage, we have made freely available efficient implementations of ROTS, which are easily accessible either as a stand-alone R-package or as integrated in the open-source data analysis software Chipster.","['Elo, Laura L', 'Hiissa, Jukka', 'Tuimala, Jarno', 'Kallio, Aleksi', 'Korpelainen, Eija', 'Aittokallio, Tero']","['Elo LL', 'Hiissa J', 'Tuimala J', 'Kallio A', 'Korpelainen E', 'Aittokallio T']","['Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, FI-20014 Turku, Finland. laliel@utu.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090623,England,Brief Bioinform,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Software']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bbp033 [pii]', '10.1093/bib/bbp033 [doi]']",ppublish,Brief Bioinform. 2009 Sep;10(5):547-55. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbp033.

Persistent neutropenic fevers are documented during the empirical systemic antibacterial therapy for the first neutropenic fever, the cause of which is likely outside the spectrum of activity of the initial therapy. Recrudescent neutropenic fevers, defined by the appearance of a new fever after defervescence of the first fever, are often a function of invasive fungal infection or gram-positive infections outside the spectrum of the initial empirical antibacterial regimen.

Some potential factors influencing GVL such as chimerism patterns, autocytotoxic cells, dynamics of immune cells in patients, the cytokines and so on are reviewed in this article.","['Wei, Li', 'Ai, Hui-Sheng']","['Wei L', 'Ai HS']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/surgery']",2009/06/25 09:00,2011/08/25 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)03-0844-03 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jun;17(3):844-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral mononuclear cells from leukemia patients in complete remission were cultured with the specific cytokines to induce the production of DCs. The DCs loaded with RNA from autologous leukemic cells as antigen, and co-cultured with autologous T lymphocytes to get leukemia specific CTL. The cytotoxic activity of CTL against autologous leukemic cells was measured by LDH release method. The concentration of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the culture supernatant was measured by enzyme immunoassay. The effects of IL-21 on the mature DCs were also studied by the measurement of the phenotype of DC and the allogenic mixed lymphocytic reactions induced by DCs. Experiments were divided into 2 groups: test group in which IL-21 (200 ng/ml) was added in coculture of DC/CTL and control group in which no IL-21 (200 ng/ml) was added. The results showed that when cultured with IL-21, the quantity of CTL increased from (56.73 +/- 10.21)% (control group) to (73.43 +/- 18.01)% (p < 0.01); The concentration of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the culture supernatant increased from (154.91 +/- 67.20) ng/L (control group) to (310.62 +/- 141.15) ng/L (p < 0.01) and from (8.77 +/- 5.09) microg/L (control group) to (15.25 +/- 6.56) microg/L (p < 0.01) respectively. At the effector: target ratio of 20:1, the cytotoxic activity against autologous leukemic cells by CTL increased from (50.22 +/- 5.07)% (control group) to (75.38 +/- 9.47)% (p < 0.01). IL-21 had neither effect on the phenotype (CD1a, CD83, CD86, CD80 and HLA-DR) of mature DCs nor the allogeneic mixed lymphocytic reactions induced by DCs. It is concluded that IL-21 can strengthen the proliferation of CTL, and improve the production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, thus enhance the anti-leukemia activity of CTL. Nevertheless, there is no effect of IL-21 on the function of mature DCs.

The bone marrow and peripheral blood from 21 leukemia patients at remission stage after treatment and subjected to adoptive immunotherapy were collected. Their DCs and T-cells were stimulated with cytokines and then were mixed to activate T-cells. T-cell receptor beta variable region (TCRBV) families were amplified by RT-PCR, and genescan method and sequencing of the PCR products were used to observe the clonality changes of T-cells before and after the induction and cultivation of T-cells. The flow cytometry was used to identify CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD3(+)CD56(+) and CD4(+)CD25str(+)FOXP3(+) cells to disclose the ratio change of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), helper T-cells, regulatory T-cells and NK T-cells before and after induction and cultivation of T-cells. The results showed that in the 21 patients, most of the 24 TCRBV families presented as oligoclonal distribution on genescan, several families were not expressed, and only a few families remained polyclonal. TCRBV24 was found to be oligoclonal in all of the 21 patients. DNA sequence analysis of TCRBV24 revealed a common motif of VAG in CDR3 in 3 cases and a common motif of GGG in CDR3 in 2 cases. In patient 5, both TCRBV 24 and TCRBV8 contained the same motif of GGG in CDR3. The identical motif in these patients may suggest that these T-cells recognize the same antigen. The peripheral lymphocytes demonstrated recovery of clonal profile on genescan from oligoclonal profile and absence of several families before the induction and cultivation to typical polyclonal profile in all TCRBV families after the induction by DC and cytokines for 13 days. After the induction and cultivation, the number of lymphocytes increased to 3.38 +/- 1.20 times. CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD3(+)CD56(+) and CD4(+)CD25str(+)FOX P3(+) cells were 71.1 +/- 11.8%, 26.7 +/- 11.4%, 35.7 +/- 12.9%, 3.1 +/- 1.6% and 0.12 +/- 0.1% respectively before the induction and cultivation, and changed to 95.4 +/- 3.2% (p < 0.01), 27.0 +/- 13.1% (p > 0.01), 55.5 +/- 13.8% (p < 0.01), 9.8 +/- 6.1% (p < 0.01) and 0.22 +/- 0.18% (p < 0.01) respectively after the induction and cultivation. It is concluded that the major action of this induction and cultivation method on T-lymphocytes in vitro is the promotion of CTL and NK T-cell proliferation. In leukemic patients at the remission stage, the TCRBV profile is characterized by the oligoclonal proliferation of T-lymphocytes. Several proliferated clones may have the same motif in CDR3, suggesting the recognition of the same antigen by these lymphocyte clones. Cytokine induction and co-culture with autogenous DCs can stimulate the T-lymphocytes to recover their immunocompetence as manifested by the polyclonal profile and the proliferation of CTL and NK-T cells.","['Liu, Yan', 'Gu, Jiang-Ying', 'Ou, Yuan', 'Li, Mian-Yang', 'Wang, He', 'Jin, Xian', 'Tao, Xiu-Yan', 'Liu, Zhao-Li', 'Ma, Xing-Fan', 'Wang, Xiu-Li', 'Ma, Si-Kun', 'Kang, Rui', 'Cai, Peng', 'Tong, Chun-Rong', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Liu Y', 'Gu JY', 'Ou Y', 'Li MY', 'Wang H', 'Jin X', 'Tao XY', 'Liu ZL', 'Ma XF', 'Wang XL', 'Ma SK', 'Kang R', 'Cai P', 'Tong CR', 'Zhu P']","['Special Examination Center, Beijing Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/cytology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/chemistry/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/25 09:00,2011/08/25 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)03-0621-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jun;17(3):621-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of RAP1GAP in bone marrow cells of 19 MDS patients was detected by flow cytometry and was compared with that in patients with non-malignant blood diseases and acute leukemias, meanwhile the relevance between expression level of RAP1GAP and hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, blasts percentage in bone marrow cells and IPSS score was analyzed. The results indicated that the expression level of RAP1GAp in MDS patients significantly increased as compared with patients with non-malignant blood diseases or AML (8.42 +/- 8.37% vs 2.97 +/- 4.75% or 2.26 +/- 4.24%). Among MDS patients, the expression level of RAP1GAP in MDS-RA was significantly higher than that in MDS-RAEB (11.64 +/- 9.07% vs 4.37 +/- 4.65%). However, no definitive correlation of expression level with above-mentioned clinical parameters was found in detected patients with DMS. In conclusion, the expression of RAP1GAP in MDS patients obviously increases, the relationship between expression level of RAP1GAP and laboratory hematological parameter and IPSS score does not be confirmed.

The results indicated that 1 micro mol/L As(2)O(3) did not lead to significant apoptosis of Raji cells, 2 - 8 micromol/L As(2)O(3) induced Raji cell apoptosis. Along with increase of drug concentration, the mitochondrial respiratory function and membrane potential of Raji cells obviously decreased.

The results showed that the definite LAIP could be detected in 94.3% of the patients (115/122) with AML (except APL). Among 115 cases only one LAIP was identified in 15 cases (13.0%), but two or more LAIP were identified in other 100 cases (87.0%). The most frequent LAIP identified was cross-lineage antigen expression (40.9%). The percentages of asynchronous antigen expression, antigen over-expression and antigen lack expression were 20.9%, 27.0%and 34.8% respectively.

Armstrong et al. proposed MLL rearrangement positive ALL as a distinct subgroup, separated from acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloblastic leukemia (AML), with a specific gene expression profile. Here we show that MLL, from both ALL and AML origin, share a signature identified by a small set of genes suggesting a common genetic disregulation that could be at the basis of mixed lineage leukemia in both phenotypes. METHODS: Using Affymetrix(R) HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform, gene expression data from 140 (training set) + 78 (test set) ALL and AML patients with (24+13) and without (116+65) MLL rearrangements have been investigated performing class comparison (SAM) and class prediction (PAM) analyses. RESULTS: We identified a MLL translocation-specific (379 probes) signature and a phenotype-specific (622 probes) signature which have been tested using unsupervised methods. A final subset of 14 genes grants the characterization of acute leukemia patients with and without MLL rearrangements. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that a small subset of genes identifies MLL-specific rearrangements and clearly separates acute leukemia samples according to lineage origin. The subset included well-known genes and newly discovered markers that identified ALL and AML subgroups, with and without MLL rearrangements.","['Zangrando, Andrea', ""Dell'orto, Marta Campo"", 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Zangrando A', ""Dell'orto MC"", 'Te Kronnie G', 'Basso G']","['Laboratory of HematoOncology, Department of Pediatrics ""Salus Pueri"", University of Padova, Padova, Italy. andrea.zangrando@unipd.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090623,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,,,2009/06/25 09:00,2009/06/25 09:01,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:01 [medline]']","['1755-8794-2-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-2-36 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2009 Jun 23;2:36. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-2-36.,10.1186/1755-8794-2-36 [doi],PMC2709660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is undergoing a phase I clinical trial. Chemoresistance to anti-mitotic agents has been shown to be related, in part, to overexpression of ABC proteins. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential roles of P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP in cytotoxicity in AVE9633-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: This study used AML cell lines expressing different levels of P-gp, MRP1 or BCRP proteins and twenty-five samples from AML patients. Expression and functionality of the transporter protein were analyzed by flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity of the drug was evaluated by MTT and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: P-gp activity, but not MRP1 and BCRP, attenuated AVE9633 and DM4 cytotoxicity in myeloid cell lines. Zosuquidar, a potent specific P-gp inhibitor, restored the sensitivity of cells expressing P-gp to both AVE9633 and DM4. However, the data from AML patients show that 10/25 samples of AML cells (40%) were resistant to AVE9633 or DM4 (IC(50) > 500 nM), and this was not related to P-gp activity (p-Value: 0.7). Zosuquidar also failed to re-establish drug sensitivity. Furthermore, this resistance was not correlated with CD33 expression (p-Value: 0.6) in those cells. CONCLUSION: P-gp activity is not a crucial mechanism of chemoresistance to AVE9633. For patients whose resistance to conventional anthracycline AML regimens is related to ABC protein expression, a combination with AVE9633 could be beneficial. Other mechanisms such as microtubule alteration could play an important role in chemoresistance to AVE9633.","['Tang, Ruoping', 'Cohen, Simy', 'Perrot, Jean-Yves', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Zuany-Amorim, Claudia', 'Marjanovic, Zora', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Fava, Fanny', 'Corre, Elise', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre']","['Tang R', 'Cohen S', 'Perrot JY', 'Faussat AM', 'Zuany-Amorim C', 'Marjanovic Z', 'Morjani H', 'Fava F', 'Corre E', 'Legrand O', 'Marie JP']","['Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Hotel Dieu, 1 Place du Parvis de Notre-Dame, Paris Cedex 04, France. ruoping.tang@htd.aphp.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090623,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Dibenzocycloheptenes)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '14083FR882 (Maytansine)', '813AGY3126 (zosuquidar trihydrochloride)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Dibenzocycloheptenes/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Maytansine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-199 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-199 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Jun 23;9:199. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-199.,10.1186/1471-2407-9-199 [doi],PMC2708190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapy template was therefore altered to an American Children's Cancer Group (CCG) style regimen, including stratification by age, white cell count and early response to therapy by assessment of the bone marrow. This phase of the trial was designated ALL97/99. Comparison of the two phases showed that the event-free survival (EFS) for both ALL97 and ALL97/99 was better than previous UKALL trials, as was overall survival (OS) for ALL97/99.

Thrombocytopenia, attributable to ineffective platelet production by dysfunctional megakaryocytes, has been estimated to occur in 40-65% of patients. However, there are hardly any studies on the clinical relevance of low platelet counts in MDS. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 2900 patients in the Duesseldorf MDS Registry who were diagnosed at our laboratory between 1982 and 2007. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, 43% of the patients had a platelet count lower than 100 000/microL. Platelets were lower than 20 000/microL in 7% of the patients, especially in those with advanced stages of MDS, who showed a higher frequency of thrombocytopenia and platelet transfusion dependency. On multivariate analysis, platelet anisometry, hypocellularity of megakaryopoiesis, maturational defects of megakaryocytes and platelets <20 000/microL were independent variables showing a statistically significant correlation (P < 0.05) with clinical signs of bleeding. Platelets lower than 100 000/microL were associated with significantly shortened survival (P < 0.00005), because of an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (30% vs. 21%) (P < 0.02) and bleeding (16% vs. 8%) (P = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia is a strong predictor of short survival, with or without haemorrhagic complications.","['Neukirchen, Judith', 'Blum, Sabine', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Aivado, Manuel', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Germing, Ulrich']","['Neukirchen J', 'Blum S', 'Kuendgen A', 'Strupp C', 'Aivado M', 'Haas R', 'Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Germing U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University of Duesseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Duesseldorf, Germany.

There is a general consensus that elimination of chronic dental and oral infections prior to chemotherapy reduces the risk of serious problems that may require hospitalization. The limited time available for dental treatment prior to chemotherapy forces clinicians to prioritize. The aim of this study was to determine how hospital-based clinicians who routinely see leukemia patients prioritize dental treatment prior to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was conducted that targeted the membership of the American Academy of Maxillofacial Prosthetics because a large number of these clinicians had first-hand experience in managing leukemia patients. RESULTS: The consensus was that apical radiolucencies and severe periodontitis must be eliminated. Opinions differed regarding whether and how mild periodontal pathology and caries lesions should be treated. CONCLUSION: Most of the surveyed practitioners believed that infectious processes that invade the bone pose the highest risk if left untreated prior to chemotherapy.,"['Wong, Fong', 'Toljanic, Joseph A']","['Wong F', 'Toljanic JA']","['Department of Prosthodontics, Shands Teaching Hospital, University of Florida, PO Box 100435, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. fwong@dental.ufl.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Prosthodont,The International journal of prosthodontics,8900938,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Chronic Periodontitis/therapy', 'Consensus', 'Decision Making', '*Dental Care for Chronically Ill', 'Dental Caries/therapy', 'Dental Scaling', 'Dental Service, Hospital', 'Gingivitis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', '*Patient Care Planning', 'Periapical Diseases/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Root Canal Therapy', 'Root Planing', 'Time Factors', 'Tooth Diseases/*therapy', 'Tooth Extraction']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/06/25 09:00'],"['2009/06/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Prosthodont. 2009 May-Jun;22(3):303-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High expression of bcr-abl in mRNA and protein levels, and other alterations were found in patients who experienced imatinib treatment failures and thus it is important to design alternative treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of berbamine, on imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 (K562-r) cells, and explore the mechanisms. The growth of K562-r cells was examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Morphological analysis and DNA agarose electrophoresis were used to detect apoptosis in K562-r cells, and the extent of the cells in the sub-G1 cell cycle phase was measured using flow cytometry. The expression levels of BCR-ABL, phospho-BCR-ABL, and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), IkappaBalpha, phospho-IkappaBalpha, IkappaB kinases alpha(IKKalpha), and Survivin were determined by Western blot. bcr-abl mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. MTT assays indicated that berbamine significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562-r cells. Cells with characteristics of apoptosis were confirmed by morphology examination and DNA agarose electrophoresis and percentage of apoptosis were increased after treatment with berbamine. The results also showed that berbamine was able to down-regulate BCR-ABL and phospho-BCR-ABL proteins by affecting bcr-abl mRNA expression and decrease expression of nuclear NF-kappaB, phospho-IkappaBalpha, IKKalpha, and Survivin. Collectively, berbamine could inhibit the proliferation of K562-r cells and induce apoptosis. The mechanisms may be related at least in part, to inhibit BCR-ABL and its downstream NF-kappaB signaling. Berbamine may provide an alternative candidate for the treatment of patients with CML resistant to imatinib therapy.","['Wei, Yan-Lin', 'Liang, Yun', 'Xu, Lei', 'Zhao, Xiao-Ying']","['Wei YL', 'Liang Y', 'Xu L', 'Zhao XY']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anat Rec (Hoboken),"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)",101292775,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'V5KM4XJ0WM (berbamine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, abl/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Survivin', 'Tetrazolium Salts']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ar.20924 [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Rec (Hoboken). 2009 Jul;292(7):945-50. doi: 10.1002/ar.20924.,10.1002/ar.20924 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acteoside (50, 150, or 300 mg/kg) was administered via gavage daily for 12 days. The liver index (liver weight/body weight), liver homogenate levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatic nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, production of tumor necrosis factor-gamma (TNF-gamma) and interleukin-2, 4, 10 (IL-2, 4, 10), as well as histopathological changes of the liver were evaluated following the 12-day treatment. Moreover, the modulation influence of acteoside on the expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2, hepatocyte apoptosis inhibitor) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax, hepatocyte apoptosis promoter) in the mice liver with immunological hepatic injury was studied also. Acteoside (50, 150, or 300 mg/kg) effectively reduced the BCG/LPS-induced elevated liver index, liver homogenate AST and ALT levels, hepatic NO and MDA contents, restored hepatic SOD activity and reduced the degree of liver injury in ILI mice. The expression of Bax was decreased (vs. BCG + LPS model group), while the expression of Bcl-2 increased (vs. BCG + LPS model group).

The fibrotic process is evaluated by grading the amount of collagen deposited in the bone marrow interstitium. The established method to evaluate bone marrow fibrosis is staining for reticulin to visualise the collagen fibres. However, the extra cellular matrix does not only contain collagens but also other components, e.g. glycosaminoglycans of which hyaluronan is the most abundant. Hyaluronan is important for structural and cellular functions. Earlier studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between hyaluronan and reticulin staining in healthy volunteers and in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia. In this study bone marrow biopsies from 43 patients with a malignant disease involving the bone marrow were compared with 18 patients with a malignant disease not involving the bone marrow. The intensity of hyaluronan grading was significantly higher in the patients with disease involving the bone marrow compared to the healthy controls but not compared to the patients without disease involving the bone marrow. The staining intensity of reticulin in the bone marrow was significantly higher in the patients with disease involving the bone marrow, compared to those without disease involving the bone marrow and to the controls.

However, patients are also at high risk of opportunist pathogens such as Aspergillus spp. infection for their deeply depressed immunity. The optimal choice of antifungal agents during the infection of Aspergillus for these patients is necessary to be explored. In this study, we investigated the interactions between antifungals and methotrexate against Aspergillus in vitro. A total of 23 clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp. were studied. Microdilution checkerboard technique was performed to evaluate the interaction of methotrexate with voriconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine and amphotericin B. The highest rate of synergy was obtained for the combination of terbinafine and methotrexate, which exhibited synergy against 60.9% (14/23) of strains. No interaction was detected for the combinations of methotrexate plus itraconazole or amphotericin B against 95.7% (22/23) or 100% of strains, respectively. Although voriconazole exhibited indifferent against 87% (20/23) of strains when combined with methotrexate, antagonism effect was found against 13% (3/23) of strains. The positive interactions of terbinafine and methotrexate were also certified by disk diffusion assay. In addition, we observed the morphological changes for the interaction of methotrexate with terbinafine against Aspergillus. Further inhibition and distortion of growth were found after the combination of terbinafine and methotrexate compared with the drugs treated alone. Clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate optimal treatments for the immunocompromised patients with Aspergillus infection.","['Yang, Jianxun', 'Wan, Zhe', 'Wang, Xiaohong', 'Liu, Wei', 'Li, Ruoyu']","['Yang J', 'Wan Z', 'Wang X', 'Liu W', 'Li R']","['Department of Dermatology, Research Center of Medical Mycology, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University, No. 8 Xishiku St., West District, 100034, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090623,Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'G7RIW8S0XP (Terbinafine)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/pharmacology', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aspergillus/*drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Itraconazole/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Terbinafine', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Voriconazole']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/12/23 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11046-009-9218-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2009 Nov;168(5):237-42. doi: 10.1007/s11046-009-9218-4.

This study explored the impact of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 on the effect of cytarabien (AraC), one of the most commonly used anti-leukemia agents, to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of AML cells. AZD6244 effectively blocked AraC-induced MEK/ERK activation and enhanced its ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis of NB4 and HL60 cells in parallel with induction of DNA damage as measured by detection of gamma-H2AX by Western Blot analysis, resulting in enhanced expression of p21( waf1 ) and downregulation of c-Myc and Bcl-xl in these cells. Enhanced induction of apoptosis mediated by combination of AZD6244 and AraC was also shown in freshly isolated AML cells (n = 3). Taken together, concomitant administration of AraC and the inhibitor of MEK/ERK signaling may be useful for treatment of individuals with AML.","['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Nankoku, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/10/22 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0372-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 Sep;14(9):1108-20. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0372-4.,10.1007/s10495-009-0372-4 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seroprevalence was significantly high in the birth cohort of before 1950 (6.22%) and declined with birth-year. The time trend of the birth-cohort-specific seroprevalence showed almost no change within each birth cohort, except for the birth cohort of 1981-1990 that showed a significantly declining trend (P for trend = 0.006). Among the birth cohort of 1981-1990, the seroprevalence was stable among those born during 1981-1986 (0.66-0.83%), but was lower among those born during 1987-1990 (0-0.38%).

METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving 30 patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia in whom HRCT of the chest was performed within 24 h after the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis was confirmed, based on a positive culture of sputum or bronchial aspirate, together with a positive pleural fluid or blood culture, within one week after symptom onset. There were 20 male patients and 10 female patients. The median age was 21 years (range, 1-41 years). The BMT had been performed for the treatment of the following: chronic myeloid leukemia, in 14 cases; severe aplastic anemia, in 6; acute myeloid leukemia, in 4; Fanconi's anemia, in 3; and acute lymphocytic leukemia, in 3. Two radiologists analyzed the HRCT scans and reached their final decisions by consensus. RESULTS: The most common HRCT findings were air-space consolidation (in 60%), small centrilobular nodules (in 50%), ground-glass opacities (in 40%), bronchial wall thickening (in 20%), large nodules (in 20%), pleural lesions (in 16.7%) and tree-in-bud opacities (in 10%). The pulmonary lesions were distributed in the central and peripheral areas in 15 patients, whereas they were exclusively peripheral in 11. Lesions were located in the lower and middle lobes of the lung in 22 and 20 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The most common HRCT findings in our patient sample were air-space consolidation, small centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities, most often in the central and peripheral regions of the middle and lower lung zones.","['Coelho, Luiz Otavio de Mattos', 'Gasparetto, Taisa Davaus', 'Escuissato, Dante Luiz', 'Marchiori, Edson']","['Coelho LO', 'Gasparetto TD', 'Escuissato DL', 'Marchiori E']","['Clinica Diagnostico Avancado Por Imagem, Curitiba, Brazil.']","['eng', 'por']",,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,J Bras Pneumol,Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,101222274,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*diagnostic imaging/microbiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1806-37132009000500007 [pii]', '10.1590/s1806-37132009000500007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Bras Pneumol. 2009 May;35(5):431-5. doi: 10.1590/s1806-37132009000500007.,S1806-37132009000500007 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TRAIL use as a stand alone therapeutic is hampered by the fact that many primary tumor cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Here, we investigated the extent to which pretreatment of TRAIL-resistant primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) could render them susceptible to killing by TRAIL. We found that HDAC inhibition in B-CLL cells led to increased TRAIL receptor expression, increased caspase activation, decreased expression of antiapoptotic regulators such as Bcl-2, and ultimately, enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Importantly, untransformed peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained largely resistant to TRAIL, even in the presence of HDACis. These results suggest that combination therapies using HDAC inhibition and TRAIL could prove beneficial for the treatment of B-CLL.","['Norian, Lyse A', 'Kucaba, Tamara A', 'Earel, James K', 'Knutson, Tina', 'Vanoosten, Rebecca L', 'Griffith, Thomas S']","['Norian LA', 'Kucaba TA', 'Earel JK', 'Knutson T', 'Vanoosten RL', 'Griffith TS']","['Department of Urology and Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],['P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090614,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2009/06/24 09:00,2009/06/24 09:01,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/408038 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2009;2009:408038. doi: 10.1155/2009/408038.

The immediate and short-term TKI side effects are well known, but the long-term side effects have not yet been clearly identified. A preclinical study in rats treated with TKI showed a statistically significant increase in benign and malignant renal tumours. The authors report the case of a 61-year-old man with CML treated with imatinib with a good response, and they switched to dasatinib after grade 4 hepatic toxicity. He had received treatment with 400 mg of imatinib per day for 77 days, followed by dasatinib for 133 days. He developed a metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin during TKI therapy.

Dexamethasone's association with long-term neurocognitive toxicity is unknown. In this multisite study, we measured neurocognitive functioning in 92 children with standard-risk ALL, 1 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, at a mean of 9.8 years after randomization to prednisone (n = 41) or dexamethasone (n = 51) on Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1922. No significant overall differences in mean neurocognitive and academic performance scores were found between the prednisone and dexamethasone groups after adjusting for age, sex, and time since diagnosis. The exception was that patients receiving dexamethasone scored one-third of a standard deviation worse on word reading (98.8 +/- 1.7 vs 104.9 +/- 1.8; P = .02). There were no group differences in the distribution of test scores or the parents' report of neurologic complications, psychotropic drug use, and special education. Further analyses suggested for the dexamethasone group, older age of diagnosis was associated with worse neurocognitive functioning; for the prednisone group, younger age at diagnosis was associated with worse functioning. In conclusion, our study did not demonstrate any meaningful differences in long-term cognitive functioning of childhood ALL patients based on corticosteroid randomization.

Reversal of promoter methylation after therapy was observed in both clinical responders and nonresponders across all genes. There was no association between clinical response and either baseline methylation or methylation reversal in the bone marrow or purified CD34(+) population, nor was there an association with change in gene expression. Transient global hypomethylation was observed in samples after treatment but was not associated with clinical response. Induction of histone H3/H4 acetylation and the DNA damage-associated variant histone gamma-H2AX was observed in peripheral blood samples across all dose cohorts.

In the present study, the cervical cancer cell line HeLa has been employed as a model system to compare the topographic distribution of PS with the two PS binding proteins as adherent cells enter the apoptotic program. HeLa cells were cultured on glass-bottom Petri dishes, and apoptosis was induced by staurosporine. Fluorescence-labeled lactadherin and/or annexin V were used to detect PS exposure by confocal microscopy. Both lactadherin and annexin V staining revealed PS localized to plasma membrane rim and blebs.

Recent advances in immunophenotyping of hematopoietic progenitor and maturing cells in dysplastic bone marrow point to a useful role for multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) in the diagnosis and prognostication of myelodysplastic syndromes. In March 2008, representatives from 18 European institutes participated in a European LeukemiaNet (ELN) workshop held in Amsterdam as a first step towards standardization of FCM in myelodysplastic syndromes. Consensus was reached regarding standard methods for cell sampling, handling and processing. The group also defined minimal combinations of antibodies to analyze aberrant immunophenotypes and thus dysplasia. Examples are altered numbers of CD34(+) precursors, aberrant expression of markers on myeloblasts, maturing myeloid cells, monocytes or erythroid precursors and the expression of lineage infidelity markers. When applied in practice, aberrant FCM patterns correlate well with morphology, the subclassification of myelodysplastic syndromes, and prognostic scoring systems. However, the group also concluded that despite strong evidence for an impact of FCM in myelodysplastic syndromes, further (prospective) validation of markers and immunophenotypic patterns are required against control patient groups as well as further standardization in multi-center studies. Standardization of FCM in myelodysplastic syndromes may thus contribute to improved diagnosis and prognostication of myelodysplastic syndromes in the future.","['van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Alhan, Canan', 'Bene, Marie Christine', 'Della Porta, Matteo G', 'Drager, Angelika M', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Font, Patricia', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Homburg, Christa H', 'Ireland, Robin', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Te Marvelde, Jeroen G', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Ogata, Kiyoyuki', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Preijers, Frank W', 'Richards, Stephen J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'Subira, Dolores', 'Valent, Peter', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Westra, August H', 'de Witte, Theo M', 'Wells, Denise A', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Westers, Theresia M']","['van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Alhan C', 'Bene MC', 'Della Porta MG', 'Drager AM', 'Feuillard J', 'Font P', 'Germing U', 'Haase D', 'Homburg CH', 'Ireland R', 'Jansen JH', 'Kern W', 'Malcovati L', 'Te Marvelde JG', 'Mufti GJ', 'Ogata K', 'Orfao A', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Porwit A', 'Preijers FW', 'Richards SJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Subira D', 'Valent P', 'van der Velden VH', 'Vyas P', 'Westra AH', 'de Witte TM', 'Wells DA', 'Loken MR', 'Westers TM']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.vandeloosdrecht@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090622,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Reference Standards']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.005801 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.005801 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Aug;94(8):1124-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.005801.

It is unclear whether the remaining patients have submicroscopic systemic disease and, if so, what is the clinical significance of this finding. PATIENTS AND METHODS Using a flow cytometric method that can detect one T-LL cell among 10,000 normal cells, we examined bone marrow and peripheral-blood samples collected from 99 children with T-LL at diagnosis, as well as blood samples collected from 42 patients during treatment. Results In 71 (71.7%) of the 99 marrow samples obtained at diagnosis, T-LL cells represented 0.01% to 31.6% (median, 0.22%) of mononuclear cells; 57 of the 71 T-LL-positive samples were from patients with stage II/III disease. Results of studies in bilateral marrow aspirates were highly concordant. Two-year event-free survival (EFS) was 68.1% +/- 11.1% (SE) for patients with > or = 1% T-LL cells in bone marrow versus 90.7% +/- 4.4% for those with lower levels of marrow involvement (P = .031); EFS for patients with > or = 5% lymphoblasts was 51.9% +/- 18.0% (P = .009). T-LL cells were as prevalent in blood as in marrow; monitoring residual T-LL cells in blood during remission induction therapy identified patients with slower disease clearance. CONCLUSION More than two thirds of children with T-LL have disseminated disease at diagnosis, a proportion much higher than previously demonstrated. Measurements of disease dissemination at diagnosis might provide useful prognostic information, which can be further refined by monitoring response to therapy through blood testing.","['Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Chen, Helen', 'Chang, Myron', 'Abromowitch, Minnie', 'Campana, Dario']","['Coustan-Smith E', 'Sandlund JT', 'Perkins SL', 'Chen H', 'Chang M', 'Abromowitch M', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U10-CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090622,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/microbiology', 'Child', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*chemistry', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.1318 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.1318 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jul 20;27(21):3533-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.1318.

We show that nucleosome loss and flanking active histone marks define active transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Moreover, these signatures are already set at many inducible genes in quiescent cells prior to cell stimulation. In contrast, there is a dearth of the inactive histone mark H3K9me3 at the TSS, and under-representation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 defines the body of active genes. At the DNA level, cytosine methylation (meC) is enriched for nucleosomes that remain at the TSS, whereas in general there is a dearth of meC at TSSs. Furthermore, a drop in meC also marks 3' transcription termination, and a peak of meC occurs at stop codons. This mimics the 3' nucleosomal distribution in yeast, which we show does not occur in human T cells.","['Smith, Alexander E', 'Chronis, Constantinos', 'Christodoulakis, Manolis', 'Orr, Stephen J', 'Lea, Nicholas C', 'Twine, Natalie A', 'Bhinge, Akshay', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Thomas, N Shaun B']","['Smith AE', 'Chronis C', 'Christodoulakis M', 'Orr SJ', 'Lea NC', 'Twine NA', 'Bhinge A', 'Mufti GJ', 'Thomas NS']","[""King's College London, Department of Haematological Medicine, Leukaemia Sciences Laboratories, Rayne Institute, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090622,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'G1 Phase/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/genetics/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.085530.108 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.085530.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2009 Aug;19(8):1325-37. doi: 10.1101/gr.085530.108.

A pilot study.,92-7,"The frequency of functionally relevant mutations of the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gene in infertile women is significantly enhanced in comparison with fertile controls. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the impact of LIF gene mutations on the outcome of the treatment in women with various causes of infertility. Fifteen infertile women with the G to A transition at position 3400 leading to the valine to methionine exchange at codon 64 were analysed. Group A was made up of women with diagnoses that are frequently accompanied by changes in humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity - idiopathic infertility and endometriosis (N = 7). Group B consisted of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), andrological factor, tubal factor and hyperprolactinaemia (N = 8). The control group comprised 136 infertile women with no LIF gene mutation diagnosed with idiopathic infertility and endometriosis (N = 37) (group C) and patients with PCOS, tubal and andrological factor (N = 99) (group D). Seven of the mutation-positive patients were successfully treated by in vitro fertilization (IVF), but nobody in this group was diagnosed with idiopathic infertility and only one with endometriosis, which means that there is a statistically significant difference in the pregnancy rates between groups A and B (P = 0.01, Fisher's 2 by 2 exact test) but no statistically significant difference when comparing patients with the LIF gene mutation (group A+B) to no LIF gene mutation (group C+D).

The vaccine was applied via spray-immunization to the tonsils of rhesus macaques and compared with systemic regimens. RESULTS: Independent of the application regimen or route, viral loads were significantly reduced after challenge with SIVmac239 (p < 0.03) compared to controls. Considerable amounts of neutralizing antibodies were induced in systemic immunized monkeys. Most of the sera harvested during peak viremia exhibited a trend with an inverse correlation between complement C3-deposition on viral particles and plasma viral load within the different vaccination groups. In contrast, the amount of the observed complement-mediated lysis did not correlate with the reduction of SIV titres. CONCLUSION: The heterologous prime-boost strategy with replication-deficient viral vectors administered exclusively via the tonsils did not induce any neutralizing antibodies before challenge. However, after challenge, comparable SIV-specific humoral immune responses were observed in all vaccinated animals. Immunization with single cycle immunodeficiency viruses mounts humoral immune responses comparable to live-attenuated immunodeficiency virus vaccines.","['Falkensammer, Barbara', 'Rubner, Barbara', 'Hiltgartner, Alexander', 'Wilflingseder, Doris', 'Stahl Hennig, Christiane', 'Kuate, Seraphin', 'Uberla, Klaus', 'Norley, Stephen', 'Strasak, Alexander', 'Racz, Paul', 'Stoiber, Heribert']","['Falkensammer B', 'Rubner B', 'Hiltgartner A', 'Wilflingseder D', 'Stahl Hennig C', 'Kuate S', 'Uberla K', 'Norley S', 'Strasak A', 'Racz P', 'Stoiber H']","['Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Social Medicine, Innsbruck Medical University, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria. barbara.falkensammer@i-med.ac.at']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090621,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Aerosols)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (SAIDS Vaccines)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/genetics', 'Aerosols', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Palatine Tonsil/virology', 'SAIDS Vaccines/*immunology', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*prevention & control', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Load']",2009/06/24 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/24 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-60 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-60 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Jun 21;6:60. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-60.,10.1186/1742-4690-6-60 [doi],PMC2713197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modified methylation specific PCR (MSP) was used to screen p15-M and p15-U mRNA. DNA methyltransferasel (DNMT1), 3A (DNMT3A), 3B (DNMT3B) and p15 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR. P15 protein was detected by Western blotting.

DNMT1 and DNMT3B were inhibited by exposure to PHI for 5 days (P < 0.05). Alteration of DNMT3A was not significant. It is showed that PHI could reverse hypermethylation of gene p15 and transcriptional activation of gene p15 is de novo by PHI.

However, there are no uniform guidelines for infection surveillance. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of bacterial and fungal infections in a single hematology ward and to compare methods for reporting surveillance and infection rates in other centers in Israel. METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance of all patients admitted to our hematology ward, applying standard definitions for invasive fungal infections and adapting definitions for non-fungal infections. Incidence rates were calculated using patients, admissions, hospital days and neutropenia days. We performed a search for other reported surveillance studies in Israel. , RESULTS: We detected 79 infectious episodes among 159 patients admitted to the hematology ward during 1 year. Using neutropenia days as the denominator for calculation of incidence discriminated best between patients at high and low risk for infection. The incidence of invasive fungal infections was 7, 10 and 18 per 1000 neutropenia days, among all patients, those with acute leukemia and those with acute leukemia undergoing induction therapy, respectively. Only 10 reports from Israel were identified, 6 of which were prospective. Our data could not be compared to these reports because of the varying definitions and denominators used.

It has been postulated that ATLL cells might act as regulatory T cells (T(regs)) which, in common with ATLL cells, express both CD25 and FoxP3, and so contribute to the severe immune suppression typical of ATLL. We report here that the frequency of CD25(+) cells varied independently of the frequency of FoxP3(+) cells in both a cross-sectional study and in a longitudinal study of 2 patients with chronic ATLL. Furthermore, the capacity of ATLL cells to suppress proliferation of heterologous CD4(+)CD25(-) cells correlated with the frequency of CD4(+) FoxP3(+) cells but was independent of CD25 expression. Finally, the frequency of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) cells was inversely correlated with the lytic activity of HTLV-1-specific CTLs in patients with ATLL. We conclude that ATLL is not a tumor of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, and that a population of FoxP3(+) cells distinct from ATLL cells has regulatory functions and may impair the cell-mediated immune response to HTLV-1 in patients with ATLL.","['Toulza, Frederic', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Takiguchi, Masafumi', 'Pagliuca, Tony', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Toulza F', 'Nosaka K', 'Takiguchi M', 'Pagliuca T', 'Mitsuya H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR']","['Department of Immunology, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom. f.toulza@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24664 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Nov 15;125(10):2375-82. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24664.,10.1002/ijc.24664 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion gene is usually, but not always, associated with a Philadelphia chromosome, the result of a reciprocal exchange of genetic material between chromosome 22 and chromosome 9, which leads to the production of the activated BCR-ABL1 gene and oncoprotein. The breakpoint in the BCR gene occurs commonly downstream of exons e13 or e14 (M-BCR) and less frequently downstream of exons e1 and e2 (m-BCR). Less than 1% of cases carry a breakpoint downstream of exon 6 or 8 (""variant fusion genes"") or exon 19 (mu-BCR). Breakpoints in the ABL1 gene cluster upstream of exon a2 (or of exon a3 in less than 5% of patients with CML). Conventional cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular testing for the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene are key investigations for the diagnosis and monitoring of CML. Treatment using tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized the management of CML with hematologic and cytogenetic response within 12-18 months observed in >85% of patients. Nevertheless, between 15 and 20% of patients may evolve to blastic phase. Measurement of low level or ""minimal"" residual disease using molecular tests is becoming the gold-standard approach to measure response to therapy due to its higher sensitivity compared to other routine techniques.

We report evidence for a spatially restricted bladder epithelial (urothelial) differentiation program in primary urothelial cancers (UCs) and in UC xenografts. We identified a highly tumorigenic UC cell compartment that resembles benign urothelial stem cells (basal cells), co-expresses the 67-kDa laminin receptor and the basal cell-specific cytokeratin CK17, and lacks the carcinoembryonic antigen family member CEACAM6 (CD66c). This multipotent compartment resides at the tumor-stroma interface, is easily identified on histologic sections, and possesses most, if not all, of the engraftable tumor-forming ability in the parental xenograft. We analyzed differential expression of genes and pathways in basal-like cells versus more differentiated cells. Among these, we found significant enrichment of pathways comprising ""hallmarks"" of cancer, and pharmacologically targetable signaling pathways, including Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, Notch, focal adhesion, mammalian target of rapamycin, epidermal growth factor receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog [ErbB]), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt). The basal/HTC gene expression signature was essentially invisible within the context of nontumorigenic cell gene expression and overlapped significantly with genes driving progression and death in primary human UC. The spatially restricted epithelial differentiation program described here represents a conceptual advance in understanding cellular heterogeneity of carcinomas and identifies basal-like HTCs as attractive targets for cancer therapy.","['He, Xiaobing', 'Marchionni, Luigi', 'Hansel, Donna E', 'Yu, Wayne', 'Sood, Akshay', 'Yang, Jie', 'Parmigiani, Giovanni', 'Matsui, William', 'Berman, David M']","['He X', 'Marchionni L', 'Hansel DE', 'Yu W', 'Sood A', 'Yang J', 'Parmigiani G', 'Matsui W', 'Berman DM']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA088843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA088843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK059375/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072000/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '1U54RR023561-01A1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA107040-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK072000/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK072000-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA077664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA107040/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08DK059375/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA077664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Keratin-17)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratin-17/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Receptors, Laminin/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Urothelium/metabolism/*pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/10/31 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.92 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Jul;27(7):1487-95. doi: 10.1002/stem.92.,10.1002/stem.92 [doi],PMC3060766,['NIHMS236727'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the LIF/STAT3 pathway inhibits commitment to both mesoderm and endoderm lineages is presently unknown. Using a hormone-dependent STAT3 and with microarray analysis, we identified 58 targets of STAT3 including 20 unknown genes. Functional analysis showed that 22 among the 23 STAT3 target genes analyzed contribute to the maintenance of the undifferentiated state, as evidenced by an increase in the frequency of differentiated colonies in a self-renewal assay and a concomitant elevation of early differentiation markers upon knockdown. Fourteen of them, including Dact1, Klf4, Klf5, Rgs16, Smad7, Ccrn4l, Cnnm1, Ocln, Ier3, Pim1, Cyr61, and Sgk, were also regulated by Nanog. Analysis of lineage-specific markers showed that the STAT3 target genes fell into three distinct categories, depending on their capacity to inhibit either mesoderm or endoderm differentiation or both. The identification of genes that harness self-renewal and are downstream targets of both STAT3 and Nanog shed light on the mechanisms underlying functional redundancy between STAT3 and Nanog in mouse embryonic stem cells.","['Bourillot, Pierre-Yves', 'Aksoy, Irene', 'Schreiber, Valerie', 'Wianny, Florence', 'Schulz, Herbert', 'Hummel, Oliver', 'Hubner, Norbert', 'Savatier, Pierre']","['Bourillot PY', 'Aksoy I', 'Schreiber V', 'Wianny F', 'Schulz H', 'Hummel O', 'Hubner N', 'Savatier P']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, U846, Bron, France. pierre.savatier@inserm.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Ectoderm/cytology/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2009/06/23 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.110 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Aug;27(8):1760-71. doi: 10.1002/stem.110.,10.1002/stem.110 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of EpCAM in early development, particularly in stem-like cells, has remained unclear. Here, we show that the maintenance of self-renewal in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells depends on the high-level expression of EpCAM. Cultivation of ES cells under differentiation conditions in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) caused down-regulation of EpCAM along with decreased expression of cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-Myc), Sex-determining region Y-Box 2, Octamer 3/4 (Oct3/4), and Stat3. As a consequence ES cells were morphologically differentiated and ceased to proliferate. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of EpCAM expression under self-renewal conditions resulted in quantitatively decreased proliferation, decreased Oct3/4, SSEA-1, and c-Myc expression, and diminished alkaline phosphatase activity. Conversely, exogenous expression of EpCAM partially compensated for the requirement of ES cells for LIF to retain a stem cell phenotype. Thus, murine EpCAM is a transmembrane protein, which is essential but by itself is not sufficient for maintenance of the ES cell phenotype.","['Gonzalez, Barbara', 'Denzel, Sabine', 'Mack, Brigitte', 'Conrad, Marcus', 'Gires, Olivier']","['Gonzalez B', 'Denzel S', 'Mack B', 'Conrad M', 'Gires O']","['Clinical Cooperation Group Molecular Oncology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, and Head and Neck Research Department, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2009/06/23 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.97 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Aug;27(8):1782-91. doi: 10.1002/stem.97.,10.1002/stem.97 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the function of E-cadherin in mouse ES cell pluripotency and differentiation. We show that inhibition of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact in ES cells using gene knockout (Ecad(-/-)), RNA interference (EcadRNAi), or a transhomodimerization-inhibiting peptide (CHAVC) results in cellular proliferation and maintenance of an undifferentiated phenotype in fetal bovine serum-supplemented medium in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Re-expression of E-cadherin in Ecad(-/-), EcadRNAi, and CHAVC-treated ES cells restores cellular dependence to LIF supplementation. Although reversal of the LIF-independent phenotype in Ecad(-/-) ES cells is dependent on the beta-catenin binding domain of E-cadherin, we show that beta-catenin null (betacat(-/-)) ES cells also remain undifferentiated in the absence of LIF. This suggests that LIF-independent self-renewal of Ecad(-/-) ES cells is unlikely to be via beta-catenin signaling. Exposure of Ecad(-/-), EcadRNAi, and CHAVC-treated ES cells to the activin receptor-like kinase inhibitor SB431542 led to differentiation of the cells, which could be prevented by re-expression of E-cadherin. To confirm the role of transforming growth factor beta family signaling in the self-renewal of Ecad(-/-) ES cells, we show that these cells maintain an undifferentiated phenotype when cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with Activin A and Nodal, with fibroblast growth factor 2 required for cellular proliferation. We conclude that transhomodimerization of E-cadherin protein is required for LIF-dependent ES cell self-renewal and that multiple self-renewal signaling networks subsist in ES cells, with activity dependent upon the cellular context.","['Soncin, Francesca', 'Mohamet, Lisa', 'Eckardt, Dominik', 'Ritson, Sarah', 'Eastham, Angela M', 'Bobola, Nicoletta', 'Russell, Angela', 'Davies, Steve', 'Kemler, Rolf', 'Merry, Catherine L R', 'Ward, Christopher M']","['Soncin F', 'Mohamet L', 'Eckardt D', 'Ritson S', 'Eastham AM', 'Bobola N', 'Russell A', 'Davies S', 'Kemler R', 'Merry CL', 'Ward CM']","['Core Technology Facility, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, and The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nodal Protein)', '0 (activin A)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nodal Protein/pharmacology', 'Protein Multimerization/genetics/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism/physiology']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.134 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Sep;27(9):2069-80. doi: 10.1002/stem.134.,10.1002/stem.134 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the immunity to vaccine preventable diseases in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Sixty-one patients with ALL and 13 healthy siblings were enrolled. Three study groups included newly diagnosed patients (group 1), patients on maintenance chemotherapy (group 2), and patients that completed chemotherapy (group 3). Blood samples for baseline antibody titers were obtained from all the patients and controls. Patients in group 2 were vaccinated with diphtheria, tetanus, and hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Patients in group 3 and controls received the measles vaccine in addition to all the above vaccines. In groups 2 and 3, post-vaccination antibody titers were also obtained. RESULTS: Patients and controls had no Hib vaccine during primary vaccination. After chemotherapy median antibody levels against diphtheria, tetanus, measles, and Hib were decreased but tetanus antibodies were still at the protective levels. Proportions of the patients with protective levels were 11.1%, 83.3%, 16.7%, and 16.7% for diphtheria, tetanus, Hib, and measles, respectively. Vaccination achieved protective antibody levels in 81%, 100%, 89.5%, and 70% of the patients for diphtheria, tetanus, Hib, and measles, respectively. Vaccine responses during maintenance were also satisfying. CONCLUSION: We recommend re-vaccination after 3 months of cessation of chemotherapy. Administration of Hib vaccine may be beneficial after the first 3 months of maintenance chemotherapy especially in children with no primary vaccination followed by a second booster dose after cessation of therapy to increase immunity.","['Zengin, Emine', 'Sarper, Nazan']","['Zengin E', 'Sarper N']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Kocaeli University, School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Bacterial Vaccines)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibody Formation', 'Bacterial Vaccines/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria/immunology', 'Haemophilus influenzae type b/immunology', 'Humans', 'Measles/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Tetanus/immunology', 'Vaccination/*methods', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22135 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):967-72. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22135.,10.1002/pbc.22135 [doi],,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):922-3.

To date, no extensive industrial hygiene exposure analyses for historical benzene exposure have been performed, and none have focused on the airborne concentrations in the workplace at specific refineries or for specific tasks. In this study, the authors evaluated the airborne concentrations of benzene and their variability over time at the ExxonMobil refinery in Baton Rouge between 1977 and 2005. Refinery workers were categorized into 117 worker groups using company job descriptions. These 117 groups were further collapsed into 25 job categories based on similarity of measured exposure results. Results of 5289 personal air samples are included in this analysis; 3403 were considered nontask (>or= 180 min) personal samples, and 830 were considered task-related (< 180 min) personal samples; the remainder did not fit in either category. In general, nontask personal air samples indicated that exposures of the past 30 years were generally below the occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm, but there was only a small, decreasing temporal trend in the concentrations. The job sampled most frequently during routine operations was process technician and, as broken down by area, resulted in the following mean benzene concentrations: analyzers (mean = 0.12 ppm), coker (mean = 0.013 ppm), hydrofiner (mean = 0.0054 ppm), lube blending and storage (mean = 0.010 ppm), waste treatment (mean = 0.092 ppm), and all other areas (mean = 0.055 ppm). Task-based samples indicated that the highest exposures resulted from the sampling tasks, specifically from those performed on process materials; in general, though, even these tasks had concentrations well below the STEL of 5 ppm. The most frequently sampled task was gauging (mean = 0.12 ppm). Task-related exposures were also similar across job categories for a given task, with a few exceptions.

Its antineoplastic activity toward malignant cells is due to their characteristic nature in slow synthesis of L-asparagine (Asn), which causes starvation for this amino acid, while normal cells are protected from Asn starvation due to their ability to produce this amino acid. The relative selectivity with regard to the metabolism of malignant cells forces to look for novel asparaginase with little glutaminase-producing systems compared to existing enzyme. In this investigation, the role of the extracellular asparaginase enzyme produced by an isolated bacterial strain was studied. Biochemical characterization denoted that this isolated bacterial strain belongs to the Bacillus circulans species. The strain was tested for L-asparaginase production, and it was observed that, under an optimized environment, this isolate produces a maximum of 85 IU ml(-1) within 24-h incubation. This enzyme showed less (60%) glutaminase activity compared to commercial Erwinia sp. L-asparaginase. The partially purified enzyme showed an approximate molecular weight of 140 kDa. This enzyme potency in terms of antineoplastic activity was analyzed against the cancer cells, CCRF-CEM.

The parallel multichannel acquisition of the fluorescence signal was accomplished by using a single line of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera at 14 mus time resolution for detection of the fluorescence signal. The STFM system provided fast confocal imaging (30 images per second) and allowed for the spatially resolved detection of particle concentration fluctuations in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments. For the application of the STFM, an approximated theoretical description of the beam geometry, the point-spread function, and the fluorescence auto- and cross-correlation functions were derived. The STFM was applied to studies of the dynamics of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, green fluorescent protein, and chromatin-remodeling complexes in living cells.

Sixty-one patients (median age, 33.6 yr) with relapsed or refractory AML were treated with the FLAG regimen that consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2), days 1-5), cytarabine (2.0 g/m(2), days 1-5) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Of the treated patients 29 patients (47.5%) achieved complete remission (CR). Higher CR rates were observed for patients with a first or second relapse as compared to patients with a primary refractory response or relapse after stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There was a significant difference in the response rates according to the duration of leukemia-free survival (pre-LFS) before chemotherapy (P=0.05). The recovery time of both neutrophils (> or =500/microL) and platelets (> or =20,000/microL) required a median of 21 and 18 days, respectively. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) occurred in seven patients (11.4%), of which 71.4% of TRM was caused by an invasive aspergillosis infection. After achieving CR, 18 patients underwent consolidation chemotherapy and six patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. In conclusion, FLAG chemotherapy without idarubicin is a relatively effective and well-tolerated regimen for relapsed or refractory AML and the use of FLAG chemotherapy has allowed intensive post-remission therapy including HSCT.","['Lee, Se Ryeon', 'Yang, Deok Hwan', 'Ahn, Jae Sook', 'Kim, Yeo Kyeoung', 'Lee, Je Jung', 'Choi, Young Jin', 'Shin, Ho Jin', 'Chung, Joo Seop', 'Cho, Yoon Young', 'Chae, Yee Soo', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Kim, Hyeoung Joon']","['Lee SR', 'Yang DH', 'Ahn JS', 'Kim YK', 'Lee JJ', 'Choi YJ', 'Shin HJ', 'Chung JS', 'Cho YY', 'Chae YS', 'Kim JG', 'Sohn SK', 'Kim HJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Center, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090615,Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2008/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2009.24.3.498 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2009 Jun;24(3):498-503. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2009.24.3.498.

Also, we compared the methylation status of genes in AML and CML using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The frequencies of DNA methylation of ID4, SFRP1, and SHP1 were higher in AML patients compared to those in CML patients. In contrast, no statistical difference between AML and CML was detected for other genes such as DLC-1, DAB2IP, H-cadherin, Integrin alpha4, and RUNX3.

The gene Prkg2, encoding cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase II, cGKII, was tagged by retroviral insertions in two brain tumors. The insertions were both situated upstream of the kinase domain and suggested creating a truncated form of the cGKII protein. We transfected different human glioma cell lines with Prkg2 and found an overall reduction in colony formation and cell proliferation compared with controls transfected with truncated Prkg2 (lacking the kinase domain) or empty vector. All glioma cells transfected with the cGKII phosphorylate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, VASP, after cGMP analog treatment. Glioma cell lines positive for the Sox9 transcription factor showed reduced Sox9 expression when Prkg2 was stably transfected. When cGKII was activated by cGMP analog treatment, Sox9 was phosphorylated, Sox9 protein expression was suppressed and the glioma cell lines displayed loss of cell adhesion, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and G1 arrest. Sox9 repression by siRNA was similarly shown to reduce glioma cell proliferation. Expression analysis of stem and glial lineage cell markers also suggests that cGKII induces differentiation of glioma cell lines. These findings describe an anti-proliferative role of cGKII in human glioma biology and would further explain the retroviral tagging of the cGKII gene during brain tumor formation in PDGF-induced tumors.","['Swartling, F J', 'Ferletta, M', 'Kastemar, M', 'Weiss, W A', 'Westermark, B']","['Swartling FJ', 'Ferletta M', 'Kastemar M', 'Weiss WA', 'Westermark B']","['Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA097257-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097257-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097257-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097257-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097257-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097257/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090622,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (SOX9 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (PRKG2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Prkg2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009168 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.168 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Sep 3;28(35):3121-31. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.168.

Overexpression of BMI1 is associated with poor prognosis in several human cancers, including breast cancer. We have previously shown that BMI1 collaborates with H-RAS to induce transformation of MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells through dysregulation of multiple growth pathways independent of the INK4A/ARF locus. In this study, we show that BMI1 collaborates with H-RAS to promote increased proliferation, invasion and resistance to apoptosis in vitro, and an increased rate of spontaneous metastases from mammary fat pad xenografts including novel metastases to the brain. Furthermore, in collaboration with H-RAS, BMI1 induced fulminant metastatic disease in the lung using a tail vein model of haematogenous spread through accelerated cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Finally, we show that knockdown of BMI1 in several established breast cancer cell lines leads to decreased oncogenic behaviour in vitro and in vivo. In summary, BMI1 collaborates with H-RAS to induce an aggressive and metastatic phenotype with the unusual occurrence of brain metastasis, making it an important target for diagnosis and treatment of aggressive breast cancer.","['Hoenerhoff, M J', 'Chu, I', 'Barkan, D', 'Liu, Z-y', 'Datta, S', 'Dimri, G P', 'Green, J E']","['Hoenerhoff MJ', 'Chu I', 'Barkan D', 'Liu ZY', 'Datta S', 'Dimri GP', 'Green JE']","['Transgenic Oncogenesis Group, Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20982, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA094150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC005740-15/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA 094150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090622,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009165 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.165 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Aug 27;28(34):3022-32. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.165.

As suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are potent feedback inhibitors of Jak-mediated signaling, we investigated their role in signal transduction through constitutively active Jak2 mutants. We selected two mutants, Jak2-V617F and Jak2-K539L, found in patients with MPDs and Jak2-T875N identified in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We found SOCS family members to be induced through Jak2-V617F in human leukemia cell lines expressing the mutant allele and in stable HEK transfectants inducibly expressing constitutively active Jak2 mutants. SOCS proteins were recruited to the membrane and bound to the constitutively active Jaks. In contrast to wild-type Jak2, the mutant proteins were constitutively ubiquitinated and degraded through the proteasome. Taken together, we show a SOCS-mediated downregulation of the constitutively active, disease-associated mutant Jak2 proteins. Furthermore, a threshold level of mutant Jak expression has to be overcome to allow full cytokine-independent constitutive activation of signaling proteins, which may explain progression to homozygocity in MPDs as well as gene amplification in severe phenotypes and leukemia.","['Haan, S', 'Wuller, S', 'Kaczor, J', 'Rolvering, C', 'Nocker, T', 'Behrmann, I', 'Haan, C']","['Haan S', 'Wuller S', 'Kaczor J', 'Rolvering C', 'Nocker T', 'Behrmann I', 'Haan C']","['Life Sciences Research Unit, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg. serge.haan@uni.lu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090622,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009155 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.155 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Aug 27;28(34):3069-80. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.155.

It displayed a chimeric envelope protein containing a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody to the HER2 receptor and carried the mouse IL-12 gene. The fragment of anti-erbB2scFv was constructed into the proline-rich region of the viral envelope of the packaging vector lacking a transmembrane subunit of the carboxyl terminal region of surface subunit. As compared with envelope-unmodified gammaretroviruses, envelope-modified ones had extended viral tropism to human HER2-expressing bladder cancer cell lines, induced apoptosis, and affected cell cycle progression despite lower viral titers. Moreover, animal studies showed that envelope-modified gammaretroviruses carrying IL-12 gene exerted higher antitumor activity in terms of retarding tumor growth and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing mice than unmodified ones, which were associated with enhanced tumor cell apoptosis as well as increased intratumoral levels of IL-12, interferon-gamma, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha proteins. Therefore, the antitumor activity of gammaretroviruses carrying the IL-12 gene was enhanced through genetic modification of the envelope targeting HER2 receptor, which may be a promising strategy for bladder cancer therapy.","['Tsai, Y-S', 'Shiau, A-L', 'Chen, Y-F', 'Tsai, H-T', 'Tzai, T-S', 'Wu, C-L']","['Tsai YS', 'Shiau AL', 'Chen YF', 'Tsai HT', 'Tzai TS', 'Wu CL']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Medical College, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*methods', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*therapy/*virology', 'Viral Tropism']",2009/06/23 09:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt200941 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2009.41 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2010 Jan;17(1):37-48. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2009.41.,10.1038/cgt.2009.41 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Rbm15 has been reported to be required for B-cell differentiation and to inhibit myeloid and megakaryocytic expansion, it is not clear what the normal functions of Rbm15 are in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and megakaryocyte development. In this study, we report that Rbm15 may function in part through regulation of expression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc. Similar to c-Myc knockout (c-Myc-KO) mice, long-term (LT) HSCs are significantly increased in Rbm15-KO mice due to an apparent LT-HSC to short-term HSC differentiation defect associated with abnormal HSC-niche interactions caused by increased N-cadherin and beta(1) integrin expression on mutant HSCs. Both serial transplantation and competitive reconstitution capabilities of Rbm15-KO LT-HSCs are greatly compromised. Rbm15-KO and c-Myc-KO mice also share related abnormalities in megakaryocyte development, with mutant progenitors producing increased, abnormally small low-ploidy megakaryocytes. Consistent with a possible functional interplay between Rbm15 and c-Myc, the megakaryocyte increase in Rbm15-KO mice could be partially reversed by ectopic c-Myc. Thus, Rbm15 appears to be required for normal HSC-niche interactions, for the ability of HSCs to contribute normally to adult hematopoiesis, and for normal megakaryocyte development; these effects of Rbm15 on hematopoiesis may be mediated at least in part by c-Myc.","['Niu, Chao', 'Zhang, Jiwang', 'Breslin, Peter', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Ma, Zhigui', 'Morris, Stephan Wade']","['Niu C', 'Zhang J', 'Breslin P', 'Onciu M', 'Ma Z', 'Morris SW']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Pl., Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],['CA21675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090619,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Rbm15 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Ploidies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36977-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-197921 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 3;114(10):2087-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-197921.

In this study, we examined its possible modes of action for antileukemic effects on FLT3-activated, FLT3 wild-type, or imatinib-resistant leukemia cells. KW-2449 showed the potent growth inhibitory effects on leukemia cells with FLT3 mutations by inhibition of the FLT3 kinase, resulting in the down-regulation of phosphorylated-FLT3/STAT5, G(1) arrest, and apoptosis. Oral administration of KW-2449 showed dose-dependent and significant tumor growth inhibition in FLT3-mutated xenograft model with minimum bone marrow suppression. In FLT3 wild-type human leukemia, it induced the reduction of phosphorylated histone H3, G(2)/M arrest, and apoptosis. In imatinib-resistant leukemia, KW-2449 contributed to release of the resistance by the simultaneous down-regulation of BCR/ABL and Aurora kinases. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of KW-2449 was confirmed in primary samples from AML and imatinib-resistant patients. The inhibitory activity of KW-2449 is not affected by the presence of human plasma protein, such as alpha1-acid glycoprotein. These results indicate KW-2449 has potent growth inhibitory activity against various types of leukemia by several mechanisms of action. Our studies indicate KW-2449 has significant activity and warrants clinical study in leukemia patients with FLT3 mutations as well as imatinib-resistant mutations.","['Shiotsu, Yukimasa', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Tanizaki, Ryohei', 'Shimizu, Makiko', 'Umehara, Hiroshi', 'Ishii, Kenichi', 'Mori, Yumiko', 'Ozeki, Kazutaka', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Maeda, Hiroshi', 'Akiyama, Tadakazu', 'Kanda, Yutaka', 'Sato, Yuko', 'Akinaga, Shiro', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Shiotsu Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Tanizaki R', 'Shimizu M', 'Umehara H', 'Ishii K', 'Mori Y', 'Ozeki K', 'Minami Y', 'Abe A', 'Maeda H', 'Akiyama T', 'Kanda Y', 'Sato Y', 'Akinaga S', 'Naoe T']","['Fuji Research Park, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Shizuoka, Japan. yukimasa.shiotsu@kyowa-kirin.co.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (KW 2449)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology', 'Isoleucine/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation, Missense/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics', 'Threonine/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37186-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-199307 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 20;114(8):1607-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-199307.

High expression levels of ZAP-70 or CD38 and deletions of 17p13 (TP53) and 11q22-q23 (ATM) are associated with poorer overall survival and shorter time to disease progression. DNA damage and p53 play a pivotal role in apoptosis induction in response to conventional chemotherapy, because deletions of ATM or p53 identify CLL patients with resistance to treatment. Forodesine is a transition-state inhibitor of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase with antileukemic activity. We show that forodesine is highly cytotoxic as single agent or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in primary leukemic cells from CLL patients regardless of CD38/ZAP-70 expression and p53 or ATM deletion. Forodesine activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the levels of antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein and induction of proapoptotic BIM protein. Forodesine induces transcriptional up-regulation of p73, a p53-related protein able to overcome the resistance to apoptosis of CLL cells lacking functional p53. Remarkably, no differences in these apoptotic markers were observed based on p53 or ATM status. In conclusion, forodesine induces apoptosis of CLL cells bypassing the DNA-damage/ATM/p53 pathway and might represent a novel chemotherapeutic approach that deserves clinical investigation.","['Alonso, Roberto', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Upshaw, Ramanda', 'Bantia, Shanta', 'Smal, Caroline', 'Bontemps, Francoise', 'Manz, Chantal', 'Mehrling, Thomas', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Campo, Elias', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Alonso R', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Upshaw R', 'Bantia S', 'Smal C', 'Bontemps F', 'Manz C', 'Mehrling T', 'Villamor N', 'Campo E', 'Montserrat E', 'Colomer D']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/physiology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37182-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-207654 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 20;114(8):1563-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-207654.

Promising evidence has been reported for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia as well as a number of other previously difficult to treat cancers. Drug combination approaches have also shown promise for the treatment of mood disorders including bipolar disorder and depression. In addition to these drug combination approaches, HDACIs alone have demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Rett syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Adverse inflammatory affects observed with traumatic brain injury and arthritis have also been alleviated by treatment with certain HDACIs.

The presenting manifestations consist of splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and characteristic monocyte depletion. The presence in peripheral blood or bone marrow of hairy cells exhibiting the CD19(+) CD20(+) CD25(+) CD11c(+) phenotype establishes the diagnosis. Rarely, patients present with inaugural joint manifestations related either to the hematological malignancy or to immune dysfunction. The resulting polymorphic polyarticular symptoms may cause diagnostic wanderings. Monocytopenia is a valuable diagnostic clue. The identification of hairy cells in the joint fluid establishes the diagnosis of leukemia-related arthritis. The treatment rests on purine analogs.

FcvarepsilonRI-induced mast cell activation was analyzed at a single cell basis using a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line transfected with a reporter plasmid containing three tandem NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) binding sites fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Surprisingly, with this sensitive detection system, there is activation of IgE sensitized cells at concentrations of antigen as low as 10pg/ml, which was 10-fold lower than was detected by degranulation. There were differences in signaling pathways leading to degranulation compared to NFAT-mediated gene activation. Both signaling to NFAT activation and degranulation required Syk and calcineurin. However inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway blocked degranulation but did not NFAT activation. The results also indicate that NFAT was activated at lower intracellular signals compared to degranulation. Therefore, FcvarepsilonRI activation can result in nuclear signals in the absence of the release of mediators.","['Grodzki, Ana Cristina G', 'Moon, Kyungduk D', 'Berenstein, Elsa H', 'Siraganian, Reuben P']","['Grodzki AC', 'Moon KD', 'Berenstein EH', 'Siraganian RP']","['Oral Infection and Immunity Branch, National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States.']",['eng'],"['Z01 DE000696-09/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 DE999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090621,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(09)00229-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2009.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2009 Aug;46(13):2539-47. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.05.013.

We screened a library of 2000 marketed drugs and naturally occurring compounds to identify agents that potentiate the cytotoxic effects of ATO in leukemic cells. Here, we report the identification of three isothiocyanates (sulforaphane, erysolin and erucin) found in cruciferous vegetables as enhancers of ATO cytotoxicity. Both erysolin and sulforaphane significantly enhanced ATO-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a panel of leukemic cell lines; erucin activity was variable among cell types. Cellular exposure to sulforaphane in combination with ATO resulted in a dramatic increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to treatment with either agent alone. Sulforaphane, alone or with ATO, decreased intracellular glutathione (GSH) content. Furthermore, addition of the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) rescued cells from ATO/isothiocyanate-mediated cytotoxicity. Our data suggest that isothiocyanates enhance the cytotoxic effects of ATO through a ROS-dependent mechanism. Combinatorial treatment with isothiocyanates and ATO might provide a promising therapeutic approach for a variety of myeloid malignancies.","['Doudican, Nicole A', 'Bowling, Benjamin', 'Orlow, Seth J']","['Doudican NA', 'Bowling B', 'Orlow SJ']","['NYU School of Medicine, Departments of Dermatology and Cell Biology, New York, NY 10016, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR041880-12/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR041880/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR41880/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR041880-14/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AR050645/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AR050645-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR041880-11/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR041880-13/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090621,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '504-84-7 (erysolin)', 'CTE370DL3U (erucin)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfides/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vegetables/chemistry']",2009/06/23 09:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00266-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.05.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Feb;34(2):229-34. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.05.017.

In the context of cancer, detailed signaling studies have resulted in the development of some of the most frequently used means of therapy, with several well established examples such as the small molecule inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Impaired function of receptor tyrosine kinases is implicated in various types of tumors, and much effort is put into mapping the many interactions and downstream pathways. Here we discuss the hematopoietic growth factor receptors c-Kit and Flt3 and their downstream signaling in normal as well as malignant cells. Both receptors are members of the same family of tyrosine kinases and crucial mediators of stem-and progenitor-cell proliferation and survival in response to ligand stimuli from the surrounding microenvironment. Gain-of-function mutations/alterations render the receptors constitutively and ligand-independently activated, resulting in aberrant signaling which is a crucial driving force in tumorigenesis. Frequently found mutations in c-Kit and Flt3 are point mutations of aspartic acid 816 and 835 respectively, in the activation loop of the kinase domains. Several other point mutations have been identified, but in the case of Flt3, the most common alterations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane region, reported in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the last couple of years, the increasing understanding of c-Kit and Flt3 signaling has also revealed the complexity of these receptor systems. The impact of gain-of-function mutations of c-Kit and Flt3 in different malignancies is well established and shown to be of clinical relevance in both prognosis and therapy. Many inhibitors of both c-Kit or Flt3 or of their downstream substrates are in clinical trials with encouraging results, and targeted therapy using a combination of such inhibitors is considered a promising approach for future treatments.","['Masson, Kristina', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Masson K', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Wallenberg Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, Lund University, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090618,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/06/23 09:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00187-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Dec;21(12):1717-26. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.06.002.

A target dose of yielded CD34+ is usually prescribed by the attending physician depending on different protocols, which may include single or double transplantation. HSC collection usually is performed when at least 20 CD34+ HSC/microL are detected by means of flow cytometry. A cumulative dose of at least 2 x 10(6)/Kg/bw CD34+ HSC has been considered as the threshold to allow a prompt and persistent hematopoietic recovery. Unfortunately, this goal is not achieved by the totality of patients undergoing mobilization regimen. In fact, 5-46% of patients who underwent mobilization therapy fail HSC collection due to very low peripheral blood HSC CD34+ count. Patients' characteristics, including age, sex, stage of the underlying disease (complete or partial remission), diagnosis, previously administered radio/chemotherapy regimens, time-lapse from last chemotherapy before mobilization and mobilization schedule (including dose of GF) were considered as possibly predictive of poor or failed mobilization. We performed a retrospective analysis in 2177 patients from three large Italian academic institutions to assess the incidence of poor mobilizers within our patients' series. Therefore, a patient who fails a first mobilization (and when an HLA-compatible related on unrelated donor is not available) could undergo a second attempt either with different mobilization schedule or by using different GF, such as stem cell factor, growth hormone (GH), or more recently newly introduced drugs such as AMD3100, alone or in combination with rHuG- or -rHuGM-CSF.

In this study, we investigated whether VPA influences CXCR4 in CD34-negative AML cell lines (promyelocytic HL-60 and monocytic THP-1), as well as both CD34-positive and CD34-negative primary AML cells. We found that VPA (i) diminishes CXCR4 expression and chemotaxis in HL-60 cells and in the CD34-negative subtypes of primary AML cells and (ii) increases CXCR4 expression and function in the highly CD34-positive subtypes of primary AML cells.

In this study, we analysed two new prognostic indexes proposed by the MDACC and GIMEMA group in a random population of B-CCL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A follow up study of a cohort of patients was carried out. 265 B-CLL patients diagnosed in the Area Sanitaria de Gijon during 10 years (1997-2007) were analysed in this study. The overall survival of the patients was analysed by the Rai and Binet staging systems and the prognostic indexes proposed by the MDACC and GIMEMA group. RESULTS: The crude rate was 8.99 per 100.000 populations for year and the adjusted-age rate was 3.47 per 100.000 populations for year. The distribution of patients based on the MDACC index was: 31.4% had low risk, 62% had intermediate risk and 6.6% had high risk. The percentage of 5- and 10-years survival probabilities were 87% and 73% for low risk, 75% and 49% for intermediate risk and 29% and 16% of high risk. The GIMEMA index was unable to predict the overall survival in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of B-CLL are higher in our population than previously described, which is probably caused by an earlier diagnosis. Our results indicate that the MDACC prognostic index predicted the overall survival and the prognosis of a random population of patients better than the classical staging systems. The simplicity and utility of this prognostic index may help clinicians in clinical decision and therapeutical management.","['Gonzalez Rodriguez, Ana Pilar', 'Gonzalez Garcia, Esther', 'Fernandez Alvarez, Carmen', 'Gonzalez Huerta, Ana Julia', 'Gonzalez Rodriguez, Segundo']","['Gonzalez Rodriguez AP', 'Gonzalez Garcia E', 'Fernandez Alvarez C', 'Gonzalez Huerta AJ', 'Gonzalez Rodriguez S']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Cabuenes, Gijon, Asturias, Espana. anapilar.gonzalez@sespa.princast.es']",['spa'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090618,Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/10/03 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2008/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-7753(09)00851-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medcli.2008.09.046 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2009 Jul 4;133(5):161-6. doi: 10.1016/j.medcli.2008.09.046.

We assessed whether single and multiple minor mHAg mismatches are associated with outcomes in 730 unrelated donor, HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 allele-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) between 1996 and 2003. Patients had acute and chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), received myeloablative conditioning regimens and calcineurin inhibitor-based graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and most received bone marrow (BM; 85%). Donor and recipient DNA samples were genotyped for mHAg including: HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1 and CD31(125/563). Primary outcomes included grades III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and survival; secondary outcomes included chronic GVHD (cGVHD), engraftment, and relapse. Single disparities at HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, and HB-1 were not significantly associated with any of the outcomes analyzed. In HLA-A2-positive individuals, single CD31(563) or multiple mHAg mismatches in the HVG vector were associated with lower risk of grades III-IV aGVHD. Based on these data, we conclude that mHAg incompatibility at HA-1, HA-2, HA-3, HA-8, HB-1, and CD31 has no detectable effect on the outcome of HLA matched unrelated donor HSCT.","['Spellman, Stephen', 'Warden, Melissa B', 'Haagenson, Michael', 'Pietz, Bradley C', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Warren, Edus H', 'Wang, Tao', 'Ellis, Thomas M']","['Spellman S', 'Warden MB', 'Haagenson M', 'Pietz BC', 'Goulmy E', 'Warren EH', 'Wang T', 'Ellis TM']","['National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN 55413, USA. sspellma@nmdp.org']",['eng'],"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00162-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Jul;15(7):856-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.03.018.,10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.03.018 [doi],PMC2721718,['NIHMS128157'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This damage contributes to spontaneous mutation and cancer. DNA adducts can be measured with high sensitivity, with limits of detection lower than one adduct per one billion nucleotides. Minute exposures to an exogenous DNA-reactive agent may therefore result in measurable adduct formation, although, as an increment over total DNA damage, a small increment in mutation cannot be measured and would be considered negligible. Here, we investigated whether this discrepancy also holds for adducts that are present as background induced by oxidative stress. L5178Y tk(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells were incubated for 4h with hydrogen peroxide (0, 0.8, 4, 20, 100, 500muM) or cumene hydroperoxide (0, 0.37, 1.1, 3.3, 10muM). Five endpoints of genotoxicity were measured in parallel from aliquots of three replicates of large batches of cells: Two DNA adducts, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) and 1,N(6)-etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine (varepsilondAdo) measured by LC-MS/MS, as well as strand breaks assessed with the comet assay and in vitro micronucleus test, and gene mutation as assessed using the thymidine kinase gene mutation assay. Background measures of 8-oxodGuo and varepsilondAdo were 500-1000 and 50-90 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides. Upon treatment, neither hydrogen peroxide nor cumene hydroperoxide significantly increased the DNA adduct levels above control. In contrast, dose-related increases above background were observed with both oxidants in the comet assay, the micronucleus test and the gene mutation assay. Differences in sensitivity of the assays were quantified by estimating the concentration of oxidant that resulted in a doubling of the background measure. We conclude that the increase in DNA breakage and mutation induced by hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide observed in our in vitro experimental set-up was no direct consequence of the measured DNA adducts. In comparison with data obtained with the methylating agent methyl methanesulfonate we further conclude that the assumption of DNA adducts being oversensitive biomarkers is adduct-specific.","['Brink, Andreas', 'Richter, Ingrid', 'Lutz, Ursula', 'Wanek, Paul', 'Stopper, Helga', 'Lutz, Werner K']","['Brink A', 'Richter I', 'Lutz U', 'Wanek P', 'Stopper H', 'Lutz WK']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Strasse 9, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090616,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'PG7JD54X4I (cumene hydroperoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene Derivatives/toxicity', 'Biomarkers/analysis', '*DNA Adducts', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress']",2009/06/23 09:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(09)00202-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 Aug;678(2):123-8. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.06.001.

Recently, attention has focused on the estrogen-like and carcinogenic adverse effects of BPA. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity of this compound. METHODS: Cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation analyses; western blots. RESULTS: BPA is able to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in three different acute myeloid leukemias. Although some granulocytic differentiation concomitantly occurred in NB4 cells upon BPA treatment, the major action was the induction of apoptosis. BPA mediated apoptosis was caspase dependent and occurred by activation of extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways modulating both FAS and TRAIL and by inducing BAD phosphorylation in NB4 cells. Finally, also non genomic actions such as the early decrease of both ERK and AKT phosphorylation were induced by BPA thus indicating that a complex intersection of regulations occur for the apoptotic action of BPA. CONCLUSION: BPA is able to induce apoptosis in leukemia cells via caspase activation and involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis.","['Bontempo, Paola', 'Mita, Luigi', 'Doto, Antonella', 'Miceli, Marco', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Lepore, Ilaria', 'Franci, GianLuigi', 'Menafra, Roberta', 'Carafa, Vincenzo', 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'De Bellis, Floriana', 'Manzo, Fabio', 'Di Cerbo, Vincenzo', 'Benedetti, Rosaria', ""D'Amato, Loredana"", 'Marino, Maria', 'Bolli, Alessandro', 'Del Pozzo, Giovanna', 'Diano, Nadia', 'Portaccio, Marianna', 'Mita, Gustavo D', 'Vietri, Maria Teresa', 'Cioffi, Michele', 'Nola, Ernesto', ""Dell'aversana, Carmela"", 'Sica, Vincenzo', 'Molinari, Anna Maria', 'Altucci, Lucia']","['Bontempo P', 'Mita L', 'Doto A', 'Miceli M', 'Nebbioso A', 'Lepore I', 'Franci G', 'Menafra R', 'Carafa V', 'Conte M', 'De Bellis F', 'Manzo F', 'Di Cerbo V', 'Benedetti R', ""D'Amato L"", 'Marino M', 'Bolli A', 'Del Pozzo G', 'Diano N', 'Portaccio M', 'Mita GD', 'Vietri MT', 'Cioffi M', 'Nola E', ""Dell'aversana C"", 'Sica V', 'Molinari AM', 'Altucci L']","['Dipartimento di Patologia generale, Seconda Universita di Napoli, Via L, De Crecchio 7, Napoli, Italy. paola.bontempo@unina2.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090618,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'MLT3645I99 (bisphenol A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'CD11c Antigen/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-7-48 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-7-48 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2009 Jun 18;7:48. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-7-48.,10.1186/1479-5876-7-48 [doi],PMC2717713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antifolate methotrexate is widely used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. Even when given identical methotrexate doses, patients vary significantly in their response and pattern of toxicities. This diversity can, to some extent, be linked to sequence variations in genes involved in drug absorption, metabolism, excretion, cellular transport, and effector targets or target pathways. In the coming years pharmacogenomics is expected to change our approaches to individualised therapy with methotrexate. However, genetic polymorphisms affect the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of all the drugs a patient receive as well as the normal tissues tolerance to a given drug exposure. Thus, although high-throughput techniques will allow mapping of tens of thousands of genetic polymorphisms in one run, it will be a major challenge to dissect out which of these have the strongest impact on efficacy and toxicity and hence should be the targets for intervention.

Many peanut allergens have been characterized using, in particular, IgE-binding studies. OBJECTIVES: We optimized an in vitro functional assay to assess the capacity of peanut allergens to degranulate humanized rat basophilic leukaemia cells, RBL SX-38 cells, after sensitization by serum IgE from peanut-allergic patients. We thus compared the activity of the main peanut allergens, i.e. Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6, purified from roasted peanut. METHODS: Sera of 12 peanut-allergic patients were collected and total and peanut-specific IgE were measured. They were used to sensitize RBL SX-38 cells and the degranulation was induced by incubation with ranging concentrations of a whole peanut protein extract or of purified peanut allergens. The mediator release was quantified by the determination of beta-hexosaminidase activity in the supernatant. The intensity of the degranulation was expressed as maximum release and as EC50, corresponding to the dose of allergen that induced 50% of the maximum release. RESULTS: For each serum, only 10 IU/mL of human IgE was necessary to sensitize the cells and obtain an optimal degranulation. With all the allergens, the release was positively correlated with the concentration of allergen-specific IgE in the serum used to sensitize the cells. The medians of EC50 obtained for Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 were 2.1 and 2.8 pm, respectively, while they were much higher for Ara h 3 and Ara h 1 (65 and 150 pm, respectively). CONCLUSION: The RBL SX-38 release assay proved to be sensitive, specific and reproducible. It allowed the comparison of the degranulation potential of different peanut allergens. For all the sera tested, Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 were more potent than Ara h 1 or Ara h 3.","['Blanc, F', 'Adel-Patient, K', 'Drumare, M-F', 'Paty, E', 'Wal, J-M', 'Bernard, H']","['Blanc F', 'Adel-Patient K', 'Drumare MF', 'Paty E', 'Wal JM', 'Bernard H']","[""INRA, UR496, Unite d'Immuno-Allergie Alimentaire, Gif sur Yvette, Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090615,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (2S Albumins, Plant)', '0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Ara h 2 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Ara h 6 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['2S Albumins, Plant/blood/*immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Allergens/blood/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant/blood/*immunology', '*Basophil Degranulation Test', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Male', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/blood/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CEA3294 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03294.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2009 Aug;39(8):1277-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03294.x.

However, the relationship of MUTZ-3 DC to their non-transformed counterparts remains incompletely understood. Immunoselected CD14+ MUTZ-3 cells were used to generate a homogeneous population of DC (M3DC). These cells had a cell surface phentoype and morphology characteristic of conventional monocyte-derived DC (MDDC). Whole genome transcriptome comparison of M3DC and MDDC however, revealed extensive differences between these two cell types. Functional ontology-based data analysis revealed three enriched clusters of genes downregulated in M3DC, with functions in pathogen recognition, DC maturation and cytokine/chemokine signalling. Downregulation of protein expression was confirmed for several of these genes. The molecular differences were accompanied by a profoundly impaired phenotypic and functional response of M3DC to microbial stimulation. The immortalized phenotype of MUTZ-3 therefore reflects not only deregulated proliferative capacity, but substantial perturbation of normal antigen-presenting cell function. These results have important implications for studies using MUTZ-3 as a model of MDDC or for cancer immunotherapy.","['Rasaiyaah, Jane', 'Noursadeghi, Mahdad', 'Kellam, Paul', 'Chain, Benjamin']","['Rasaiyaah J', 'Noursadeghi M', 'Kellam P', 'Chain B']","['Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['077161/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)'],IM,"['Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Multigene Family/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']","['IMM3018 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03018.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2009 Jul;127(3):429-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03018.x.,10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03018.x [doi],PMC2712111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, the WT1 protein was shown to be highly immunogenic in cancer patients. WT1 peptides that could induce WT1-specific CTLs (WT1 CTL peptides) were identified, and vaccination of cancer patients with these WT1 CTL peptides induced immunological responses, which were assessed by ex vivo immuno-monitoring, such as the tetramer assay, and in vivo immuno-monitoring, such as the peptide-specific delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. The induced immunological responses then led to clinical responses such as solid tumor shrinkage, a decrease in leukemia cells, and reduction of M-protein (multiple myeloma). Long-term stabilization of disease with good quality of life, which might be characteristic of cancer vaccine therapy, was also reported. It is noteworthy that injection with a ""single"" kind of WT1 peptide elicited an immunological response strong enough to induce a clinical response, indicating that the WT1 peptide vaccine has therapeutic potential. The number of reports of the successful treatment of cancer patients (not only adult but also childhood malignancies) with WT1 vaccination is increasing. Strategies for further improvement in the efficacy of therapy, including combined use of chemotherapy drugs, molecular-target-based drugs, or WT1 helper peptides, are being proposed. WT1 peptide vaccination in an ""adjuvant setting"" should be considered a promising treatment to protect against progression or relapse of malignancies in cases with minimal residual disease.","['Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Li, Zheyu', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Shirakata, Toshiaki', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Oka Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Fujiki F', 'Li Z', 'Nakajima H', 'Hosen N', 'Shirakata T', 'Nishida S', 'Oji Y', 'Kawase I', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita City, Osaka, Japan. yoshi@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090901,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Peptides/administration & dosage/chemistry/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*chemistry']",2009/06/23 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/23 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ACA-MC-02 [pii]', '10.2174/187152009789056958 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2009 Sep;9(7):787-97. doi: 10.2174/187152009789056958.

It works by targeting, and turning off, specific tyrosine kinase proteins that cause the uncontrolled cell growth and the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Imatinib was designed on the basis of the structure of the ATP binding site of the Abl protein kinase with the aim to stabilizes the inactive form of Bcr-Abl, an oncoprotein involved in malignant transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, imatinib can also target other tyrosine kinase proteins different from Bcr-Abl such as Kit, that is the suspected cause of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Despite successful clinical results observed in the last years, the long-term effects of imatinib and its ability to completely eradicate CML are still unknown. Moreover, similar to many other anti-cancer drugs, clinical resistance to imatinib has emerged. In this review we will discuss the in vitro and in vivo results obtained with the novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors developed to overcome imatinib resistance in Bcr-Abl expressing hematologiocal disorders.","['Tolomeo, Manlio', 'Dieli, Francesco', 'Gebbia, Nicola', 'Simoni, Daniele']","['Tolomeo M', 'Dieli F', 'Gebbia N', 'Simoni D']","['Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerca in Oncologia Clinica, Policlinico P.

Mutations of the globin transcription factor 1 gene, GATA1, are associated with both TMD and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Transient myeloproliferative disorder typically presents with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and immature circulating white blood cells, and affects approximately 10% of neonates with Down syndrome. These abnormalities rapidly regress within the first few months of life. However, 20% to 30% of neonates with Down syndrome and TMD later develop leukemia. The tumor antigen PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) may serve as a marker for leukemic transformation.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine playing divergent roles in different cell types: induces differentiation in preadipocytes and, however, inhibits differentiation in pluripotent murine embryonic stem (mES) cells. However, roles of C/EBPbeta in mES cells are obscure. Here, we show for the first time that C/EBPbeta in the presence of LIF plays a role of sustaining undifferentiated state in this cell line, i.e. C/EBPbeta is a target of regulation of LIF, as described as follows. The expression of endogenous C/EBPbeta proteins in mES cells is positively correlated with the LIF added into medium. Even the exogenous C/EBPbeta proteins and their truncated form, LIP, artificially overexpressed in undifferentiated mES cells, do not enhance but inhibit ES cells' differentiation in the presence of LIF, and the long isoforms of C/EBPbeta proteins strongly enhance cell propagation. This enhancement lasts for a certain short time even after LIF removal. In the absence of LIF, C/EBPbeta and LIP induce expression of differentiation-related genes and promote mES cells' differentiation, as anticipated. With LIF, the expression levels of some differentiation-related genes regulated by C/EBPbeta and LIP were significantly lower than that without LIF. Therefore, in pluripotent mES cells C/EBPbeta is regulated by LIF and sustains undifferentiated state of those cells as a mediator of LIF.","['Sun, Li', 'Wang, Hai Zhen', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Liu, Ding Gan']","['Sun L', 'Wang HZ', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu DG']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Fen Zi Xi Bao Sheng Wu Xue Bao,Fen zi xi bao sheng wu xue bao = Journal of molecular cell biology,101249591,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Interactions', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology']",2009/06/20 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/06/20 09:00'],"['2009/06/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Fen Zi Xi Bao Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 2009 Apr;42(2):127-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib dose escalation was the main treatment option before dasatinib, which has 325-fold more potent inhibition than imatinib against unmutated Bcr-Abl in vitro. Data with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were available for the current study of dasatinib and high-dose imatinib in CP-CML resistant to imatinib at daily doses from 400 mg to 600 mg. METHODS: A phase 2, open-label study was initiated of 150 patients with imatinib-resistant CP-CML who were randomized (2:1) to receive either dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (n=101) or high-dose imatinib 800 mg (400 mg twice daily; n=49). RESULTS: At a minimum follow-up of 2 years, dasatinib demonstrated higher rates of complete hematologic response (93% vs 82%; P=.034), major cytogenetic response (MCyR) (53% vs 33%; P=.017), and complete cytogenetic response (44% vs 18%; P=.0025). At 18 months, the MCyR was maintained in 90% of patients on the dasatinib arm and in 74% of patients on the high-dose imatinib arm. Major molecular response rates also were more frequent with dasatinib than with high-dose imatinib (29% vs 12%; P=.028).

METHODS: One hundred three long-term survivors (ie, >or=5 years from diagnosis; 51% boys, mean age at diagnosis of 3.9 years, and mean time since diagnosis 7.5 years) completed standardized measures of basic and complex attention skills related to anterior (ie, inhibition, shifting attention, working memory), posterior (ie, focusing), and subcortical brain systems (ie, sustaining). RESULTS: Treatment intensity was related to sustained attention, with those patients treated on high-risk protocols displaying significantly lower performance. Girls performed worse than boys on measures related to the anterior attention system (ie, shifting attention, P<.042) and the subcortical attention system (ie, sustained attention, P<.001), whereas boys performed worse than girls on different measures of anterior control (ie, inhibition, P<.039; working memory, P<.003). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that children diagnosed with and treated for pediatric ALL perform poorly on select measures of attention and executive control, and that this performance is influenced by sex and treatment intensity.","['Jain, Neelam', 'Brouwers, Pim', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Cirino, Paul T', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Jain N', 'Brouwers P', 'Okcu MF', 'Cirino PT', 'Krull KR']","[""Department of Psychology, University of Houston, and Child Psychology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA. neelam.jain@stjude.org""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Age of Onset', '*Attention', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*psychology', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24464 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Sep 15;115(18):4238-45. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24464.,10.1002/cncr.24464 [doi],,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2009 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the majority of patients, imatinib induces a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR); however, complete molecular responses are infrequent. The Bcr-Abl fusion creates a unique sequence of amino acids that could constitute a target for immunomodulation. METHODS: A mixture of heteroclitic and native peptides derived from both b3a2 and b2a2 sequences was used to vaccinate patients with CML in CCyR who were receiving imatinib therapy and who had stable Bcr-Abl transcript levels. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled, all with b2a2 transcripts (including 2 patients who had coexpression of b2a2 and b3a2). Patients had received imatinib for a median of 62 months. Three of 10 patients achieved 1-log reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels, including the 2 patients who had received previous interferon therapy, and 3 other patients achieved a major molecular response. The vaccine was tolerated well, and there were no grade > or =3 adverse events. Vaccination did not affect the leukocyte profiles in peripheral blood except for regulatory T cells, which were down-regulated briefly during the late stage of vaccination in patients who achieved approximately 1-log reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels. CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggested that vaccination-related transient disruption of immune tolerance may contribute to the reduction in Bcr-Abl transcripts. Clinically, this Bcr-Abl peptide vaccine may transiently improve the molecular response in a subset of patients with CML.","['Jain, Nitin', 'Reuben, James M', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Li, Changping', 'Gao, Hui', 'Lee, Bang-Ning', 'Cohen, Evan N', 'Ebarb, Theresa', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Jain N', 'Reuben JM', 'Kantarjian H', 'Li C', 'Gao H', 'Lee BN', 'Cohen EN', 'Ebarb T', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Recently, 2 groups reported that WT1 mutations occur in approximately 10% of normal karyotype AMLs and are an independent predictor of poor outcome in this subgroup of patients with AML. METHODS: The authors studied a cohort of 268 young adults (ages 15-50 years) with AML who were treated on the Acute Leukemia French Association 9802 trial. WT1 exon 7 and 9 mutations were screened retrospectively by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The patients also were assessed for the presence of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), FLT3-D835/I836, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) mutations. RESULTS: WT1 mutations were identified in 14 patients (5%) and were associated with a younger age (P = .02) and an FLT3-ITD (P = .03). No mutation was detected in patients who had favorable cytogenetics. Patients who had WT1 mutations had a shorter overall survival at 4 years (22% vs 56%; P = .01) and a higher risk of recurrence at 4 years (82% vs 46%; P = .0008) compared with patients who had wild-type WT1. Within the subgroup of patients who had normal karyotype AML (n = 106), WT1 mutation was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for the risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicted that WT1 mutations represent an adverse prognostic factor in young adults with AML. Prospective trials should confirm the clinical relevance of WT1 mutations in relation to other prognostic factors in patients with AML.","['Renneville, Aline', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Zurawski, Virginie', 'Llopis, Laura', 'Biggio, Valeria', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Philippe, Nathalie', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Renneville A', 'Boissel N', 'Zurawski V', 'Llopis L', 'Biggio V', 'Nibourel O', 'Philippe N', 'Thomas X', 'Dombret H', 'Preudhomme C']","['Department of Hematology, University of Lille Medical School, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24442 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Aug 15;115(16):3719-27. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24442.,10.1002/cncr.24442 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant antitumor activity of delimotecan against human metastatic melanoma xenograft model Me15392 is reported. Dacarbazine, the drug approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, was ineffective in this melanoma model. Pharmacokinetic studies, together with the expression analysis of mRNA for enzymes involved in delimotecan metabolism, showed that T-2513 and other cytotoxic metabolites of delimotecan (SN 38 and T-0055) are generated in greater quantities in the tumor tissue than in toxicity target tissues, such as liver, thus accounting for the antitumoral activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that human metastatic melanoma cells are able to phagocytose delimotecan and cleave it to release the cytotoxic moieties T-2513 in the tumoral environment. Further flow cytometric analysis showed a higher recruitment of macrophages in xenografted human metastatic melanoma, when compared with other human tumors. Thus, the antitumoral activity of delimotecan exerted on metastatic melanoma is due to several factors: (i) the ability of melanoma cells to phagocytose and metabolise delimotecan; (ii) the accumulation of delimotecan in tumoral mass; (iii) the recruitment of macrophage cells to the melanoma nodule and (iv) the expression in melanoma cells of a pattern of enzymes that converts delimotecan into cytotoxic metabolites. Based on these results, delimotecan might be exploited as a new anticancer agent for the therapy of metastatic melanoma because of its high efficacy and good selectivity, and therefore clinical trials for this indication are warranted.","['Bigioni, Mario', 'Parlani, Massimo', 'Bressan, Alessandro', 'Bellarosa, Daniela', 'Rivoltini, Licia', 'Animati, Fabio', 'Crea, Attilio', 'Bugianesi, Rossana', 'Maggi, Carlo Alberto', 'Manzini, Stefano', 'Binaschi, Monica']","['Bigioni M', 'Parlani M', 'Bressan A', 'Bellarosa D', 'Rivoltini L', 'Animati F', 'Crea A', 'Bugianesi R', 'Maggi CA', 'Manzini S', 'Binaschi M']","['Pharmacology Department of Menarini Ricerche SpA, Pomezia, Rome, Italy. mbigioni@menarini-ricerche.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dextrans)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'B2K8L0IE7T (T 0128)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Dextrans/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Topotecan/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24661 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Nov 15;125(10):2456-64. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24661.,10.1002/ijc.24661 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrating viral vector systems based on the genera of the retroviridae and on adeno-associated virus are suitable tools, as the integration of viral vector genomes into the cellular chromosomal DNA allows for a more stable and long-lasting transgene expression than episomal gene-delivery models. Two nonviral gene-delivery systems with integrating properties have also been developed. These are based on the Sleeping Beauty DNA transposon system and on the Streptomyces bacteriophage integrase phiC31. However, the integration of recombinant vector systems may damage the natural genetic arrangement of the target cell. Such genetic alterations are termed insertional mutagenesis, which might result in malignant cell transformation. Insertional mutagenesis caused leukemia in five patients who participated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-X1; sadly, one of the patients died. Gene therapists had to assess the real risk-versus-benefit ratio for the use of retroviral vectors in patients and devise novel strategies to minimize the occurrence of insertional mutagenesis-related malignancies.

Imatinib mesylate, a BCR-ABL TK inhibitor, is the frontline therapy for CML. Despite the stunning efficacy of this agent, a small number of patients develop a suboptimal response or resistance to imatinib. In newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML, the rate of resistance to imatinib at 4 years was up to 20%, increasing to 70% to 90% for patients in the accelerated/blastic phase. Resistance to imatinib led to the development of novel TK inhibitors such as dasatinib. Several clinical trials have reported more durable complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses with this agent in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib is well tolerated and has broad efficacy, resulting in durable responses in patients with any BCR-ABL mutation except for T3151 and mutations in codon 317 - most commonly F317L - including mutations that were highly resistant to imatinib, such as L248, Y253, E255, F359, and H396. Dasatinib is recommended for CML in chronic, blastic or accelerated phase that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib was approved by the FDA at 100 mg once daily as the starting dose in patients with chronic phase CML and at 70 mg twice daily in patients with accelerated or blastic phase CML. Various clinical trial results provided evidence that resistance to one TK inhibitor can be reversed with the use of a different TK inhibitor (TKI). Other second-generation TKIs with activity in CML include nilotinib, bosutinib and INNO 406. New molecules, such as the inhibitor of Aurora family serine-threonine kinases, MK0457, which has antileukemic activity in CML associated with a T315I mutation, are being investigated.

T-ALL patients present at diagnosis with increased white cell counts and hepatosplenomegaly, and are at an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse. For that reason, T-ALL patients usually receive cranial irradiation in addition to intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The marked increase in survival is thought to be worth the considerable side-effects associated with this therapy. Such complications include secondary tumours, neurocognitive deficits, endocrine disorders and growth impairment. Little is known about the mechanism of leukaemic cell infiltration of the CNS, despite its clinical importance. Here we show, using T-ALL animal modelling and gene-expression profiling, that the chemokine receptor CCR7 (ref. 5) is the essential adhesion signal required for the targeting of leukaemic T-cells into the CNS. Ccr7 gene expression is controlled by the activity of the T-ALL oncogene Notch1 and is expressed in human tumours carrying Notch1-activating mutations. Silencing of either CCR7 or its chemokine ligand CCL19 (ref. 6) in an animal model of T-ALL specifically inhibits CNS infiltration. Furthermore, murine CNS-targeting by human T-ALL cells depends on their ability to express CCR7. These studies identify a single chemokine-receptor interaction as a CNS 'entry' signal, and open the way for future pharmacological targeting. Targeted inhibition of CNS involvement in T-ALL could potentially decrease the intensity of CNS-targeted therapy, thus reducing its associated short- and long-term complications.","['Buonamici, Silvia', 'Trimarchi, Thomas', 'Ruocco, Maria Grazia', 'Reavie, Linsey', 'Cathelin, Severine', 'Mar, Brenton G', 'Klinakis, Apostolos', 'Lukyanov, Yevgeniy', 'Tseng, Jen-Chieh', 'Sen, Filiz', 'Gehrie, Eric', 'Li, Mengling', 'Newcomb, Elizabeth', 'Zavadil, Jiri', 'Meruelo, Daniel', 'Lipp, Martin', 'Ibrahim, Sherif', 'Efstratiadis, Argiris', 'Zagzag, David', 'Bromberg, Jonathan S', 'Dustin, Michael L', 'Aifantis, Iannis']","['Buonamici S', 'Trimarchi T', 'Ruocco MG', 'Reavie L', 'Cathelin S', 'Mar BG', 'Klinakis A', 'Lukyanov Y', 'Tseng JC', 'Sen F', 'Gehrie E', 'Li M', 'Newcomb E', 'Zavadil J', 'Meruelo D', 'Lipp M', 'Ibrahim S', 'Efstratiadis A', 'Zagzag D', 'Bromberg JS', 'Dustin ML', 'Aifantis I']","['Department of Pathology and New York University Cancer Institute, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56AI070310/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI072039/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI062765/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072039/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041428/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI41428/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 P01 CA97403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA097403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI070310/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Ccl19 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccr7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Chemokine CCL19/deficiency/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL21/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR7/deficiency/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/08/13 09:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [medline]']","['nature08020 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08020 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Jun 18;459(7249):1000-4. doi: 10.1038/nature08020.,10.1038/nature08020 [doi],PMC3750496,['NIHMS488881'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested whether cotransplantation of embryonic neurons with 1 or more neurotrophic factors into peripheral nerve improved axon regeneration, muscle fiber area, reinnervation, and function to a greater degree than cell transplantation alone. Sciatic nerves of adult Fischer rats were cut to denervate muscles; 1 week later, embryonic ventral spinal cord cells (days 14-15) were transplanted into the tibial nerve stump as the only source of neurons for muscle reinnervation. Factors that promote motoneuron survival (cardiotrophin 1; fibroblast growth factor 2; glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; insulin-like growth factor 1; leukemia inhibitory factor; and hepatocyte growth factor) were added to the transplant individually or in combinations. Inclusion of a single factor with the cells resulted in comparable myelinated axon counts, muscle fiber areas, and evoked electromyographic activity to cells alone 10 weeks after transplantation. Only cell transplantation with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 significantly increased motoneuron survival, myelinated axon counts, muscle reinnervation, and evoked electromyographic activity compared with cells alone. Thus, immediate application of a specific combination of factors to dissociated embryonic neurons improves survival of motoneurons and the long-term function of reinnervated muscle.","['Grumbles, Robert M', 'Sesodia, Sanjay', 'Wood, Patrick M', 'Thomas, Christine K']","['Grumbles RM', 'Sesodia S', 'Wood PM', 'Thomas CK']","['Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida 33136-2104, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS039098/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS039098-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 NS039098/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-39098/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,['0 (Nerve Growth Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Electromyography', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Female', 'Motor Neurons/*physiology', 'Muscle Denervation', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/innervation/*physiopathology', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Regeneration/physiology', 'Neuromuscular Junction/physiopathology', 'Neurons/physiology/*transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sciatic Nerve/injuries/physiology', 'Sciatic Neuropathy/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Spinal Cord/embryology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181a9360f [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2009 Jul;68(7):736-46. doi: 10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181a9360f.,10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181a9360f [doi],PMC2727878,['NIHMS131620'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Analysis of cancer risk evaluation was done using the retrospective cohort method, an indirect standardization. The observed numbers of cancer cases were obtained from the National Cancer Registry. The expected numbers were based on the age- and gender-specific incidence rates for the general Lithuanian population in 5-year periods. The standardized incidence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (assuming that the incidence of cancer follows the Poisson distribution) were calculated. RESULTS: During the follow-up of 1978-2004, 159 cases of cancer were observed. There was no increased overall cancer risk in men (SIR=0.92, 95% CI=0.62-1.33, based on 29 cases) and women (SIR=0.97, 95% CI=0.81-1.15, based on 130 cases). The risk of leukemia among men and women was insignificantly increased.

TPMT activity is significantly altered by genetics, and heterozygous and even more homozygous variant people reveal substiantially decreased TPMT activity. Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regularly includes the use of thiopurine drugs. Importantly, childhood ALL patients with low TPMT activity have been considered to be at increased risk of developing therapy-associated acute myeloid leukemia and brain tumors. In the present study, we genotyped 105 of 129 patients who developed a secondary malignant neoplasm after ALL treatment on 7 consecutive German Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster trials for all functionally relevant TPMT variants. Frequencies of TPMT variants were similarly distributed in secondary malignant neoplasm patients and the overall ALL patient population of 814 patients. Thus, TPMT does not play a major role in the etiology of secondary malignant neoplasm after treatment for childhood ALL, according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster strategies.","['Stanulla, Martin', 'Schaeffeler, Elke', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Coulthard, Sally A', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Dordelmann, Michael', 'Welte, Karl', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Eichelbaum, Michel', 'Riehm, Hansjorg', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Schwab, Matthias']","['Stanulla M', 'Schaeffeler E', 'Moricke A', 'Coulthard SA', 'Cario G', 'Schrauder A', 'Kaatsch P', 'Dordelmann M', 'Welte K', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reiter A', 'Eichelbaum M', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M', 'Schwab M']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Kiel, Germany. martin.stanulla@uk-sh.de""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/enzymology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37422-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-12-193250 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 13;114(7):1314-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-12-193250.

CP activation is initiated by C1q binding to cell-bound IgG. Therefore, we examined the role of C1q in the dynamics of complement activation and CDC of B cell lines and primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, reacted with OFA or RTX. C1q binding, complement activation, and colocalization of C1q with cell-bound mAbs were determined by flow cytometry and high-resolution digital imaging. C1q binds avidly to OFA-opsonized Raji and Daudi cells (K(D) = 12-16 nM) and colocalizes substantially with cell-bound OFA. Cells opsonized with OFA undergo high levels of complement activation and CDC in C1q-depleted serum supplemented with low concentrations of C1q. Under comparable conditions, RTX-opsonized cells bind less C1q; in addition, even when higher concentrations of C1q are used to achieve comparable C1q binding to RTX-opsonized cells, less complement activation and CDC are observed. Greater CDC induced by OFA may occur because C1q is bound in close proximity and with high avidity to OFA, resulting in effective CP activation. Moreover, OFA binds to the small, extracellular CD20 loop, placing the mAb considerably closer to the cell membrane than does RTX. This may facilitate effective capture and concentration of activated complement components closer to the cell membrane, potentially shielding them from inactivation by fluid phase agents and promoting efficient generation of the membrane attack complex.","['Pawluczkowycz, Andrew W', 'Beurskens, Frank J', 'Beum, Paul V', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Pawluczkowycz AW', 'Beurskens FJ', 'Beum PV', 'Lindorfer MA', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Parren PW', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, 22908, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090617,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement C1q/*metabolism/physiology', 'Complement C3b/metabolism', 'Complement Pathway, Classical/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Opsonin Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Rituximab']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0900632 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0900632 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Jul 1;183(1):749-58. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0900632.

In contrast to other types of childhood acute leukemias, mixed lineage leukemia presents with a dismal prognosis and despite the availability of advanced treatment methods cure rates have stagnated over the last years. Mixed lineage leukemia is characterized by the presence of MLL fusion proteins that are the result of chromosomal translocations affecting the MLL gene at 11q23. These events juxtapose the amino-terminus of the histone methyltransferase MLL with a variety of different fusion partners that destroy normal histone methyltransferase function of MLL and replace it by heterologous functions contributed by the fusion partner. The resulting chimeras are transcriptional regulators that take control of targets normally controlled by MLL with the clustered HOX homeobox genes as prominent examples. Recent studies suggested that MLL fusion partners activate transcription by two different mechanisms. Some of these proteins are themselves chromatin modifiers that introduce histone acetylation whereas other fusion partners can recruit histone methyltransferases. In particular, histone H3 specific methylation at lysine 79 catalyzed by DOT1L has been recognized as a hallmark of chromatin activated by MLL fusion proteins. Interestingly, several frequent MLL fusion partners seem to coordinate DOT1L activity with a protein complex that stimulates the elongation phase of transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II. The discovery of these novel enzymatic activities that are essentially involved in MLL fusion protein function presents potential new targets for a rational drug development.","['Slany, Robert K']",['Slany RK'],"['Department of Genetics, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany. rslany@biologie.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090616,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dimerization', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.002436 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.002436 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Jul;94(7):984-93. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.002436.

DESIGN AND METHODS: To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of this malignancy, we analyzed 27 cases of cytogenetically proven dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia. RESULTS: Dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia was diagnosed at presentation in 22 cases and at relapse or disease progression in 5 cases. At the time of diagnosis of dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia, extranodal involvement was found in 25 cases (93%) and central nervous system involvement occurred in 15 cases (56%). The median survival and 1-year survival rate of the 27 cases were only 6 months and 22%, respectively, after diagnosis of the dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia. Seven cases of triple-hit lymphoma/leukemia (dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia with 3q27/BCL6 translocation) were included; the median survival of these patients was only 4 months from the diagnosis of the dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia. The duration of survival of the patients with a triple-hit malignancy was shorter than that of the other 20 cases of dual-hit lymphoma/leukemia (p=0.02). The translocation partner of MYC subdivided the dual-hit cases into two groups; 14 cases of IGH and 13 cases of IGK/L. The MIB-1 index was investigated in 14 cases with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and was higher in the group with MYC-IGH translocation (n=7) than in the MYC-IGK/L group (n=7) (p=0.02). Overall survival was not different between the MYC-IGH translocation group (n=14) and the MYC-IGK or MYC-IGL translocation group (n=13).

DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the effects of phenoxodiol on plasma membrane electron transport, MTT responses and viability of activated and resting human T cells. In addition, we evaluated the effect of phenoxodiol on the viability of leukemic cell lines and primary myeloid and lymphoid leukemic blasts. RESULTS: We demonstrated that phenoxodiol inhibited plasma membrane electron transport and cell proliferation (IC(50) 46 microM and 5.4 microM, respectively) and promoted apoptosis of rapidly proliferating human T cells but did not affect resting T cells. Phenoxodiol also induced apoptosis in T cells stimulated in HLA-mismatched allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. Conversely, non-proliferating T cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction remained viable and could be restimulated in a third party mixed lymphocyte reaction, in the absence of phenoxodiol. In addition, we demonstrated that leukemic blasts from patients with primary acute myeloid leukemia (n=22) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=8) were sensitive to phenoxodiol. The lymphocytic leukemic blasts were more sensitive than the myeloid leukemic blasts to 10 muM phenoxodiol exposure for 24h (viability of 23+/-4% and 64+/-5%, respectively, p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: The ability of phenoxodiol to kill rapidly proliferating lymphocytes makes this drug a promising candidate for the treatment of pathologically-activated lymphocytes such as those in acute lymphoid leukemia, or diseases driven by T-cell proliferation such as auto-immune diseases and graft-versus-host disease.","['Herst, Patries M', 'Davis, Joanne E', 'Neeson, Paul', 'Berridge, Michael V', 'Ritchie, David S']","['Herst PM', 'Davis JE', 'Neeson P', 'Berridge MV', 'Ritchie DS']","['Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, Wellington 6005, New Zealand. pherst@malaghan.org.nz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090616,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '995FT1W541 (phenoxodiol)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins/pathology']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.003996 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.003996 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Jul;94(7):928-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.003996.

METHODS: Microsoft SQL 2005 databases was used to make a mathematical analysis of 3708 patients with leukemia in Chinese Marrow Donor Program (CMDP) from 2000 to 2006. The distributive characteristics were calculated by sex, age and area of patients with leukemia and then compared by constituent ratio and relative ratio statistics method. RESULTS: A total of 3708 cases of leukemia were registered for waiting donor during the period 2000-2006 in CMDP, the age of patients were from 7 months to 69 years, the median age of diagnosis was 24.5 years, standard deviation was 6.7-years-old; males suffered more than females, and the ratio was 1.95: 1 (2451/1257). There were 1202 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 1066 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1435 with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 5 with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), CML was the most common patients. The distributive of 3708 patients with leukemia peak was from 15 to 30 years age group, 542 patients were at the age of 15 years, 559 patients were at the age group above 20 years, 514 patients were at the age above 25, 522 patients were at the age over 30-years-old. ALL patients were accounted for 49.36% (613/1242), AML patients accounted for 27.78% (245/1242), CML patients accounted for 22.78% (283/1242), CLL patients accounted for 0.08% (1/1242) in the age group of under 20 years (childhood group). All subjects were mainly in childhood patients with leukemia; The distributive of patients with leukemia in 30 areas were different, leukemia patients were not registered in one area, 494 patients were at the highest peak, 101 patients were in the median. CONCLUSION: The majority of leukemia patients for waiting stem cell transplantation were registered among children and the adolescents groups, males were suffered more than the females. For children, the major type of leukemia was ALL, being necessary to pay more attention to the education of health, and the precaution of leukemia. The distributive of patients with leukemia for waiting stem cell transplantation was different in 30 areas, and the peak region of leukemia should be in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shangdong, and Zhejiang provinces.","['Gao, Su-qing', 'Cheng, Liang-hong', 'Lu, Liang', 'Jin, Shi-zheng', 'Cheng, Xi', 'Zou, Hong-yan', 'Deng, Zhi-hui', 'Zhu, Wei-gang']","['Gao SQ', 'Cheng LH', 'Lu L', 'Jin SZ', 'Cheng X', 'Zou HY', 'Deng ZH', 'Zhu WG']","['Shenzhen Blood Center Institute, Shenzhen Human Leucocyte Antigen Laboratory of Chinese Marrow Donor Program, Shenzhen 518035, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', '*Biological Specimen Banks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/classification/*epidemiology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Distribution', '*Tissue Donors', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jan;43(1):19-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene Therapy (GT) was envisioned as an alternative treatment for PID by inserting the correct gene into the patient's haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Up to date, GT for PID has succeeded in 40 of 44 patients treated in four clinical trials. However, five children enrolled in the SCID-X1 clinical trial developed leukaemia-like disease produced by aberrant expression of oncogenes.

It is known for its variable course--from benign to prospectless forms. Reliable prognostic markers are needed to precify the diagnosis and the correct therapy. The ZAP-70 protein, as a prospective marker, can be highly expressed in leukemic cells of B-CLL patients. It is related to a worse prognosis requiring intense therapy from the beginning. The present study includes 20 cases of bone marrow trephine biopsy from patients with diagnosed B-CLL and 20 control cases without neoplastic infiltration. The specimens were investigated with standard immunohistochemical technique and with the use of the amplification system (DakoCytomation). The results were evaluated semiquantitatively as negative (less than 5%), positive (above 30%), and irregularly positive (5-30% of positive leukemic cells) and consecutively correlated with clinical evaluation of prognosis of the patient. The evaluation of the positivity was controlled also by morphometric analysis by determination of the area of ZAP-70 positivity related to the whole area of nuclei in the section. In the control specimens the ZAP-70 positivity was restricted to T-lymphocytes only. The level of the nuclear positivity of ZAP-70 protein detected in transformed B-lymphocytes showed significant correlation with the worse or the better clinical prognosis, respectively. Cases with irregular positivity did not show unambiguous clinical correlation. The use of the amplification system allowed to apply lower concentration of the primary antibody, reduction of background staining and increased the contrast of the findings leading to reduction of irregularly positive cases from 30% (with routine histochemistry) to 10%. It can be concluded that ZAP-70 represents a valuable prognostic marker for the chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia. Its evaluation by histochemistry is a suitable method for clinical praxis. Problematic may be the evaluation of borderline irregularly positive cases, in which the use of the histochemical amplification system is helpful. Strictly determined criteria are needed for limitation of inaccurate interpretation of the results.","['Urbanova, A', 'Janega, P', 'Masarova, K', 'Stefanikova, Z', 'Babal, P']","['Urbanova A', 'Janega P', 'Masarova K', 'Stefanikova Z', 'Babal P']","['Ustav patologickej anatomie, Lekarska fakulta, Univerzita Komenskeho v Bratislave, Slovenska republika. andrea.urbanova@fmed.uniba.sk']",['slo'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Cesk Patol,Ceskoslovenska patologie,0050734,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*analysis']",2009/06/19 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/06/19 09:00'],"['2009/06/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cesk Patol. 2009 Apr;45(2):40-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,Imunohistochemicka detekcia proteinu ZAP-70 a jej vyznam v diagnostike B-CLL.,,,,,,,,,

A cytopathologist needs to adopt a cautious interpretive approach while dealing with a lymphoid-rich pericardial effusion in order to prevent a false negative diagnosis. CASE: A 27-year-old male presented with breathlessness, ascites, bilateral pedal edema and fever. He had mild hepatomegaly. On detailed clinical examination, a diagnosis of anemia with cardiac tamponade was made. Cytology of pericardial fluid revealed a large number of lymphoid cells in a hemorrhagic background that, under low magnification, closely resembled mature lymphocytes. However, a careful examination of May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained cytologic smears, under an oil immersion objective (x 1,000), showed atypical lymphoid cells having blastoid morphology. Rare lymphoid cells displayed a ""hand mirror"" appearance. A hematologic workup was carried out to exclude leukemia/lymphoma. Complete blood count revealed pancytopenia with abnormal lymphoid cells. Bone marrow showed replacement by 90% lymphoblasts exhibiting periodic acid-Schiff stain, CD3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positivity. A diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (FAB L1) was offered, and the patient was started on a remission and induction regimen. However, he had a rapid downhill course and died of cardiorespiratory arrest.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, characteristics, and pattern of malignancies in patients with beta thalassemia major (BTM) and beta thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in Iran. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter study via a retrospective chart review of patients with BTM and BTI between 2002 and 2007 in four thalassemia centers in Iran. A total of 4,630 records of patients with thalassemia were evaluated. Statistical analyses were done with SPSS software v. 15. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: We detected 11 patients with beta thalassemia who also had malignant disease. Five patients (45.4%) were diagnosed with lymphoma and five with leukemia. The proportion of patients with cancer was higher in those with BTI. Cancer was diagnosed in patients with thalassemia aged 0-39 years, but not in any of the older patients. In patients with thalassemia overall and in patients with BTI, the highest age-specific rate of cancer incidence was seen in children <10 years old, whereas in the BTM group the highest incidence was observed in patients 20-29 years old. There were no statistically significant differences between patients with BTM and BTI and cancer regarding age, sex, splenectomy, hemoglobin, ferritin level, or malignancy type. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of malignancy and beta thalassemia is not rare. Any alarming signs and symptoms including worsening anemia, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy should be a motive for concern because these symptoms may signal malignant disease.","['Karimi, Mehran', 'Giti, Rahil', 'Haghpanah, Sezaneh', 'Azarkeivan, Azita', 'Hoofar, Hamid', 'Eslami, Masoomeh']","['Karimi M', 'Giti R', 'Haghpanah S', 'Azarkeivan A', 'Hoofar H', 'Eslami M']","['Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. karimim@sums.ac.ir']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'beta-Thalassemia/*complications/epidemiology']",2009/06/18 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22144 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Dec;53(6):1064-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22144.,10.1002/pbc.22144 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greater than expected fetal growth has been positively associated with the risk of the development of some cancers in childhood, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the biological mechanisms underlying such associations are thought to involve insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Circulating IGF levels are highly correlated with fetal growth, and IGFs are believed to play an important role in carcinogenesis; however, these two bodies of evidence have not been well integrated and, as a result, the potential underlying biological mechanisms linking the IGF system with the development of specific childhood cancers have not been elucidated. This review aims to draw together and summarize the literature linking the IGF system, rapidity of fetal growth, and risk of some specific childhood cancers; suggest explanations for some of the inconsistencies observed in previous studies of these associations; and propose an integrated framework for the putative involvement of the IGF system in the development of at least some childhood cancers. If the challenges involved in studying the complex IGF system can be overcome, this field presents an exciting opportunity to elucidate etiological pathways to childhood malignancies.","['Callan, Anna Carita', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Callan AC', 'Milne E']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, PO Box 855, West Perth, WA 6872, Australia. acallan@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Somatomedins)'],IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fetal Development/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/embryology/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Somatomedins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/06/18 09:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9378-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Dec;20(10):1783-98. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9378-z.,10.1007/s10552-009-9378-z [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of family history on survival in NHL has not been examined. METHODS: We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to estimate hazard ratios in NHL by histology and family history. RESULTS: Using diffuse centroblastic lymphoma as reference (HR 1.0), patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and hairy-cell leukemia had the best survival. Survival advantage was also noted among patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and different kinds of follicular lymphomas. For T-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides showed a favorable prognosis. As for survival by family history, a total of 98 familial cases were noted in our Database with a similar prognosis compared to sporadic cases in both parental and offspring generations. A non-significant familial concordance of either good or poor survival was noted among family members when probands' prognosis was stratified by survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide quantitative prognosis data for patients with NHL according to specific histologies. Patients with a familial NHL had a similar prognosis compared to patients with sporadic disease. The data suggest familial concordance in either good or poor survival among family members.","['Ji, Jianguang', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Lenner, Per', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Ji J', 'Forsti A', 'Sundquist J', 'Lenner P', 'Hemminki K']","['Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, CRC, Hus 28, Plan 11, Ing 72, UMAS, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.

Since Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhoea in non-haematologic patients, we were interested in its incidence in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In this retrospective study, we analysed 134 patients with AML receiving a total of 301 chemotherapy courses. Diarrhoea occurred during 33% of all courses in 58 patients. C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) occurred in 18% of all patients and 9% of all treatment courses. Almost one third of diarrhoea episodes were caused by C. difficile. CDAD was associated with older age (58 vs. 50 years), number of antibiotics administered (2 vs. 1), duration of antibiotic therapy (7 vs. 4 days), ceftazidime as the antibiotic of choice (75% vs. 54%) and duration of neutropenia (12 vs. 7 days) prior to onset of diarrhoea. An increased risk for CDAD was seen for prolonged neutropenia. CDAD responded well to oral metronidazole and/or vancomycin and no patient died of this complication. In conclusion, CDAD is common in patients with AML receiving chemotherapy.

These multipotent GS (mGS) cells have been known to differ from GS cells in their DNA methylation pattern. In this study, we examined the DNA methylation status of the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) in multipotent adult germline stem (maGS) cells to elucidate how epigenetic imprints are altered by culture conditions. DNA methylation was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing PCR of established maGS cells cultured in the presence of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) alone or both GDNF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The results showed that the H19 ICR in maGS cells of both groups was hypermethylated and had an androgenetic pattern similar to that of GS cells. In line with these data, the relative abundance of the Igf2 mRNA transcript was two-fold higher and that of H19 was three fold lower than in control embryonic stem cells. The androgenetic DNA methylation pattern of the H19 ICR was maintained even after 54 passages. Furthermore, differentiating maGS cells from retinoic acid-treated embryoid bodies maintained the androgenetic imprinting pattern of the H19 ICR. Taken together these data suggest that our maGS cells are epigenetically stable for the H19 gene during in vitro modifications. Further studies on the epigenetic regulation and chromatin structure of maGS cells are therefore necessary before their full potential can be utilized in regenerative medicine.","['Oh, Shin Hye', 'Jung, Yoon Hee', 'Gupta, Mukesh Kumar', 'Uhm, Sang Jun', 'Lee, Hoon Taek']","['Oh SH', 'Jung YH', 'Gupta MK', 'Uhm SJ', 'Lee HT']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio-Organ Research Center, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090612,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (H19 long non-coding RNA)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics']",2009/06/18 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10059-009-0084-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2009 Jun 30;27(6):635-40. doi: 10.1007/s10059-009-0084-1.

To investigate the contribution of cell-intrinsic features and determine the frequency of insertional proto-oncogene activation, we sorted hematopoietic subpopulations before transduction with replication-deficient gamma-retroviral vectors and studied the clonal repertoire in transplanted C57BL/6J mice. Progressive clonal dominance only developed in the progeny of populations with intrinsic stem cell potential, where expanding clones with insertional upregulation of proto-oncogenes such as Evi1 were retrieved with a frequency of approximately 10(-4). Longitudinal studies by high-throughput sequencing and locus-specific quantitative PCR showed clones with >50-fold expansion between weeks 5 and 31 after transplantation. In contrast, insertional events in proto-oncogenes did not endow the progeny of multipotent or myeloid-restricted progenitors with the potential for clonal dominance (risk <10(-6)). Transducing sorted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors in short-term cultures improved chimerism, and although clonal dominance developed, there was no evidence for insertional events in the vicinity of proto-oncogenes as the underlying cause. We conclude that cell-intrinsic properties cooperate with vector-related features to determine the incidence and consequences of insertional mutagenesis.

The personal exposure of workers to solvents used in the factory was evaluated to examine the role of implemented standard ventilation system. For this purpose, Toluene and Xylene concentration were monitored before and after the application of ventilation systems. Personal samples and subsequent analysis were conducted according to OSHA's method No: 12. Samples were analyzed, using Gas Chromatography. The results showed that the ventilation standards recommended by ACGIH were able to control Toluene and Xylene vapors successfully below the recommended TLVs (e.g. 44.49 ppm and 97.73 ppm respectively). It was also discovered that although Benzene was not reported as a component of the paint, its concentration in breathing zone of workers were much higher than the respective TLV (e.g. 4.5 ppm). This could be from the impurity of solvents used in paint factories which raises new questions. According to IRIS epidemiologic information, it was found that implementation of industrial ventilation systems decrease the relative risk (RR) of leukemia due to exposure to benzene, from 66.4 to 3.2 cases per work life, in this factory.

The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of a second neoplasm and its clinical course in children treated in Gdansk in the years 1992-2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 420 children and young adults included in the study. They were treated for malignant tumours in this period in the Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, Oncology and Endocrinology Medical Academy of Gdansk. The medical records of these patients were analysed. RESULTS: The second neoplasm was diagnosed in 9 patients, aged 9 to 23 years. They were treated for nephroblastoma - 3 cases, soft tissue sarcoma - 2, Ewing's sarcoma - 1, medulloblastoma - 1, retinoblastoma - 1 and neuroblastoma - 1 case. The second neoplasms were: acute non lymphoblastic leukaemia - 2, soft tissue sarcoma - 2, osteosarcoma - 2, chondrosarcoma - 1, renal cell carcinoma - 1 and glioblastoma multiforme - 1 case. Time between the first and second diagnosis was from 3 and 11/12 to 19 years. Treatment failed in 5 out of 9 children treated for osteosarcoma (2/2), chondrosarcoma (1/1), soft tissue sarcoma (1/2) and acute non lymphoblastic leukaemia (1/2). These patients died of progression of neoplastic disease during 2 to 20 months after the diagnosis of the second tumour. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the second tumour worsens the prognosis. It is difficult to define the factors that predispose to the second neoplasm.

When there is no donor available, combined immunosuppressive therapy is given. AIM: evaluation of results of immunosupressive therapy in children with severe aplastic anaemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: SAA was diagnosed in 105 children (42 girls, 73 boys), aged 2-18 years, in the eleven haematological centres in Poland, between 1993-2007. All patients received the Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party of the EBMT protocol which included: antilymphocyte globulin or antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporin A, prednisolone. Granulocyto- or granulocytomacrophagic-cell stimulation factor was additionally administered during deep neutropenia. Haematological response was evaluated on day 84 or 112 and 180 of the therapy. RESULTS: complete remission occurred in 53 patients (51.5%), partial remission in 27 (24.7%), no response was obtained in 25 children (23.8%) on day 180, of the therapy. Period of observation was from 12 months to 12.5 years. During this time relapse occurred in 10 patients (9.5%). We observed 22 deaths: 8 early, during the first 3 months of IS and 14 after the first 3 months of immunosuppresive therapy (IS). At present 70 children (66.6%) are in first remission with lasts from 12 months to 12.5 years. The survival at 12.5-years is 78.6%. During the 12.5 years of follow-up we had two cases with a late clonal complication (PNH and MDS). Transformation to acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia was observed in two of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Immunosuppresive therapy (IS) in children with SAA, without bone marrow family donors, is more effective after introduction of combined IS (12.5 years survival in this study was 80% for children with very severe aplastic anaemia (v SAA). 2.

Nine patients were seronegative for CMV. One fatal outcome was caused by CMV pneumonitis, confirmed by ELISA test (IgM+; IgG+). Increased total bilirubin, aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase levels correlated with CMV DNA level in one blood sample. During the chemotherapy no EBV antibodies were detected in 6 patients despite positive results in earlier tests. Viral DNA was detected in one blood sample and in 2 patients it was detected in bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: In children with leukaemia during chemotherapy primary and reactivation EBV infection occurred more often than CMV infection. Part of patients with EBV or CMV infections were seronegative during chemotherapy. Molecular biology should be the method of choice for confirmation and monitoring viral infection during intensive chemotherapy for these patients.","['Mucha, Maja', 'Pawelec, Katarzyna', 'Matysiak, Michal']","['Mucha M', 'Pawelec K', 'Matysiak M']","['Katedra i Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii AM w Warszawie, ul.

In majority of cases the pancreatitis is oedematous and self-limiting. Acute haemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis caused by L-asparaginase is rare but potentially life-threatening complication. We present 2 cases of acute pancreatitis in children aged 2 and 4 years. They were diagnosed to have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and were treated according to the ALLLIC BFM 2002 protocol. Acute pancreatitis developed in these children after induction therapy and was followed by formation of a pseudocyst. In both cases the diagnosis of this complication was made directly after phase I of the protocol I (after eighth dose of L-Asparaginase). In the first case the course of acute pancreatitis was mild. Normalization of the amylase levels occurred after 7 days and the diagnosis of post inflammatory cyst was made 15 days after the first signs of the disease. But thereafter, during the additional complication (pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriemia) the pancreatic cyst became infected. In the second case acute pancreatitis had a severe course and the child required treatment in the Intensive Care Unit for 21 days. The cyst was diagnosed after 20 days from the beginning of symptoms. The surgical procedure, applied in both cases was internal drainage by anastomosis of the cyst with the back wall of the stomach. Antileukaemic treatment was recommenced after 6-8 weeks when complications resolved. Currently both children are well and remain in haematological remission and continue maintenance chemotherapy.","['Sikorska-Fic, Barbara', 'Stanczak, Elzbieta', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Kaminski, Andrzej']","['Sikorska-Fic B', 'Stanczak E', 'Matysiak M', 'Kaminski A']","['Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii WUM, ul.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 14 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry both at diagnosis and at relapse - in 12 patients with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and in 2 patients with T-ALL. RESULTS: The conversion in blast immunophenotype was observed in 12 out of 14 patients (86%). Antigen CD34 turned out to be the most unstable antigen - the shift in the signal expression was present in 57% of BCP-ALL and in both T-ALL cases. Regarding B-lineage markers, the shifts most frequently concerned CD20 (shifts present in 41.5% of cases) and CD22 (27%). Among the T-lineage markers: CD3, CD4 and CD8 demonstrated the highest incidence of altered signal expression. On the other hand, the most stable antigen included CD19 and CD10 for the BCP-ALL group and CD1a, CD2, CD5, CD7 for T-ALL patients. Expression of HLA-DR, TdT and CD45 antigens remained unchanged in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support the requirement to monitor at least two different leukaemia specific antigen combinations for detection of MRD to prevent a false-negative result and to increase the effectiveness of monitoring minimal residual disease.","['Bulsa, Joanna', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, Danuta', 'Mazur, Bogdan', 'Sobol, Grazyna', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz']","['Bulsa J', 'Sedek L', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Mazur B', 'Sobol G', 'Szczepanski T']","['Katedra i Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii Dzieciecej, ul. 3 Maja 13/15, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland.']",['pol'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/01/01 00:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2008 Oct-Dec;12(4 Pt 2):1045-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,Analiza zmian immunofenotypu komorek bialaczkowych przy diagnozie oraz wznowie w dzieciecej ostrej bialaczce limfoblastycznej oraz ich wplywu na wykrywanie minimalnej choroby resztkowej.,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four children treated according to the ALLIC 2002 protocol entered the study. Blood samples were collected during the induction phase of treatment, on the 1st, 21st and 30(33)th day. The concentration of the total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides was determined. The results were analyzed in relation to the Body Mass Index, the WBC count and L-asparaginase activity. At the moment of diagnosis significantly low concentration of total cholesterol (124 mg/dl (103-153) vs 161 mg/dl (143-185), p=0,011) and HDL cholesterol (23 mg/dl (17-27) vs 56 mg/dl (44-64), p=0,00001) were observed, as well as high concentration of triglycerides (112 mg/dl (83-162) vs 73 mg/dl (62-99), p=0,009). The concentration of LDL cholesterol was similar to that observed in the control group. During further treatment the increase of the total cholesterol concentration was observed, but it was still significantly lower, when compared with the control. The values of triglycerides were significantly higher then those observed in healthy children (day 21: 88 mg/dl (67-170), p=0.08, day 33: 111 mg/dl (96-104) p=0.0004). The concentration of HDL cholesterol has increased during the treatment, but it was still lower than the HDL concentration in the control group (day 38: mg/dl (29-53), day 33: 30 mg/dl (16-50), p=0.009). No association between lipid concentration and BMI, WBC and L-asparaginase activity were found.

Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), inhibin B, testosterone and testicular volume were determined. RESULTS: In group I no alteration in hormonal status was observed, whereas in group II lower inhibin B was found (68.09 ng/l+/-54.87 vs 152.66 ng/l+/-72.09, p=0.0002). The levels of FSH, LH, testosterone and testicular volume did not differ from healthy adolescents. We did not observe a correlation between inhibin B and FSH concentrations. We did not find the influence of immunophenotype of leukaemic cells, leukocytosis, haemoglobin, platelets levels as well as LDH activity on the values of analyzed hormones. CONCLUSION: In adolescent boys with newly diagnosed leukaemia, lowered inhibin B values may suggest the damage of spermatogenesis even before the start of chemo- and radiotherapy.

AIM: Analysis of treatment outcome and identification of prognostic factors in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total number of 113 children aged 1.1-17.8 years (median age 5.5 years) were diagnosed for ALL in the Specialist Children Hospital of Olsztyn Province between 1991-2007. Children were treated in 6 consecutive protocols including 4 of the BFM group (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) and 2 of the modified American New York and New York II protocols. Probability of event-free survival (pEFS) was the principal indicator of effective of treatment in ALL. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimate of 17-year pEFS of all the 113 study patients was 0.72+/-0.05. The analysis of treatment results showed gradual improvement in the consecutive treatment protocols, including: pEFS=0.61+/-0.15 in the New York protocol; in the New York II - pEFS=0.76+/-0.15; in ALL-BFM-86 - pEFS=0,71+/-0,10; in ALL-BFM-90 - pEFS=0.79+/-0.08; in ALL-BFM-95 - pEFS=0.72+/-0.11. The protocol ALL-IC-2002 is ongoing. Prognostic factors for pEFS by univariate analysis were: male gender (p=0.003), age under 2 year (p=0.004), spleen enlargement (p=0.043), Hgb>10g/dl (p=0.025), WBC>100 G/L (p=0.007), FAB L2 (p<0.001), loss of weight p=0.022 and defects of eyesight (p=0.006) before the diagnosis of ALL, and HBV infection during the therapy (p=0.019). Independent risk factors by multivariate analysis were: male gender (p=0.005), age under 2 year (p=0.052), the spleen enlargement (p=0.028), WBC>100 G/L (p=0.007), FAB L2 (p=0.007), eyesight defects (p=0.009) before the diagnosis of ALL, and infection of HBV during the therapy (p=0.027).

Global hypomethylation of repetitive genomic sequences such as long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1), Alu and satellite alpha (SAT-alpha) sequences has been associated with chromosomal instability in cancer. Methylation status of repetitive elements in MM has never been investigated. In the present study, we used a quantitative bisulfite-polymerase chain reaction pyrosequencing method to evaluate the methylation patterns of LINE-1, Alu and SAT-alpha in 23 human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and purified bone marrow plasma cells from 53 newly diagnosed MM patients representative of different molecular subtypes, 7 plasma cell leukemias (PCLs) and 11 healthy controls. MMs showed a decrease of Alu [median: 21.1 %5-methylated cytosine (%5mC)], LINE-1 (70.0%5mC) and SAT-alpha (77.9%5mC) methylation levels compared with controls (25.2, 79.5and 89.5%5mC, respectively). Methylation levels were lower in PCLs and HMCLs compared with MMs (16.7 and 14.8%5mC for Alu, 45.5 and 42.4%5mC for LINE-1 and 33.3 and 43.3%5mC for SAT-alpha, respectively). Notably, LINE-1 and SAT-alpha methylation was significantly lower in the non-hyperdiploid versus hyperdiploid MMs (P = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively), whereas Alu and SAT-alpha methylation was significantly lower in MMs with t(4;14) (P = 0.02 and 0.004, respectively). Finally, we correlated methylation patterns with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) messenger RNA levels showing in particular a progressive and significant increase of DNMT1 expression from controls to MMs, PCLs and HMCLs (P < 0.001). Our results indicate that global hypomethylation of repetitive elements is significantly associated with tumor progression in MM and may contribute toward a more extensive stratification of the disease.","['Bollati, Valentina', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Pegoraro, Valeria', 'Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Motta, Valeria', 'Bertazzi, Pier Alberto', 'Baccarelli, Andrea', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Bollati V', 'Fabris S', 'Pegoraro V', 'Ronchetti D', 'Mosca L', 'Deliliers GL', 'Motta V', 'Bertazzi PA', 'Baccarelli A', 'Neri A']","['Center of Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology, EPOCA, Epidemiology Research Center, Universita degli Studi di Milano and Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Mangiagalli e Regina Elena, 20122 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090616,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alu Elements/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA, Satellite/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/06/18 09:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp149 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp149 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2009 Aug;30(8):1330-5. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp149.

The aim of this study, which included 353 patients with polycythemia vera and 467 with essential thrombocythemia, was to assess whether the risk of developing LPN is increased in MPN patients. Expected numbers of LPN incident cases were calculated based on 5-year age group, gender, and calendar time-specific cancer incidence rates in the general population of the same area. Standardized incidence ratios were computed to estimate the relative risk of developing LPN. Analyses were carried out for the whole series and then separately for essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, gender, and JAK2V617F genotype. With 4,421 person-years, we found 11 patients developing LPN, including four chronic lymphocytic leukemias, five non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and two plasma cell disorders, after a median interval time of 68 months from MPN diagnosis. Cumulative risk to develop LPN at 5 and 10 years was 0.93% (95% confidence interval, 0.39-2.22) and 2.96% (95% confidence interval, 1.52-5.72), respectively. There was a 3.44-fold increased risk of LPN compared with the general population, ranging from 2.86 for plasma cell disorder to 12.42 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia; the risk was significantly increased in JAK2V617F mutated patients (5.46-fold) and in males (4.52-fold). The JAK2V617F mutation was found in lymphoid tumor cells in two of three cases evaluated, indicating that, in some patients, LPN originated in a JAK2V617F mutated common lymphoid-myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cell. We conclude that the risk of developing LPN is significantly increased in MPN patients compared with the general population.","['Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Masala, Giovanna', 'Antonioli, Elisabetta', 'Chiara Susini, Maria', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Pieri, Lisa', 'Maggi, Laura', 'Caini, Saverio', 'Palli, Domenico', 'Bogani, Costanza', 'Ponziani, Vanessa', 'Pancrazzi, Alessandro', 'Annunziato, Francesco', 'Bosi, Alberto']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Masala G', 'Antonioli E', 'Chiara Susini M', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Pieri L', 'Maggi L', 'Caini S', 'Palli D', 'Bogani C', 'Ponziani V', 'Pancrazzi A', 'Annunziato F', 'Bosi A']","['Unita Funzionale di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Area Critica, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy. amvannucchi@unifi.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090616,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polycythemia Vera/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/18 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-09-0353 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0353 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2009 Jul;18(7):2068-73. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0353.

To obtain a broad view of the molecules involved in EMT, we carried out a comparative proteomic analysis of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced EMT in AML-12 murine hepatocytes. A total of 36 proteins with significant alterations in abundance were identified. Among these proteins, ferritin heavy chain (FHC), a cellular iron storage protein, was characterized as a novel modulator in TGF-beta1-induced EMT. In response to TGF-beta1, there was a dramatic decrease in the FHC levels, which caused iron release from FHC and, therefore, increased the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). Abolishing the increase in LIP blocked TGF-beta1-induced EMT. In addition, increased LIP levels promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The elimination of ROS inhibited EMT, whereas H2O2 treatment rescued TGF-beta1-induced EMT in cells in which the LIP increase was abrogated. Overexpression of exogenous FHC attenuated the increases in LIP and ROS production, leading to a suppression of EMT. We also showed that TGF-beta1-mediated down-regulation of FHC occurs via 3' untranslated region-dependent repression of the translation of FHC mRNA. Moreover, we found that FHC down-regulation is an event that occurs between the early and highly invasive advanced stages in esophageal adenocarcinoma and that depletion of LIP or ROS suppresses the migration of tumor cells. Our data show that cellular iron homeostasis regulated by FHC plays a critical role in TGF-beta1-induced EMT.","['Zhang, Ke-Hua', 'Tian, Hong-Yu', 'Gao, Xia', 'Lei, Wei-Wei', 'Hu, Ying', 'Wang, Dong-Mei', 'Pan, Xin-Chao', 'Yu, Mei-Lan', 'Xu, Gen-Jun', 'Zhao, Fu-Kun', 'Song, Jian-Guo']","['Zhang KH', 'Tian HY', 'Gao X', 'Lei WW', 'Hu Y', 'Wang DM', 'Pan XC', 'Yu ML', 'Xu GJ', 'Zhao FK', 'Song JG']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090616,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proteome)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '9013-31-4 (Apoferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Animals', 'Apoferritins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Deficiencies', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Proteome', 'RNA Interference', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/genetics/pharmacology/physiology']",2009/06/18 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0112 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0112 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 1;69(13):5340-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0112.

However, the functional significance in cell transformation remains to be elucidated. Here, we first identified two gene products, P58(TFL) and P36(TFL), derived by alternative splicing. The expression was prominent in normal human lymphocytes but defective in some leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. Overexpression of either protein in a mouse pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, and a human leukemia cell line, Jurkat, inhibited G(1) to S phase progression through suppression of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation. The dominant gene product, P58(TFL), colocalized with mRNA-processing body markers, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C and DCP1 decapping-enzyme homolog A, but not with a stress granule maker, T-cell intracellular antigen 1, in the cytoplasm. Taken together with the unique CCCH-type zinc finger motif, the present study suggests that P58(TFL) could play an important role in the regulation of cell growth through posttranscriptional modification of cell cycle regulators, at least partially, upstream of Rb.","['Minagawa, Kentaro', 'Katayama, Yoshio', 'Nishikawa, Shinichiro', 'Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Sada, Akiko', 'Okamura, Atsuo', 'Shimoyama, Manabu', 'Matsui, Toshimitsu']","['Minagawa K', 'Katayama Y', 'Nishikawa S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Sada A', 'Okamura A', 'Shimoyama M', 'Matsui T']","['Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090616,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'S Phase/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/*physiology']",2009/06/18 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/06/18 09:00'],"['2009/06/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-08-0511 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0511 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Jun;7(6):880-9. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0511.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients under 18 years of age from 22 institutions were enrolled from January 1995 to December 2000. Immunohistochemical expression of p53, HER/erbB-2 and P-glycoprotein were retrospectively studied in 27 patients. Treatment consisted of: preoperative chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue and ifosfamide for 14 weeks; surgery of primary tumour in week 16; postoperative chemotherapy with the above-mentioned drugs for 25 weeks. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 124 months (range 84-158 months), 69 patients (69%) were continuously event-free survivors; the 10-year probability of event-free survival (EFS) was 62%. Conservative surgery was performed in 85% of patients. Twenty-six patients had local recurrence or distant relapse. The median time to recurrence/ relapse was 27 months (range 17-93 months). The local recurrence rate was 7% (7 of the 100 patients); 4 had wide surgical margins, 2 marginal and 1 intralesional. Four patients died as a result of chemotherapy-related toxicity and 1 developed a second neoplasia (acute myeloid leukaemia). p53 expression and HER2/erbB-2 expression showed no effect on survival or EFS. CONCLUSIONS: This therapeutic protocol achieved good oncologic and orthopaedic results.

Informative karyotypic results were obtained in 249 (87%) cases, of which 119 (48%) were cytogenetically abnormal. Most (62%) of the aberrant T-ALLs were pseudodiploid. Structural changes were more common than numerical ones; 86% displayed at least one structural abnormality and 41% at least one numerical anomaly. The most frequent abnormalities were T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements (20%) [TCR;11p13 (10%), TCR;10q24 (3%), TCR;other (8%)], del(9p) (17%), +8 (14%), del(6q) (12%), and 11q23 rearrangements (6%). The TCR;other group comprised the rare rearrangements t(X;14)(p11;q11), t(X;7)(q22;q34), t(1;14)(p32;q11), ins(14;5)(q11;q?q?), inv(7)(p15q34), t(8;14)(q24;q11), t(7;11)(q34;p15), and t(12;14)(p13;q11). The clinical characteristics of this Nordic patient cohort agreed well with previous larger series, with a median age of 9.0 years, male predominance (male/female ratio 3.1), median white blood cell (WBC) count of 66.5 x 10(9)/l, and a high incidence of mediastinal mass and central nervous system involvement (59% and 9.5%, respectively). These features did not differ significantly among the various genetic subgroups. 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival for all patients were 0.61 (+/-0.03) and 0.67 (+/-0.03), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, two factors affected negatively the EFS, namely a WBC count of > or =200 x 10(9)/l (P < 0.001) and the presence of rare TCR rearrangements (P = 0.001). In conclusion, in this large series of childhood T-ALLs from the Nordic countries, the cytogenetic findings were not associated with risk of therapy failure with the exception of the TCR;other group.

To address this, blood samples were taken from breast cancer and lymphoma patients receiving Topoisomerase II inhibitor therapy. Inverse PCR analysis was used to interrogate the exon 12 region of MLL for rearrangements. Eleven of 19 observed translocations showed breakpoint junctions restricted to a single 5 bp location within exon 12. A similarly restricted distribution (11/20 breakpoint junctions) was observed in TK6 cells exposed to either estrogen (linked to IAL) or anti-CD95 antibody. The translocation hotspot was at the 5' edge of a 10-bp tract matched with a perfect palindrome, 101 bp distant. A high stringency Topoisomerase II consensus sequence binding site was noted at the geometric midpoint of the palindromes. Ligation-mediated PCR to screen TK6 cells exposed to anti-CD95 antibody showed 14/37 (38%) of DNA breaks adjacent to the 5' palindrome and 10/37 (27%) at the 3' partner.

Recent studies have also implicated Dax-1 in the transcriptional network controlling embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. Here, we show that Dax-1 expression is affected by differentiating treatments and pharmacological activation of beta-catenin-dependent transcription in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, Dax-1 knockdown induced upregulation of multilineage differentiation markers, and produced enhanced differentiation and defects in ES viability and proliferation. Through RNA interference and transcriptome analysis, we have identified genes regulated by Dax-1 in mouse ES cells at 24 and 48 hours after knockdown. Strikingly, the great majority of these genes are upregulated, showing that the prevalent function of Dax-1 is to act as a transcriptional repressor in mouse ES cells, as confirmed by experiments using the Gal4 system. Genes involved in tissue differentiation and control of proliferation are significantly enriched among Dax-1-regulated transcripts. These data show that Dax-1 is an essential element in the molecular circuit involved in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency and have implications for the understanding of stem cell function in both physiological (adrenal gland) and clinical (Ewing tumors) settings where Dax-1 plays a pivotal role in development and pathogenesis, respectively.","['Khalfallah, Olfa', 'Rouleau, Matthieu', 'Barbry, Pascal', 'Bardoni, Barbara', 'Lalli, Enzo']","['Khalfallah O', 'Rouleau M', 'Barbry P', 'Bardoni B', 'Lalli E']","['Institut de Pharmacologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire CNRS UMR 6097, Valbonne, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nr0b1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/10/31 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.78 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Jul;27(7):1529-37. doi: 10.1002/stem.78.,10.1002/stem.78 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a phase I dose-escalation trial using clinical-grade manufactured mature RNA-electroporated DC in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. METHODS: CD14(+) cells were isolated from leukapheresis products by immunomagnetic CliniMACS separation and differentiated into mature DC (mDC). mDC were electroporated with clinical-grade mRNA encoding the Wilm's tumor (WT1) antigen, and tested for viability, phenotype, sterility and recovery. To test product safety, increasing doses of DC were administered intradermally four times at 2-week intervals in 10 AML patients. RESULTS: In a pre-clinical phase, immunomagnetic monocyte isolation proved superior over plastic adherence in terms of DC purity and lymphocyte contamination. We also validated a simplified DC maturation protocol yielding a consistent phenotype, migration and allogeneic T-cell stimulatory capacity in AML patients in remission. In the clinical trial, highly purified CD14(+) cells (94.5+/-3.4%) were obtained from all patients. A monocyte-to-mDC conversion factor of 25+/-10% was reached. All DC preparations exhibited high expression of mDC markers. Despite a decreased cell recovery of mDC after a combination of mRNA electroporation and cryopreservation, successful vaccine preparations were obtained in all AML patients. DC injections were well tolerated by all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our method yields a standardized, simplified and reproducible preparation of multiple doses of clinical-grade mRNA-transfected DC vaccines from a single apheresis with consistent mature phenotype, recovery, sterility and viability. Intradermal injection of such DC vaccines in AML patients is safe.","['Van Driessche, Ann', 'Van de Velde, Ann L R', 'Nijs, Griet', 'Braeckman, Tessa', 'Stein, Barbara', 'De Vries, Jolanda M', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F I']","['Van Driessche A', 'Van de Velde AL', 'Nijs G', 'Braeckman T', 'Stein B', 'De Vries JM', 'Berneman ZN', 'Van Tendeloo VF']","['Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VIDI), Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', '*Electroporation', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Injections', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['912415451 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240902960411 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2009;11(5):653-68. doi: 10.1080/14653240902960411.,10.1080/14653240902960411 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characterization of distribution patterns of different subtypes of leukemia in Nepal needs further study. We wanted to study the leukemia pattern in our institute. METHODS: A retrospective study of 196 cases of leukemia, diagnosed at BPKIHS, between January 1997 to December 2002 was done. We analyzed the pattern of leukemia at BPKIHS by morphological subtype, gender, age at diagnosis, time period of diagnosis (seasonality), and geographic distribution. RESULTS: Morphological sub typing showed that 121 cases were of acute leukemia and 75 of chronic leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia constituted the single largest group comprising 35.2 % of all cases, followed by acute myeloid leukemia (28.57 %) and acute lymphoid leukemia (19.9 %). Maximum numbers of cases were from the lowlands while least number of cases were from the mountain districts. Results were compared with literature from Nepal and other countries. This is the second series of leukemia from Nepal. CONCLUSIONS: The data published in this study reflects the leukemia pattern in the eastern region of Nepal.

These screens are most effective when performed using hundreds of mice; however, until recently, the cost-effective isolation and sequencing of insertion sites has been a major limitation to performing screens on this scale. Here we present a method for the high-throughput isolation of insertion sites using a highly efficient splinkerette-PCR method coupled with capillary or 454 sequencing. This protocol includes a description of the procedure for DNA isolation, DNA digestion, linker or splinkerette ligation, primary and secondary PCR amplification, and sequencing. This method, which takes about 1 week to perform, has allowed us to isolate hundreds of thousands of insertion sites from mouse tumors and, unlike other methods, has been specifically optimized for the murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and can easily be performed in a 96-well plate format for the efficient multiplex isolation of insertion sites.","['Uren, Anthony G', 'Mikkers, Harald', 'Kool, Jaap', 'van der Weyden, Louise', 'Lund, Anders H', 'Wilson, Catherine H', 'Rance, Richard', 'Jonkers, Jos', 'van Lohuizen, Maarten', 'Berns, Anton', 'Adams, David J']","['Uren AG', 'Mikkers H', 'Kool J', 'van der Weyden L', 'Lund AH', 'Wilson CH', 'Rance R', 'Jonkers J', 'van Lohuizen M', 'Berns A', 'Adams DJ']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Cancer Genomics Centre, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['098051/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'A6542/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090430,England,Nat Protoc,Nature protocols,101284307,,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Virus Integration']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['nprot.2009.64 [pii]', '10.1038/nprot.2009.64 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Protoc. 2009;4(5):789-98. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2009.64.

Additionally, 15-LO-1 was detected on neutral lipid droplets isolated from THP-1 foam cells. To investigate if 15-LO-1 is active on lipid droplets, we used the mouse leukemic monocytic macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7), which are stably transfected with human 15-LO-1. The RAW 15-LO-1 cells were incubated with acetylated low density lipoprotein to generate foam cells. 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE], the major 15-LO-1 metabolite of arachidonic acid, was produced in the 15-LO-1 RAW but not in the mock transfected cells when incubated with arachidonic acid. Lipid droplets were isolated from the cells and incubated with arachidonic acid, and production of 15(S)-HETE was measured over 2 h. 15(S)-HETE was produced in the incubations with the lipid droplets, and this production was attenuated when the lipid droplet fraction was subjected to enzyme inactivation through heating. Efflux of 15(S)-HETE from cholesteryl ester-enriched 15-LO RAW cells, when lipid droplets are present, was significantly reduced compared with that from cells enriched with free cholesterol (lipid droplets are absent). We propose that 15-LO-1 is present and functional on cytoplasmic neutral lipid droplets in macrophage foam cells, and these droplets may act to accumulate the anti-inflammatory lipid mediator 15(S)-HETE.","['Weibel, Ginny L', 'Joshi, Michelle R', 'Wei, Cong', 'Bates, Sandra R', 'Blair, Ian A', 'Rothblat, George H']","['Weibel GL', 'Joshi MR', 'Wei C', 'Bates SR', 'Blair IA', 'Rothblat GH']","[""Division of Gastroenterology and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. weibel@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['HL-19737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL019737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES013508/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA091016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL022633/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-22633/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES013508/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA091016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090615,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Lipids)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (ALOX15 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Foam Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/06/17 09:00,2010/03/24 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2275(20)30660-X [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M900081-JLR200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2009 Dec;50(12):2371-6. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M900081-JLR200.

In most cases, the MLL gene is involved, and more than 50 translocation partners have been described. Clinical outcome data of the 11q23-rearranged subgroups are scarce because most 11q23 series are too small for meaningful analysis of subgroups, although some studies suggest that patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23) have a more favorable prognosis. We retrospectively collected outcome data of 756 children with 11q23- or MLL-rearranged AML from 11 collaborative groups to identify differences in outcome based on translocation partners. All karyotypes were centrally reviewed before assigning patients to subgroups. The event-free survival of 11q23/MLL-rearranged pediatric AML at 5 years from diagnosis was 44% (+/- 5%), with large differences across subgroups (11% +/- 5% to 92% +/- 5%). Multivariate analysis identified the following subgroups as independent prognostic predictors: t(1;11)(q21;q23) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.1, P = .004); t(6;11)(q27;q23) (HR = 2.2, P < .001); t(10;11)(p12;q23) (HR = 1.5, P = .005); and t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) (HR = 2.5, P = .005). We could not confirm the favorable prognosis of the t(9;11)(p22;q23) subgroup. We identified large differences in outcome within 11q23/MLL-rearranged pediatric AML and novel subgroups based on translocation partners that independently predict clinical outcome. Screening for these translocation partners is needed for accurate treatment stratification at diagnosis.","['Balgobind, Brian V', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Chang, Myron', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Leszl, Anna', 'Litvinko, Nathalia', 'Nigro, Luca Lo', 'Morimoto, Akira', 'Perot, Christine', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Stary, Jan', 'Stasevich, Irina', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Webb, David', 'Zemanova, Zuzana', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['Balgobind BV', 'Raimondi SC', 'Harbott J', 'Zimmermann M', 'Alonzo TA', 'Auvrignon A', 'Beverloo HB', 'Chang M', 'Creutzig U', 'Dworzak MN', 'Forestier E', 'Gibson B', 'Hasle H', 'Harrison CJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Leszl A', 'Litvinko N', 'Nigro LL', 'Morimoto A', 'Perot C', 'Pieters R', 'Reinhardt D', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Smith FO', 'Stary J', 'Stasevich I', 'Strehl S', 'Taga T', 'Tomizawa D', 'Webb D', 'Zemanova Z', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090615,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'International Agencies', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36918-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-215152 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Sep 17;114(12):2489-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-215152.

Expression methods have been limited to gene transfer using viral vectors and enzymatic manipulation. We report here a novel method using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to induce plasma membrane fusion between malignant human hematological cells and alphaGal(+) porcine blood cells (PBC) in order to display alphaGal antigens on human cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Freshly isolated white blood cells (WBC) were obtained from patients with malignant hematological disease and combined with diluted PBC. Cell mixtures were labeled with human CD mAbs, followed by IB4 lectin or M86 mAb to detect alphaGal antigens and then co-incubated with PEG. Back-gated, dual-color flow cytometry was used to detect alphaGal on human cells. RESULTS: alphaGal antigens were detected on sizeable numbers of human WBC (approximately 45%) after incubation with PEG. Antigen expression was profuse as assessed by the strong fluorescent intensity demonstrated by IB4-FITC and M86 labeling. Human cells combined with PBC without PEG were not reactive with IB4-FITC or M86. CONCLUSION: Our method provides an effective, highly reproducible means to efficiently express alphaGal antigens on cells obtained from patients with a spectrum of hematological malignancies. This method can provide a simple, safe alternative to viral-mediated gene transfer or enzymatic alteration to express alphaGal antigens on human tumor cells. By virtue of its simplicity, our technique presents a novel approach to the preparation of polyvalent autologous or syngeneic anticancer vaccines.","['Posekany, Karla J', 'Wiley, John E', 'Gagnon, Gregory A']","['Posekany KJ', 'Wiley JE', 'Gagnon GA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical Genetics, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University Greenville, Greenville, North Carolina 27834, U.S.A.

The effect exerted upon gene expression was studied in K562 cells by Q-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment with Ribavirin resulted in a significant growth inhibition (IC(50)=15 microM) via activating apoptosis and the differentiation pathway in K562 cells. It also modulated the expression of about 60 out of 85 genes having roles in cell proliferation, purine biosynthesis, translation initiation, oncogenic signaling and cell survival (p<0.05).

In the majority of EFT, EWSR1-FLI1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-Friend leukaemia virus integration 1) fusion proteins can be detected and EWSR1-FLI1 substantially contributes to the malignant phenotype of EFT. Therefore, inactivation of EWSR1-FLI1 is an interesting strategy for EFT therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A ribozyme with specificity for EWSR1-FLI1 was developed and the activity in vitro was investigated. Synthetic RNAs corresponding to EWSR1-FLI1 were used as substrates. In addition, the total RNA from EFT cells was used as substrate and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method for the detection of the cleavage products was used. RESULTS: The ribozyme cleaved the synthetic RNA in a sequence specific manner with high efficiency in vitro. Furthermore, the expected cleavage products were detected after digestion of the total cellular RNA with this ribozyme. A point mutation in the catalytic centre of the ribozyme abolished enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION: The RNA corresponding to EWSR1-FLI1 is accessible for ribozyme mediated inactivation and ribozymes are able to cleave EWSR1-FLI1 specific RNA in the presence of a high background of normal cellular RNAs.","['Huhn, Regina', 'Staege, Martin S', 'Hesse, Manuela', 'Liebig, Beate', 'Burdach, Stefan E G']","['Huhn R', 'Staege MS', 'Hesse M', 'Liebig B', 'Burdach SE']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Children's Cancer Research Centre, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, D-06097 Halle, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EWSR1 protein, human)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (hammerhead ribozyme)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['29/6/1901 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2009 Jun;29(6):1901-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have found that telomeres are transcribed into telomeric UUAGGG repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) starting from subtelomeric regions. TERRA binding at telomeres appears to be involved in cis-based mechanisms of telomeric chromatin organization and maintenance. A number of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are known to influence telomeric chromatin status; however, the regulatory mechanisms of telomere transcription are poorly understood. Here, we show that the histone 3/lysine 4 (H3/K4) HMT and the transcriptional regulator MLL associate with telomeres and contribute to their H3/K4 methylation and transcription in a telomere length-dependent manner. In human diploid fibroblasts, RNA interference-mediated MLL depletion affects telomere chromatin modification and transcription and induces the telomere damage response. Telomere uncapping through either TRF2 shelterin protein knockdown or exposure to telomere G-strand DNA oligonucleotides significantly increases the transcription of TERRA, an effect mediated by the functional cooperation between MLL and the tumor suppressor p53. In total, our findings identify a previously unrecognized role of MLL in modifying telomeric chromatin and provide evidence for the functional interaction between MLL, p53, and the shelterin complex in the regulation of telomeric transcription and stability.","['Caslini, Corrado', 'Connelly, James A', 'Serna, Amparo', 'Broccoli, Dominique', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Caslini C', 'Connelly JA', 'Serna A', 'Broccoli D', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, 5214B Medical Science I, 1301 Catherine Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0602, USA. ccaslini@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],['R01 CA092251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090615,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Centromere/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Heterochromatin/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Shelterin Complex', '*Telomere/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00195-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00195-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Aug;29(16):4519-26. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00195-09.

Murine hematopoietic progenitors expressing activating Shp2 undergo myelomonocytic differentiation, despite being subjected to conditions that normally support only mast cells. Evaluation of hematopoietic-specific transcription factor expression indicates reduced GATA2 and elevated c-Jun in mutant Shp2-expressing progenitors. We hypothesized that mutant Shp2-induced Ras hyperactivation promotes c-Jun phosphorylation and constitutive c-Jun expression, permitting, as a coactivator of PU.1, excessive monocytic differentiation and reduced GATA2. Hematopoietic progenitors expressing activating Shp2 demonstrate enhanced macrophage CFU (CFU-M) compared to that of wild-type Shp2-expressing cells. Treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or cotransduction with GATA2 normalizes activating Shp2-generated CFU-M. However, cotransduction of DeltaGATA2 (lacking the C-terminal zinc finger, needed to bind PU.1) fails to normalize CFU-M. NIH 3T3 cells expressing Shp2E76K produce higher levels of luciferase expression directed by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (MCSFR) promoter, which utilizes c-Jun as a coactivator of PU.1. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrates increased c-Jun-PU.1 complexes in mutant Shp2-expressing hematopoietic progenitors, while chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates increased c-Jun binding to the c-Jun promoter and an increased c-Jun-PU.1 complex at the Mcsfr promoter. Furthermore, JMML progenitors express higher levels of c-JUN than healthy controls, substantiating the disease relevance of these mechanistic findings.","['Yang, Zhenyun', 'Kondo, Takako', 'Voorhorst, Cara S', 'Nabinger, Sarah C', 'Ndong, Leila', 'Yin, Fuqin', 'Chan, Edward M', 'Yu, Menggang', 'Wurstlin, Oliver', 'Kratz, Christian P', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Hashino, Eri', 'Chan, Rebecca J']","['Yang Z', 'Kondo T', 'Voorhorst CS', 'Nabinger SC', 'Ndong L', 'Yin F', 'Chan EM', 'Yu M', 'Wurstlin O', 'Kratz CP', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Flotho C', 'Hashino E', 'Chan RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DC007390/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082981/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DC007390/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL082981/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090615,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Child', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics', 'Mast Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/*physiology', '*Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01330-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01330-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Aug;29(16):4376-93. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01330-08.

Even through this human disease can be treated by the intravenous administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 25% of patients typically relapse after the first treatment. In this context, the intravenous administration of APL patients with an aqueous solution of arsenic trioxide has also been demonstrated to be successful despite the established mammalian toxicity of this arsenic compound. Accordingly, the administration of a therapeutic dose of arsenic trioxide has resulted in an improved patient survival in both relapsing as well newly diagnosed APL patients. We present here a mini-review of the medicinal use of arsenite, its mammalian metabolism (with an emphasis on biomethylation pathways), its elimination and pharmacokinetics and the novel application of hair analysis as a biomonitoring material. This mini-review also introduces our own results on the analysis of hair of patients receiving arsenic trioxide therapy. In this work, instead of quantifying arsenic content in bulk hair, we performed longitudinal analysis in order to use hair as a marker of arsenic exposure correlated to a time scale. Taking into account the hair growth rate, the longitudinal analysis of hair is demonstrated to provide a chronological record of the treatment of patients with arsenic trioxide. The small quantity of material to be analysed required the use of Synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) spectroscopy. The hair arsenic content was well correlated with the clinical background of patients and reflected the intake of arsenic trioxide. In particular, the onset of arsenic trioxide therapy and interruptions during therapy were reflected by total arsenic content, which suggested rapid elimination. Another type of experiment, micro-XRF cartography on thin hair slices, allowed us to obtain distribution maps of arsenic, which demonstrated that arsenic is located at the periphery of hair. Micro-XANES spectra recorded at the periphery of hair, suggest that inorganic arsenic is incorporated in hair in its trivalent oxidation state, in agreement with previous results.","['Nicolis, I', 'Curis, E', 'Deschamps, P', 'Benazeth, S']","['Nicolis I', 'Curis E', 'Deschamps P', 'Benazeth S']","['Laboratoire de Biomathematiques, EA 2498, Departement de Sante Publique et Biostatistiques, Plateau iB(2), Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France. ioannis.nicolis@parisdescartes.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090613,France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (Arsenites)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Arsenites/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Hair/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission']",2009/06/17 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0300-9084(09)00160-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2009.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2009 Oct;91(10):1260-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2009.06.003.

METHODS: Subjects were selected from leukemia patients who achieved hematological complete remission (HCR) but not achieved molecular biological remission (MBR), or with minimal residual leukemia (MRL) positive. Twenty patients, 19 of acute leukemia and 1 of chronic myelocytic leukemia, were enrolled. DC and CIK from patient's peripheral blood monocyte were separated respectively by blood cell separator, then DC-CIK was obtained through respective culture followed with mixed cultivation of them, and was infused back to the patient self via intravenous injection. The back infusion of DC-CIK was performed once every 15-20 days for 4-6 times in total. Meantime, LDK was administered orally every day. RESULTS: In the 20 patients treated, 4 case of HCR achieved MBR, the negatively reversed marker gene was AML1/ETO in 1 case, CBFbeta/MYH11 in 1, bcr/abl in 1, and the other 1 was IgH gene rearrangement; 3 patients with positive MRL were reversed to negative. The 3-year CR rate was 75% with a medium CR period of 25 months (10-37 months). Except transient fever and chill in 5 cases, no other remarkable adverse reaction happened during or after DC-CIK infusion. CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of LDK and autologous DC-CIK in treating patients with HCR shows an obvious effect of clearing MRL, it is the appropriate choice for curing leukemia of HCR, and is safety for intravenous infusion, so it has potential clinical prospect.","['Liu, Qing-Chi', 'Wu, Wei-Hai', 'Li, Gang-Rong']","['Liu QC', 'Wu WH', 'Li GR']","[""Department of Hematology, Ping'an Hospital, Shijiazhuang liuqingchi@sina.com""]",['chi'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/cytology/*transplantation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*transplantation', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Phytotherapy', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/17 09:00,2010/05/27 06:00,['2009/06/17 09:00'],"['2009/06/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2009 Apr;29(4):347-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The slides were blinded and the study participants (one hematopathologist, two cytopathologists, and one cytotechnologist) reviewed the key slides of each case without additional information. These diagnoses were compared with the original diagnoses made in the context of clinical information and ancillary studies. The spectrum of disease ranged from acute myeloid leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, large cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Parallel diagnoses were made in 62.5% of the cases. Interestingly, the correct diagnoses were rendered in 73% of benign cases, compared with 52% of malignant cases. Of the malignant cases, there was a higher proportion of correct diagnosis based on morphology in the acute malignancies (67%) versus the chronic malignancies (47%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 73, 52, 60, and 66% respectively. Features most useful for diagnosis of malignancy included cellular monotony and nuclear contour irregularity. The diagnosis of malignancy based on morphology alone is difficult in CSF.

In low- and middle-income countries, however, economic factors prevent many patients from receiving complete treatment, even as government and insurance entities lack complete data on the costs for ALL therapies. Here, we analyzed the overall costs for pediatric ALL therapies and their constitutive elements. PROCEDURE: All cost information was drawn from our hospital database. We analyzed the costs of 45 newly diagnosed children with ALL from May 2005 to June 2006; 20 were classified into low-risk group, 25 into medium-risk group, and all had completed the ALL-2005 protocol treatment. Forty cases were B-lineage, four were T-lineage, and one was double-lymphoid lineage. RESULTS: Average total clinic expense per person was US $3,694.58 +/- 1,376.85. Average total in-hospital expense per patient was US $7,299.48 +/- 6,526.39, with a large individual difference. Medicine and laboratory test costs represented 40.5% and 21.5%, respectively. Patients stayed at home or attended clinic for more than 90% of the therapy period. In-hospital and clinic constituted 66.4% and 33.6% of costs, respectively. Costs among risk groups and with/without severe complications differed significantly (P < 0.05). Thirty-month event-free survivals were 94.14% and 82.81% for the low- and medium-risk groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Risk group and severe complications were main factors affecting total medical costs. Average overall costs for childhood ALL in this study were less than US $11,000, with reasonable clinical results.","['Liu, Yin', 'Chen, Jing', 'Tang, JingYan', 'Ni, Shengxing', 'Xue, Huiliang', 'Pan, Ci']","['Liu Y', 'Chen J', 'Tang J', 'Ni S', 'Xue H', 'Pan C']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/economics/*therapy']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22127 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Oct;53(4):557-62. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22127.,10.1002/pbc.22127 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In JB6 mouse epidermal cells, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induces an unusually efficient and reversible AIG response, relative to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced AIG which is irreversible. The reversible and irreversible AIG phenotypes are characterized by largely nonoverlapping global gene expression profiles. However, a subset of differentially expressed genes were identified as common to reversible and irreversible AIG phenotypes, including genes regulated in a reciprocal fashion. Hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) and D-site albumin promoter-binding protein (DBP) were increased in both bFGF and TPA soft agar colonies and selected for functional validation. Ectopic expression of human HLF and DBP in JB6 cells resulted in a marked increase in TPA- and bFGF-regulated AIG responses. HLF and DBP expression were increased in soft agar colonies arising from JB6 cells exposed to gamma radiation and in a human basal cell carcinoma tumor tissue, relative to paired nontumor tissue. Subsequent biological network analysis suggests that many of the differentially expressed genes that are common to bFGF- and TPA-dependent AIG are regulated by c-Myc, SP-1, and HNF-4 transcription factors. Collectively, we have identified a potential molecular switch that mediates the transition from reversible to irreversible AIG.","['Waters, Katrina M', 'Tan, Ruimin', 'Opresko, Lee K', 'Quesenberry, Ryan D', 'Bandyopadhyay, Somnath', 'Chrisler, William B', 'Weber, Thomas J']","['Waters KM', 'Tan R', 'Opresko LK', 'Quesenberry RD', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Chrisler WB', 'Weber TJ']","['Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Groups, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DBP protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20558 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2009 Nov;48(11):1059-69. doi: 10.1002/mc.20558.,10.1002/mc.20558 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to systematically analyze the expression of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor subunits in various human cancer cell lines, compare expression levels to those in human brain tissue and, using electrophysiological techniques, explore whether cancer cells respond to glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists. Expression analysis of glutamate receptor subunits NR1-NR3B, GluR1-GluR7, KA1, KA2 and mGluR1-mGluR8 was performed by means of RT-PCR in human rhabdomyosarcoma/medulloblastoma (TE671), neuroblastoma (SK-NA-S), thyroid carcinoma (FTC 238), lung carcinoma (SK-LU-1), astrocytoma (MOGGCCM), multiple myeloma (RPMI 8226), glioma (U87-MG and U343), lung carcinoma (A549), colon adenocarcinoma (HT 29), T cell leukemia cells (Jurkat E6.1), breast carcinoma (T47D) and colon adenocarcinoma (LS180). Analysis revealed that all glutamate receptor subunits were differentially expressed in the tumor cell lines. For the majority of tumors, expression levels of NR2B, GluR4, GluR6 and KA2 were lower compared to human brain tissue. Confocal imaging revealed that selected glutamate receptor subunit proteins were expressed in tumor cells. By means of patch-clamp analysis, it was shown that A549 and TE671 cells depolarized in response to application of glutamate agonists and that this effect was reversed by glutamate receptor antagonists. This study reveals that glutamate receptor subunits are differentially expressed in human tumor cell lines at the mRNA and the protein level, and that their expression is associated with the formation of functional channels. The potential role of glutamate receptor antagonists in cancer therapy is a feasible goal to be explored in clinical trials.","['Stepulak, Andrzej', 'Luksch, Hella', 'Gebhardt, Christine', 'Uckermann, Ortrud', 'Marzahn, Jenny', 'Sifringer, Marco', 'Rzeski, Wojciech', 'Staufner, Christian', 'Brocke, Katja S', 'Turski, Lechoslaw', 'Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy']","['Stepulak A', 'Luksch H', 'Gebhardt C', 'Uckermann O', 'Marzahn J', 'Sifringer M', 'Rzeski W', 'Staufner C', 'Brocke KS', 'Turski L', 'Ikonomidou C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin 20-093, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090614,Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,"['0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, AMPA)', '0 (Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate)', '0 (metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1)', '6OTE87SCCW (6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione)', '76326-31-3 (2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)', 'TFZ3H25BS1 (glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 1)']",IM,"['6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione/pharmacology', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Protein Subunits/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, AMPA/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Valine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2009/06/16 09:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00418-009-0613-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 2009 Oct;132(4):435-45. doi: 10.1007/s00418-009-0613-1.

In addition to intellectual disability, many other health problems, such as congenital heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, hypotonia, motor disorders, and various physical anomalies occur at an elevated frequency in people with DS. On the other hand, people with DS seem to be at a decreased risk of certain cancers and perhaps of atherosclerosis. There is wide variability in the phenotypes associated with DS. Although ultimately the phenotypes of DS must be due to trisomy of HSA21, the genetic mechanisms by which the phenotypes arise are not understood. The recent recognition that there are many genetically active elements that do not encode proteins makes the situation more complex. Additional complexity may exist due to possible epigenetic changes that may act differently in DS. Numerous mouse models with features reminiscent of those seen in individuals with DS have been produced and studied in some depth, and these have added considerable insight into possible genetic mechanisms behind some of the phenotypes. These mouse models allow experimental approaches, including attempts at therapy, that are not possible in humans.

Modulation of the relative frequency and expression intensity of the NK-cell receptors by IL-15 may increase NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer patients. We investigated the receptor repertoire and measured NK-cell activity in newly diagnosed AML patients and evaluated the ex vivo effects of IL-15. The expression of the activating NK cell receptors was significantly decreased in the AML patients compared to that in NK cells of healthy donors. When NK cells obtained from AML patients were cultured with IL-15, expression of the activating receptors was significantly upregulated compared to pre-culture levels. Concomitantly, cytotoxic activity of NK cells against autologous leukemic blasts increased following IL-15 stimulation. This IL-15 induced increase in activity was blocked by neutralizing antibodies specific for the NK cell activating receptors. These pre-clinical data support the future use of IL-15 for NK cell- based therapies for AML patients.","['Szczepanski, Miroslaw J', 'Szajnik, Marta', 'Welsh, Ann', 'Foon, Kenneth A', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Szczepanski MJ', 'Szajnik M', 'Welsh A', 'Foon KA', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 5150 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.']",['eng'],"['N01HB37165/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-37165/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090613,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0724-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Jan;59(1):73-9. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0724-5.

The purpose of this paper is to study whether the incidence of other childhood cancers also increases with birth weight. METHODS: The Norwegian Medical Birth Registry was linked to the Norwegian Cancer Registry. The data consisted of 1.65 million children, of whom 3252 had a cancer diagnosis before age 16 years. The diagnoses were divided into 1010 leukemia cases, 870 cancer cases of the central nervous system (CNS), and 1370 remaining cancers. RESULTS: The increase in hazard rate for all cancers with a 1 kg increase in birth weight was 1.23 (95% confidence interval = 1.14-1.32) after adjustment. For leukemia the increase was 1.29 (1.14-1.47), for CNS cancers 1.07 (0.93-1.23), and for the remaining cancer diagnoses 1.29 (1.16-1.40).

However, the relationship between pulmonary infections and HTLV-I infection is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: A large-scale retrospective study was conducted on hospital inpatients to evaluate the relationship between community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and HTLV-I infection. METHODS: The present study included 4,666 hospitalized patients during 1991-2007. Three hundred and thirteen of them were diagnosed as CAP. The presence of serum HTLV-I antibody was determined in all patients on admission. Prevalence of HTLV-I infection was analyzed between CAP patients and all inpatients. We also compared HTLV-I-positive CAP patients and HTLV-I-negative CAP patients for severity and manifestation of pneumonia. RESULTS: The prevalence of HTLV-I was higher in CAP patients than in all inpatients (18.9%: 13.7%, p=0.011). The rates of renal diseases and collagen vascular disorders were higher in the HTLV-I-positive CAP patients than in the HTLV-I-negative CAP patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that HTLV-I infection, gender, COPD and collagen vascular disorders were all independent risk factors for CAP. The severity indices of CAP, the PORT score and the CURB-65 score, were higher in the HTLV-I-positive patients than in the HTLV-I-negative patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HTLV-I infection might be an independent risk factor for CAP and that HTLV-I-infected patients tend to demonstrate a relatively severe form of pneumonia.","['Atsumi, Eriko', 'Yara, Satomi', 'Higa, Futoshi', 'Hirata, Tetsuo', 'Haranaga, Shusaku', 'Tateyama, Masao', 'Fujita, Jiro']","['Atsumi E', 'Yara S', 'Higa F', 'Hirata T', 'Haranaga S', 'Tateyama M', 'Fujita J']","['Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Control and Prevention of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa. eriko-a@sj8.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090615,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Community-Acquired Infections/epidemiology/*etiology/immunology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pneumonia/epidemiology/*etiology/immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/48.1918 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.48.1918 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2009;48(12):959-65. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.48.1918.

Thirty-three samples were selected from a larger study of 107 cases of acute myeloid leukemia by screening for CEBPA mutations by sequence analysis. Of ten identified mutations, six (insertions and deletions) were detected by both sequencing and fragment methods. The fragment analysis method did not detect the remaining four base substitutions because the method cannot detect changes that result in identically sized products. The multiplex PCR fragment length analysis method therefore failed to detect substitution mutations accounting for 40% of total CEBPA mutations in our patient set. Our results indicate that fragment length analysis should not be used in isolation, and that direct sequencing is required to evaluate CEBPA gene mutational status in acute myeloid leukemia. A combination of the two assays may offer some advantages, chiefly in permitting more sensitive detection by fragment length analysis of insertions and deletions.","['Ahn, Jeung-Yeal', 'Seo, Katie', 'Weinberg, Olga', 'Boyd, Scott D', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Ahn JY', 'Seo K', 'Weinberg O', 'Boyd SD', 'Arber DA']","['Department of Pathology,Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California. jyahn@gilhospital.co']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20090612,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60245-0 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2009 Jul;11(4):319-23. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080121.

After 14 doses of the 6th cycle of treatment he experienced severe acute pain in various parts of the oral cavity. Extensive examination including an orthodontic review concluded there was no indication that the pain symptoms were due to a dental or endodontic cause. Four days after completing his 6th cycle the pain completely resolved. The mechanism of this adverse event remains unclear.

CCyR represents a critical level of disease reduction irrespective of treatment type, and timely achievement demonstrates treatment-sensitive disease. Guidelines from European LeukemiaNet and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network therefore state that alternative therapies should be considered for patients not achieving CCyR by 6 or 12 months. Data from clinical trials indicate that early CCyR affords the best benefit:risk ratio by minimizing the mounting risk of disease progression, and the duration of CCyR when achieved affects disease progression. Treatment options for patients who fail to achieve CCyR on standard-dose imatinib (400 mg/day) include imatinib dose escalation, dasatinib, nilotinib, stem-cell transplantation, or a clinical trial. While molecular testing gauges further risk reduction, disease stability, and often elimination of BCR-ABL transcripts below detection threshold, CCyR remains the most important surrogate for long-term survival and cytogenetic testing remains a key part of patient care in the management of CML, particularly early in response. Longerterm follow-up data will be required to confirm CCyR as a surrogate marker for survival in imatinib-resistant patients treated with the secondgeneration tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib.","['Mauro, Michael J']",['Mauro MJ'],"['Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Oregon Cancer Institute Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA. maurom@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['S1557-9190(11)70195-0 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2009.n.043 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2009 Jun;9(3):217-22. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2009.n.043.,10.3816/CLM.2009.n.043 [doi],,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well-known that astroglia produces a plethora of growth factors which might be protective for neurons. Growth factors prevent neurons from cell death and promote proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells. Previous data suggest that astrocytes may respond to toxic stimuli by a selective mobilization of guarding molecules. In the present study, we have investigated the potency of different pathological stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides, tumor necrosis factor alpha, glutamate, and hydrogen peroxide to activate cultured cortical astroglia and stimulate growth factor expression. Astroglial cultures were exposed to the above factors for 24h at non-toxic concentrations for astrocytes. Growth factor expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, oligo-microarray technique, and ELISA. Insulin-like growth factor-1 was selectively down-regulated by lipopolysaccharides and tumor necrosis factor alpha, bone morphogenetic protein 6 by all stimuli. In contrast, lipopolysaccharides, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and glutamate increased leukemia inhibitory factor. Fibroblast growth factor 2 was up-regulated by lipopolysaccharides and tumor necrosis factor alpha and down-regulated by hydrogen peroxide. Besides hydrogen peroxide, all other stimuli promoted vascular epithelial growth factor A mRNA and protein expression.

Improper expression and mutations in Runx1 are frequently implicated in human leukemia. Here, we report that CHIP, the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein, also named Stub1, physically interacts with Runx1 through the TPR and Charged domains in the nucleus. Over-expression of CHIP directly induced Runx1 ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interestingly, we found that CHIP-mediated degradation of Runx1 is independent of the molecular chaperone Hsp70/90. Taken together, we propose that CHIP serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates Runx1 protein stability via an ubiquitination and degradation mechanism that is independent of Hsp70/90.","['Shang, Yu', 'Zhao, Xinghui', 'Xu, Xialian', 'Xin, Hong', 'Li, Xueni', 'Zhai, Yonggong', 'He, Dacheng', 'Jia, Baoqing', 'Chen, Wei', 'Chang, Zhijie']","['Shang Y', 'Zhao X', 'Xu X', 'Xin H', 'Li X', 'Zhai Y', 'He D', 'Jia B', 'Chen W', 'Chang Z']","['School of Medicine, Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090612,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (STUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitination']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)01158-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.06.043 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Aug 14;386(1):242-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.06.043.

We have shown previously that ts1 infects glial cells in the brain, but not neurons. The most likely mechanism for ts1-mediated neurodegeneration is loss of glial redox support and glial cell toxicity to neurons. Minocycline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in various models of neurodegeneration. This study was designed to determine whether and how minocycline prevents paralysis and death in ts1-infected mice. We show here that minocycline delays neurodegeneration in ts1-infected mice, and that it prevents death of cultured astrocytes infected by ts1 through attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Although minocycline reduces virus titers in the CNS of infected mice, it does not affect virus titers in infected mice thymi, spleens or infected C1 astrocytes. In addition, minocycline prevents death of primary neurons when they are cocultured with ts1-infected astrocytes, through mechanisms involving both inhibition of oxidative stress and upregulation of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which controls cellular antioxidant defenses. We conclude that minocycline delays retrovirus ts1-induced neurodegeneration involving antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.","['Kuang, Xianghong', 'Scofield, Virginia L', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Stoica, George', 'Liu, Na', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Kuang X', 'Scofield VL', 'Yan M', 'Stoica G', 'Liu N', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, 1808 Park Road 1-C, PO Box 389, Smithville, TX 78957, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043984-07/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784-13/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH071583-19/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH071583/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043984/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090611,Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain Stem/drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gliosis/drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Minocycline/*pharmacology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nerve Degeneration/*drug therapy/virology', 'Neurons/drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/pathology', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(09)01170-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2009.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2009 Aug 25;1286:174-84. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.06.007.

Here, we identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a previously unrecognized component of the IFN response. IFN stimulated an association of PLZF with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to induce a decisive subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice had a specific ISG expression defect and as a result were more susceptible to viral infection.

Despite its high prevalence, there is limited information about allergenic shrimp proteins. OBJECTIVE: Characterization of shrimp allergens. METHODS: Fifty-two adults and children with a history of immediate allergic reactions to shrimp and elevated serum IgE to shrimp were selected for this study. Tryptic digests from a 20-kd IgE-binding protein were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, identifying the protein as a sarcoplasmic-calcium-binding protein. cDNA encoding sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) from a shrimp cDNA library (Litopenaeus vannamei) was amplified by PCR, cloned into an expression vector, and sequenced. Recombinant SCP was tested with patients' sera. ELISA inhibition experiments determined the fraction of total shrimp IgE recognizing SCP. A functional assay with a rat basophilic leukemia cell line was used to determine the capacity for mediator release induced by SCP. RESULTS: Immunoblotting demonstrated IgE binding by 31 of 52 (59.6%) of the sera to a 20-kd shrimp protein. The protein was identified as a SCP. Amplified cDNA encoding SCP was isolated and sequenced. Open reading frame translation provided the complete amino acid sequence of shrimp SCP. Recombinant SCP was recognized by serum IgE from 20 of 52 (38.4%) subjects, of whom 17 of 20 (85%) were children. ELISA inhibition of pooled sera IgE reactivity to BS extract using recombinant SCP was significant (as high as 79%).

It is responsible for the fatal demyelinating disease Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. JCV binds to cells using the serotonin receptor 5-HT(2A)R and alpha(2-6)- or alpha(2-3)-linked sialic acid. It enters cells using clathrin-dependent endocytosis and traffics to the early endosome and possibly to the endoplasmic reticulum. Viral DNA is then delivered to the nucleus where transcription, replication, and assembly of progeny occur. We found that the early regulatory protein large T antigen accumulates in microdomains in the nucleus adjacent to ND-10 or PML domains. This observation prompted us to explore the role of these domains in JCV infection. We found that a reduction of nuclear PML enhanced virus infection and that an increase in nuclear PML reduced infection. Infection with JCV did not directly modulate nuclear levels of PML but our data indicate that a host response involving interferon beta is likely to restrict virus infection by increasing nuclear PML.","['Gasparovic, Megan L', 'Maginnis, Melissa S', ""O'Hara, Bethany A"", 'Dugan, Aisling S', 'Atwood, Walter J']","['Gasparovic ML', 'Maginnis MS', ""O'Hara BA"", 'Dugan AS', 'Atwood WJ']","['Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA071878-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 NS053340-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS43097/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 NS053340/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA071878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1F31NS053340-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043097/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS043097-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090611,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*virology', 'Chromosomes/*virology', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/*growth & development', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(09)00303-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2009.05.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2009 Aug 1;390(2):279-88. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2009.05.017.

The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement is an evidence-based approach to improve the quality of RCTs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting quality of published RCTs concerning myeloid hematologic malignancies according to the CONSORT statement. METHODS: PubMed was searched for English-language RCTs involving patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Trials were considered eligible when participants were randomly assigned to at least two treatment arms and included patients with AML, CML or MDS. Quality of reporting was assessed using a 24-item questionnaire based on the CONSORT checklist. Reporting was assessed in one pre-CONSORT (1988-1995) and one post-CONSORT (1996-2008) period. The effect of CONSORT statement in high- and low-ranked journals, according to their impact factor, has also been evaluated. RESULTS: The search identified 261 eligible articles for analysis. Only 13 of the 24 items of CONSORT statement were addressed in 75% or more of the studies. Most items concerning the methodological issues were reported by fewer than 50% of the studies. Significant improvements over time were seen for items that assessed the methodological quality, while RCTs published in high-ranked journals showed better quality of reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of reporting in RCTs focusing on myeloid malignancies remains unsatisfactory. Further improvement of reporting is necessary to assess the validity of clinical research.","['Ziogas, Dimitrios C', 'Zintzaras, Elias']","['Ziogas DC', 'Zintzaras E']","['Department of Biomathematics, University of Thessaly School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Disclosure/*standards', '*Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Journal Impact Factor', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*standards', 'Review Literature as Topic']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1047-2797(09)00107-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2009 Jul;19(7):494-500. doi: 10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.018.,10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.018 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytosine arabinoside (AraC) is an anticancer drug commonly used in leukemia treatment. Its side effects include neuronal cell death in the cerebellum and severe motor coordination deficits. We have previously shown that AraC administration (400mg/kg bw) in adult rats reduced NF immunostaining in cerebellar neurons. To further delineate the susceptibility of individual NF isoforms (NF-H, NF-M, NF-L) to AraC, in the present study we used Western blot analysis to quantify their level. A significant and selective reduction of NF-H isoform was observed in the cerebellum of AraC-treated animals, compared to the controls. Administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for a period of 14 days (prior to and during AraC treatment), which was previously shown to ameliorate the AraC-induced motor deficits in these animals, largely prevented the reduction in NF-H isoform. Given the significant role of NF proteins and particularly NF-H in maintaining structural integrity and synaptic transport, the observed loss of this isoform may be a key-target of AraC action in cerebellar neurons. Moreover, this study provides further data on the neuroprophylactic role of NAC in vivo against chemotherapy-induced toxicity.","['Koros, Christos', 'Kitraki, Efthimia']","['Koros C', 'Kitraki E']","['Lab of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, Athens University, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090610,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cerebellum/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isomerism', 'Male', 'Neurofilament Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(09)00273-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2009 Sep 28;189(3):215-8. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.05.024.

However, its roles in the regulation of pancreatic cancer progression remain unclear. In this report, we investigated the suppressive effects of EG-VEGF on pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis and the relevant mechanisms. By using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we found that the Mia PaCa II cells of the pancreatic cancer cell line express the mRNAs of both EG-VEGF (Prok1) and its receptors. EG-VEGF protects pancreatic cancer cells from apoptosis through upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic protein of the bcl-2 family. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with EG-VEGF results in the rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), STAT3, and AKT, which are involved in the upregulation of Mcl-1 expression. EG-VEGF (Prok1) protects Mia PaCa II cells from apoptosis through G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-induced activation of multiple signal pathways, and hence can be a novel target for pancreatic cancer therapy.","['Ren, Li-Nan', 'Li, Qing-Fang', 'Xiao, Feng-Jun', 'Yan, Jun', 'Yang, Yue-Feng', 'Wang, Li-Sheng', 'Guo, Xiao-Zhong', 'Wang, Hua']","['Ren LN', 'Li QF', 'Xiao FJ', 'Yan J', 'Yang YF', 'Wang LS', 'Guo XZ', 'Wang H']","[""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Institute of Digestive Diseases, Xijing Hospital of Digestive Disease, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, PR China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090610,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Endocrine-Gland-Derived)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Endocrine-Gland-Derived/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)01080-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.149 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Aug 14;386(1):35-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.149.

ONC is now in Phase IIIb clinical trials for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma. Internalization of ONC to the cytosol of cancer cells is essential for its cytotoxic activity, despite the apparent absence of a cell-surface receptor protein. Endocytosis and cytotoxicity do, however, appear to correlate with the net positive charge of ribonucleases. To dissect the contribution made by the endogenous arginine and lysine residues of ONC to its cytotoxicity, 22 variants were created in which cationic residues were replaced with alanine. Variants with the same net charge (+2 to +5) as well as equivalent catalytic activity and conformational stability were found to exhibit large (> 10-fold) differences in toxicity for the cells of a human leukemia line. In addition, a more cationic ONC variant could be either much more or much less cytotoxic than a less cationic variant, again depending on the distribution of its cationic residues. The endocytosis of variants with widely divergent cytotoxic activity was quantified by flow cytometry using a small-molecule fluorogenic label, and was found to vary by twofold or less. This small difference in endocytosis did not account for the large difference in cytotoxicity, implicating the distribution of cationic residues as being critical for lipid-bilayer translocation subsequent to endocytosis. This finding has fundamental implications for understanding the interaction of ribonucleases and other proteins with mammalian cells.","['Turcotte, Rebecca F', 'Lavis, Luke D', 'Raines, Ronald T']","['Turcotte RF', 'Lavis LD', 'Raines RT']","['Medical Scientist Training Program and Biophysics Graduate Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['S10 RR013790/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073808-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA073808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '08349/PHS HHS/United States', 'RR13790/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008692/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090611,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cations)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cations', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rana pipiens/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7098 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07098.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Jul;276(14):3846-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07098.x.

Their molecular pathogenesis has been associated with recurrent acquired mutations in janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL). These discoveries have simplified the diagnostic approach and provided a number of clues to understanding the phenotypic expression of MPNs; furthermore, they represented a framework for developing and/or testing in clinical trials small molecules acting as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. On the other hand, evidence of abnormal epigenetic gene regulation as a mechanism potentially contributing to the pathogenesis and the phenotypic diversity of MPNs is still scanty; however, study of epigenetics in MPNs represents an active field of research. The first clinical trials with epigenetic drugs have been completed recently, whereas others are still ongoing; results have been variable and at present do not allow any firm conclusion. Novel basic and translational information concerning epigenetic gene regulation in MPNs and the perspectives for therapy will be critically addressed in this review.","['Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Bogani, Costanza', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Rambaldi A', 'Bogani C', 'Barbui T']","['UF di Ematologia, Dip.

In several of these patients, increased serum tryptase levels are detectable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have determined serum tryptase levels in 914 patients with haematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative disorders (n = 156), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, n = 241), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 317), systemic mastocytosis (SM, n = 81), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 59) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 26). Moreover, tryptase was measured in 136 patients with non-neoplastic haematological disorders, 102 with non-haematological disorders and 164 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, the median serum tryptase was 5.2 ng mL(-1). Elevated serum tryptase levels were found to cluster in myeloid neoplasm, whereas almost all patients with lymphoid neoplasms exhibited normal tryptase. Among myeloid neoplasms, elevated tryptase levels (> 15 ng mL(-1)) were recorded in > 90% of patients with SM, 38% with AML, 34% with CML and 25% with MDS. The highest tryptase levels, often > 1000 ng mL(-1), were found in advanced SM and core-binding-factor leukaemias. In most patients with non-neoplastic haematological disorders and non-haematological disorders analysed in our study, tryptase levels were normal, the exception being a few patients with end-stage kidney disease and helminth infections, in whom a slightly elevated tryptase was found. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, tryptase is a new diagnostic marker of myeloid neoplasms and a useful test in clinical haematology.","['Sperr, W R', 'El-Samahi, A', 'Kundi, M', 'Girschikofsky, M', 'Winkler, S', 'Lutz, D', 'Endler, G', 'Rumpold, H', 'Agis, H', 'Sillaber, C', 'Jager, U', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'El-Samahi A', 'Kundi M', 'Girschikofsky M', 'Winkler S', 'Lutz D', 'Endler G', 'Rumpold H', 'Agis H', 'Sillaber C', 'Jager U', 'Valent P']","['Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090612,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tryptases/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/16 09:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2184 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02184.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2009 Oct;39(10):914-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02184.x.

We analysed serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow samples obtained from 27 patients displaying the following dysfunctions: lymphoma, trombocytopenia, haemophilia, pancytopenia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presence of HCV-RNA in samples was detected by RT-PCR. All the serum samples were HCV-RNA positive as well as 9 out of 27 (33%) PBMC and 17 out of 27 (63%) of bone marrow samples. Independently to the disorder type, the co-presence of HCV-RNA in serum and bone marrow with the simultaneous absence of the viral genetic material in PBMC was detected in 5 (18.5%) of patients. This result suggests that bone marrow is a site of active viral replication. To check whether a viral replication generates any mutations, an SSCP analysis of the 5'UTR viral region was performed. The difference in the viral sequence derived from serum, PBMC and bone marrow was detected in one case. This result may indicate the occurrence of mutation process during the viral replication in bone marrow. An immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow smears showed the presence of HCV antigens. CONCLUSION: bone marrow cells of patients displaying hematological disorders represent a putative site of extrahepatic HCV replication.","['Pawelczyk, Agnieszka', 'Polanska, Marta', 'Kisiel, Elzbieta', 'Chmielewski, Marcin', 'Bukowska, Iwona', 'Fic, Maria', 'Radkowski, Marek']","['Pawelczyk A', 'Polanska M', 'Kisiel E', 'Chmielewski M', 'Bukowska I', 'Fic M', 'Radkowski M']",['Zaklad Immunopatologii Chorob Zakaznych i Pasozytniczych Warszawski Uniwersytet Medyczny. agnieszka.pawelczyk@wum.edu.pl'],['pol'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Przegl Epidemiol,Przeglad epidemiologiczny,0413725,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*virology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/virology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*virology', 'Hemophilia A/virology', 'Hepacivirus/*physiology', 'Hepatitis C/complications/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Lymphoma/virology', 'Male', 'Pancytopenia/virology', 'Poland', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', '*Virus Replication']",2009/06/16 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/06/16 09:00'],"['2009/06/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Przegl Epidemiol. 2009;63(1):29-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,Replikacja wirusa zapalenia watroby typu C (HCV) w szpiku kostnym pacjentow z zaburzeniami hematologicznymi.,,,,,,,,,

Based on the MEKC coupled with LIF detection, a quantitative approach was developed for the determination of Rho123 delivered into K562 cells by o-SWNTs. Where the adsorbed Rho123 on o-SWNTs could be desorbed by SDS in running buffer and be simultaneously separated with o-SWNTs due to the differences of their electrophoretic mobility by applying the electric potential at the both ends of capillary. Using this approach, the intracellular uptakes of Rho123 in multidrug-resistant and multidrug-sensitive leukemia cells were quantified, and the results showed that o-SWNTs could be used as the potential drug carriers to deliver small molecules into cells via the physical adsorption along with the circumventing of multidrug resistance of leukemia cells.","['Li, Ruibin', ""Wu, Ren'an"", 'Wu, Minghuo', 'Zou, Hanfa', 'Ma, Hong', 'Yang, Ling', 'Le, X Chris']","['Li R', 'Wu R', 'Wu M', 'Zou H', 'Ma H', 'Yang L', 'Le XC']","['National Chromatographic R&A Center, Key Laboratory of Separation Sciences for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, P.

However, the transcriptional regulation of NANOG itself in hESCs has largely been elusive. We established a NANOG promoter luciferase reporter assay as a fast read-out for indicating the pluripotent status of hESCs. From the functional cDNA screens and NANOG promoter characterization, we successfully identified a zinc finger transcription factor KLF4 and a homeodomain transcription factor PBX1 as two novel transcriptional regulators that maintain the pluripotent and undifferentiated state of hESCs. We showed that both KLF4 and PBX1 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated during hESC differentiation. In addition, overexpression of KLF4 and PBX1 upregulated NANOG promoter activity and also the endogenous NANOG protein expression in hESCs. Direct binding of KLF4 on NANOG proximal promoter and PBX1 on a new upstream enhancer and proximal promoter were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Knockdown of KLF4/PBX1 or mutation of KLF4/PBX1 binding motifs significantly downregulated NANOG promoter activity. We also showed that specific members of the SP/KLF and PBX family are functionally redundant at the NANOG promoter and that KLF4 and PBX1 cooperated with OCT4 and SOX2, and transactivated synergistically the NANOG promoter activity. Our results show two novel upstream transcription activators of NANOG that are functionally important for the self-renewal of hESC and provide new insights into the expanded regulatory circuitry that maintains hESC pluripotency.","['Chan, Ken Kwok-Keung', 'Zhang, Jingyao', 'Chia, Na-Yu', 'Chan, Yun-Shen', 'Sim, Hui Shan', 'Tan, Ker Sin', 'Oh, Steve Kah-Weng', 'Ng, Huck-Hui', 'Choo, Andre Boon-Hwa']","['Chan KK', 'Zhang J', 'Chia NY', 'Chan YS', 'Sim HS', 'Tan KS', 'Oh SK', 'Ng HH', 'Choo AB']","['Stem Cell Group, Bioprocessing Technology Institute, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Biopolis, Singapore. ken_chan@bti.a-star.edu.sg']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/06/13 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.143 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Sep;27(9):2114-25. doi: 10.1002/stem.143.,10.1002/stem.143 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stability, fluorescent properties as well as cytostatic effect and cellular uptake of these compounds were studied. Dau-conjugates with squaric amide or oxime linkage were stable, but continuous release of free Dau was observed from the hydrazone conjugate in solution. We found that some spectral characteristics (e.g., the amplitude of the emission spectrum) of conjugates could be sensitive for the site of coupling (amino vs. oxo function). Cytostasis and cellular uptake of conjugates were investigated both on human leukemia (HL-60) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines by MTT assay and flow cytometry We found that cytostatic effect and uptake properties of Dau-conjugates were dependent on the acid stability of the linkage (hydrazone vs. oxime/amide) applied and more markedly on the cell line studied.","['Miklan, Zsanett', 'Orban, Erika', 'Csik, Gabriella', 'Schlosser, Gitta', 'Magyar, Anna', 'Hudecz, Ferenc']","['Miklan Z', 'Orban E', 'Csik G', 'Schlosser G', 'Magyar A', 'Hudecz F']","['Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Peptides)', '25212-18-4 (polyarginine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy', 'Daunorubicin/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Peptides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2009/06/13 09:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bip.21264 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2009;92(6):489-501. doi: 10.1002/bip.21264.,10.1002/bip.21264 [doi],,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the Type I and Type II error rates conditional on the mix of enrolled patients may differ considerably from the unconditional error rates used to design the trial. We describe a method for designing two-stage Phase II studies that accounts for patient heterogeneity and effectively stabilizes conditional Type I and Type II error over the range of patient mixes that are likely to arise.

Recent evidence indicates that PML plays a tumour-suppressive role in cancer of multiple histological origins. However, it is only very recently that PML growth-suppressive functions have been implicated in regulating physiological processes and tissue homoeostasis. In particular, it has been shown that PML is one of the key cell-cycle regulators controlling stem cell function in multiple tissues, from the blood to the brain. As a consequence, PML loss has an impact on tissue development and maintenance of stem cell pools. In addition, new data suggest that PML regulates self-renewal in cancer stem cells. Finally, the oncogenic fusion protein PML/RARalpha, contrary to the conventional view, appears to hijack growth-suppressive pathways to promote transformation of haematopoietic stem cells and to maintain the APL stem cell niche. Overall, these findings not only represent a change in paradigm in the field of PML/APL research, but also contribute to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying stem cell function in vivo. The main objective of this review is to critically discuss the very recent literature on the role of PML in stem cells and tumour-initiating cells. Ultimately, it aims to propose new avenues of investigation.","['Salomoni, P']",['Salomoni P'],"['MRC Toxicology Unit, Leicester, UK. ps90@le.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090612,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/cytology', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Human/cytology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/06/13 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd200963 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Aug;16(8):1083-92. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.63.

Purine analogs, bendamustine, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory drugs have shown higher response rates than previously achieved with standard CLL treatments such as alkylating agents. However, a consequence is that increased rates of tumor-cell killing may be accompanied by adverse secondary effects. One well-known consequence of rapid and massive cell killing is a group of metabolic disruptions collectively known as tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS can be life threatening or fatal when unrecognized and/or untreated, and may cause delays in treatment of the underlying disease. It is important to be aware of patient risk factors, prophylactic measures, diagnostic criteria, and treatment for TLS. This review discusses the relevance of TLS to CLL treatment and provides guidelines for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of TLS in patients being treated for CLL.","['Cheson, Bruce D']",['Cheson BD'],"['Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA. bdc4@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology/*prevention & control']",2009/06/13 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2009 Apr;7(4):263-71.,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher Bcl-2 expression correlates to an adverse outcome following therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current study determined whether a BCL2 gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) could affect treatment outcomes in 99 AML patients excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia. Two genotypes were tested, including BCL2 -938 C>A (rs2279115) and +21 A>G (rs1801018). Neither the -938 C>A nor the +21 A>G BLC2 genotype was associated with complete remission (CR) rates following chemotherapy. The -938 A>C BCL2 genotype did not affect leukemia-free survival (LFS), event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS). However, of interest, the BCL2 +21 A>G genotype correlated with LFS, EFS and OS: The group with the +21 AA genotype had a significantly longer median LFS (p<0.001) or EFS (p=0.004), and OS (p=0.04). The multivariate analyses confirmed that this BCL2 gene SNP is an independent prognostic factor for LFS (p=0.05, HR 1.83, 95% C.I.

Recently, a structurally related peptide, neuromedin S (NMS), which shares an amidated C-terminal heptapeptide motif, has been identified in both rat and human, and has been proposed as a second ligand for these receptors. Messenger RNA encoding NMU receptor subtypes shows differential expression: NMU(1) is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, whereas NMU(2) is abundant within the brain and spinal cord. NMU peptide parallels receptor distribution with highest expression in the gastrointestinal tract and specific structures within the brain, reflecting its major role in the regulation of energy balance. The NMU knockout mouse has an obese phenotype and, in agreement, the Arg165Trp amino acid variant of NMU-25 in humans, which is functionally inactive, co-segregated with childhood-onset obesity. Emerging physiological roles for NMU include vasoconstriction mediated predominantly via NMU(1) with nociception and bone remodelling via NMU(2). The NMU system has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock and cancers including bladder carcinoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. Intriguingly, NMS is more potent at NMU(2) receptors in vivo where it has similar central actions in suppression of feeding and regulation of circadian rhythms to NMU. Taken together with its vascular actions, NMU may be a functional link between energy balance and the cardiovascular system and may provide a future target for therapies directed against the disorders that comprise metabolic syndrome.","['Mitchell, J D', 'Maguire, J J', 'Davenport, A P']","['Mitchell JD', 'Maguire JJ', 'Davenport AP']","['Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University of Cambridge, Level 6 Centre for Clinical Investigation, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['FS/05/020/18408/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'PG/05/127/19872/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'PS/02/001/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090610,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (neuromedin S)', '117505-80-3 (neuromedin U)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Metabolic Syndrome/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle, Smooth/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Neuropeptides/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Vasoconstriction/drug effects/physiology']",2009/06/13 09:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['BPH252 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00252.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Sep;158(1):87-103. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00252.x.

The two major mechanisms regulating apoptosis include the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway induced by death signalling ligands. In a previous study, we showed activation of apoptosis-regulating proteins BAX and BCL-2 in road pavers chronically exposed to bitumen fumes. These molecules play a central role in activation of programmed cell death by the intrinsic pathway. In this study, we hypothesized that the apoptosis mechanism could be activated in the skin of road pavers chronically exposed to bitumen fumes also through the extrinsic pathway, via mediation by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its death receptor, DR5. METHODS: Skin punch biopsies from 16 occupationally exposed workers and a control group were processed immunohistochemically for TRAIL and DR5. Activation of programmed cell death was also investigated by expression of caspase-3 and visualization of DNA strand breaks. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: TRAIL, DR5 and caspase-3 overexpression and enhanced Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) positivity were found in chronically bitumen-exposed skin, suggesting activation of apoptosis as a defence mechanism.","['Rapisarda, Venerando', 'Carnazza, Maria L', 'Caltabiano, Candida', 'Loreto, Carla', 'Musumeci, Giuseppe', 'Valentino, Matteo', 'Martinez, Giuseppa']","['Rapisarda V', 'Carnazza ML', 'Caltabiano C', 'Loreto C', 'Musumeci G', 'Valentino M', 'Martinez G']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '8052-42-4 (asphalt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biopsy', 'Caspase 3/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin/*metabolism/*pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']",2009/06/13 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']","['CUP1140 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0560.2008.01140.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2009 Jul;36(7):781-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2008.01140.x.,10.1111/j.1600-0560.2008.01140.x [doi],,,,,,,,['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare primary cutaneous epithelial neoplasm most commonly found in sun-exposed sites in elderly male Caucasians. A 66-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of a purple painless 2 cm tumor on the scalp. Excision biopsy revealed an incompletely excised MCC, and at the periphery of the MCC, a lymphocytic infiltrate interpreted as reactive. A re-excision biopsy showed residual MCC as well as dense aggregates of small lymphocytes within and surrounding the MCC. Immunohistochemistry showed characteristic dot-like cytoplasmic positivity for cytokeratin 20 in the MCC; the lymphocytic infiltrate was positive for CD5, CD20 and CD23, diagnostic of CLL. Subsequent staging revealed widespread lymphadenopathy, and lymph node biopsy showed CLL.

These biological response modifiers exert their pleiotropic effects through the interaction with nuclear receptors, defined as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These ligand-activated nuclear receptors induce the transcription of target genes by binding to responsive elements in the promoter regions. RARs and RXRs are also capable to interact with other nuclear receptors, thus expanding their spectrum of action on gene expression. Evidence has been accumulated indicating that retinoids may exert beneficial effects in both immune-mediated disorders and tumors. With regard to cancer, retinoids directly target neoplastic cells by inducing differentiation, inhibiting cell growth or promoting survival. However, the efficacy of these compounds in cancer treatment probably resides in their ability to modulate also the function of immune effectors. Vitamin A derivatives are currently used in the therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia and of cutaneous T cell lymphomas, but they could be effective also on B-cell malignancies. Clinical trials are ongoing to test their efficacy in solid tumors. In this review, we give a broad depiction of how retinoids influence the function of immune effectors and affect growth and survival of hematological malignancies.

It is now clear that immune effector cells are capable of recognizing and destroying some cancer cells. However, tumors have developed numerous mechanisms by which they avoid immune recognition and death. Cancer immunotherapy attempts to harness the power of the immune system and direct it against tumor growth, while circumventing the immune-evasion strategies utilized by tumors. Many approaches are currently being investigated, including the re-infusion of autologous immune effector cells (i.e. cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages) back into hosts after ex vivo expansion and activation. The therapeutic effects of specific cytokines are also being evaluated for their impact on tumor growth. Our lab has discovered a novel thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) binding protein, termed ""angiocidin"", with potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic capabilities. To further investigate the anti-tumor activity of angiocidin, we examined whether angiocidin could play a role in immune system modulation. We have found that the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, as well as freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes, differentiate into macrophage-like cells when treated with angiocidin. These cells underwent dramatic morphological changes and became more phagocytic. Angiocidin-treated monocytes also activated T lymphocytes in co-culture conditions. Angiocidin-treated THP-1 cells upregulated cytokine mRNA expression and secretion via NF-kappaB, MAPK, and PI3-K. Based on these data, we hypothesize that angiocidin's ability to elicit tumor cell death may be mediated in part by it's pro-inflammatory effects on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.","['Gaurnier-Hausser, A', 'Tuszynski, G P']","['Gaurnier-Hausser A', 'Tuszynski GP']","['Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA 88931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (PSMD4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology']",2009/06/13 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/138161209788453149 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2009;15(17):1937-48. doi: 10.2174/138161209788453149.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the partial lack of response in these p53 wild-type B-CLL samples was not due to defects in the ability of Nutlin-3 to promote p53 induction, as confirmed by the rapid accumulation of p53 protein at Western blot analysis in response to Nutlin-3 in all samples examined.

In this article, we review current practice and recent advances made in prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease.","['Khaled, Yasser', 'Reddy, Pavan', 'Krijanovski, Oleg']","['Khaled Y', 'Reddy P', 'Krijanovski O']","['The University of Michigan, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, SPC 5942, 6310 Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0942, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,"['0 (Drugs, Investigational)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drugs, Investigational/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/classification/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Salvage Therapy/trends', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects']",2009/06/13 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/06/13 09:00'],"['2009/06/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728210903018891 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2009 Jun;14(2):219-32. doi: 10.1517/14728210903018891.,10.1517/14728210903018891 [doi],,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were analyzed from 130 patients with CP CML who were treated with dasatinib from November 2003 to March 2006 in phase 1 (n = 22) or phase 2 or 3 (n = 108) studies for the development of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria [version 3.0]). RESULTS: Grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 94 (72%) patients during dasatinib therapy and grade 3 to 4 occurred in 67 (52%) patients. Of the 94 patients who developed grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, 64 (68%) also developed at least grade 2 anemia, and 16 (17%) developed grade 3 to 4 anemia. Management of cytopenias included transient dasatinib interruption in 35 (37%) patients, filgrastim in 12 (14%) patients, recombinant erythropoietin in 29 (45%) patients, and interleukin-11 in 3 (5%) patients. Factors associated with an increased risk for developing grade 2 to 4 cytopenias were longer time from diagnosis to treatment, prior interferon or imatinib therapy, and a lower white blood cell count at the initiation of dasatinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic toxicity was frequent during dasatinib therapy in patients with CP CML, particularly at doses >100 mg daily. Treatment interruption and/or dose reduction as well as growth factor support were found to be safe and efficacious strategies to facilitate the continuous administration of dasatinib.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'De Souza Santos, Fabio Pires', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Awais, Ahmed', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'De Souza Santos FP', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Awais A', 'Borthakur G', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The significance of this response was not well defined. METHODS: The significance of having had a suboptimal response during imatinib therapy among 281 patients with CML treated with standard-dose (n = 73) or high-dose (n = 208) imatinib was investigated. RESULTS: Rates of suboptimal response at 6, 12, and 18 months were 4%, 8%, and 40%, respectively, and were not influenced by Sokal risk score. Patients with a suboptimal response at 6 months had a significantly lower probability of eventually achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) compared with those with an optimal response (30% vs 97%; P < .001), and their event-free survival (EFS) and transformation-free survival (TFS) were found to be similar to those with criteria for failure at this time point. Suboptimal response at 12 months defined a group with a similar TFS as those with optimal response, but with worse EFS. In contrast, patients with a suboptimal response at 18 months had outcomes that were similar to those patients with an optimal response. A multivariate analysis confirmed the significance of response category after adjusting for pretreatment characteristics and imatinib dose. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggested that suboptimal response was a heterogeneous category, and some patients had an outcome that mirrored that of patients with failed therapy. Interventions aimed at improving this outcome are required.","['Alvarado, Yesid', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Burger, Jan', 'Wierda, William', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Alvarado Y', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Borthakur G', 'Burger J', 'Wierda W', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Shan J', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 15 children with neurologic complications of leukemia or its treatment were reviewed retrospectively. The first group consisted of patients with CNS abnormalities detected prior to or during treatment, or within three months after completion of treatment. Patients with CNS complications detected by MRI three months following completion of treatment were included in the second group. RESULTS: Among the 15 children, six had two or more different CNS abnormalities. The imaging abnormalities seen in 12 patients prior to or during treatment, or within three months after completion of treatment included orbital, temporal, cerebellopontine angle, and spinal chloroma; bilateral subdural hematoma in the subacute stage; multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage; bilateral retinal hemorrhage and detachment; hematoma in the pons and mesencephalon; PRES (posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome); bilateral leukemic infiltration of the 3(rd), left 7(th), and 8(th) cranial nerves; and meningeal leukemia. Three months after completion of treatment, three patients had CNS complications including radiation necrosis and secondary brain tumor, osteomyelitis of the L3 vertebra, and meningeal leukemia.

However, this labeling technique requires long (>12-16 hours) incubation time and uses relatively high dose of Pro (5-6 microg/ml) that makes large extracellular FePro complexes. These complexes can be difficult to clean with simple cell washes and may create low signal intensity on T2* weighted MRI that is not desirable. The purpose of this study was to revise the current labeling method by using low dose of Pro and adding Fe and Pro directly to the cells before generating any FePro complexes. Human tumor glioma (U251) and human monocytic leukemia cell (THP-1) lines were used as model systems for attached and suspension cell types, respectively and dose dependent (Fe 25 to 100 microg/ml and Pro 0.75 to 3 microg/ml) and time dependent (2 to 48 h) labeling experiments were performed. Labeling efficiency and cell viability of these cells were assessed. Prussian blue staining revealed that more than 95% of cells were labeled. Intracellular iron concentration in U251 cells reached approximately 30-35 pg-iron/cell at 24 h when labeled with 100 microg/ml of Fe and 3 microg/ml of Pro. However, comparable labeling was observed after 4 h across the described FePro concentrations. Similarly, THP-1 cells achieved approximately 10 pg-iron/cell at 48 h when labeled with 100 microg/ml of Fe and 3 microg/ml of Pro. Again, comparable labeling was observed after 4 h for the described FePro concentrations. FePro labeling did not significantly affect cell viability. There was almost no extracellular FePro complexes observed after simple cell washes. To validate and to determine the effectiveness of the revised technique, human T-cells, human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSC), human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSC) and mouse neuronal stem cells (mNSC C17.2) were labeled. Labeling for 4 hours using 100 microg/ml of Fe and 3 microg/ml of Pro resulted in very efficient labeling of these cells, without impairing their viability and functional capability. The new technique with short incubation time using 100 microg/ml of Fe and 3 microg/ml of Pro is effective in labeling cells for cellular MRI.","['Janic, Branislava', 'Rad, Ali M', 'Jordan, Elaine K', 'Iskander, A S M', 'Ali, Md M', 'Varma, N Ravi S', 'Frank, Joseph A', 'Arbab, Ali S']","['Janic B', 'Rad AM', 'Jordan EK', 'Iskander AS', 'Ali MM', 'Varma NR', 'Frank JA', 'Arbab AS']","['Cellular and Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA. bjanic@rad.hfh.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA 122031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA129801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS058589/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS 058589/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA 129801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090611,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protamines)', 'G6N3J05W84 (ferumoxides)', 'XM0M87F357 (Ferrosoferric Oxide)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Contrast Media/pharmacology', 'Dextrans', 'Ferrosoferric Oxide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Glioma/*therapy', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron/*instrumentation/methods', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Peptides', 'Protamines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2009/06/12 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/06/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005873 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Jun 11;4(6):e5873. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005873.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005873 [doi],PMC2690694,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When combined with optical trapping we may interrogate an isolated cell reducing extraneous signals from the local environment. To date, experimental configurations have employed combinations of the single beam optical tweezers trap and Raman spectroscopy, using either the same beam or separate beams for Raman interrogation and trapping. A key problem in optical tweezers is the ability to hold and manoeuvre large cells. In this paper, we use a dual beam fibre trap to hold and manoeuvre cells combined with an orthogonally placed objective to record Raman spectra. The dual beam trap, due to its divergent light fields, offers an as yet unexploited ability to hold and move large cellular objects with reduced prospects of photodamage. We additionally show how this system permits us to move large primary human keratinocytes (approximately 30 microns in diameter), such that we may record Raman spectra from local parts of a trapped cell with ease. Finally, we develop a rudimentary microfluidic system used to generate a flow of cells. Using our dual beam trap, combined with this flow system, we hold and acquire Raman spectra from individual cells chosen from a sample of HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells.","['Jess, P R T', 'Garces-Chavez, V', 'Smith, D', 'Mazilu, M', 'Paterson, L', 'Riches, A', 'Herrington, C S', 'Sibbett, W', 'Dholakia, K']","['Jess PR', 'Garces-Chavez V', 'Smith D', 'Mazilu M', 'Paterson L', 'Riches A', 'Herrington CS', 'Sibbett W', 'Dholakia K']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Opt Express,Optics express,101137103,,,,2006/06/12 00:00,2006/06/12 00:01,['2009/06/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2006/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/12 00:01 [medline]']","['90340 [pii]', '10.1364/oe.14.005779 [doi]']",ppublish,Opt Express. 2006 Jun 12;14(12):5779-91. doi: 10.1364/oe.14.005779.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of NPM1 gene leading to aberrant cytoplasmic dislocation of nucleophosmin (NPMc+) occurs in about one third of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients that exhibit distinctive biological and clinical features. We discuss the latest advances in the molecular basis of nucleophosmin traffic under physiological conditions, describe the molecular abnormalities underlying altered transport of nucleophosmin in NPM1-mutated AML and present evidences supporting the view that cytoplasmic nucleophosmin is a critical event for leukaemogenesis. We then outline how a highly specific immunohistochemical assay can be exploited to diagnose NPM1-mutated AML and myeloid sarcoma in paraffin-embedded samples by looking at aberrant nucleophosmin accumulation in cytoplasm of leukaemic cells. This procedure is also suitable for detection of haemopoietic multilineage involvement in bone marrow trephines. Moreover, use of immunohistochemistry as surrogate for molecular analysis can serve as first-line screening in AML and should facilitate implementation of the 2008 World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms that now incorporates AML with mutated NPM1 (synonym: NPMc+ AML) as a new provisional entity.

These cancers have worse prognoses than their B-cell counterparts, and their treatments carry significant morbidity. Although many pediatric malignancies have characteristic translocations, most T-lymphocyte-derived diseases lack cytogenetic hallmarks. Lacking these informative lesions, insight into their molecular pathogenesis is less complete. Although dysregulation of the NOTCH1 pathway occurs in a substantial fraction of cases, many other genetic lesions of T-cell malignancy have not yet been determined. To address this deficiency, we pioneered a phenotype-driven forward-genetic screen in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using transgenic fish with T-lymphocyte-specific expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we performed chemical mutagenesis, screened animals for GFP(+) tumors, and identified multiple lines with a heritable predisposition to T-cell malignancy. In each line, the patterns of infiltration and morphological appearance resembled human T-ALL and T-LBL. T-cell receptor analyses confirmed their clonality. Malignancies were transplantable and contained leukemia-initiating cells, like their human correlates. In summary, we have identified multiple zebrafish mutants that recapitulate human T-cell neoplasia and show heritable transmission. These vertebrate models provide new genetic platforms for the study of these important human cancers.","['Frazer, J K', 'Meeker, N D', 'Rudner, L', 'Bradley, D F', 'Smith, A C H', 'Demarest, B', 'Joshi, D', 'Locke, E E', 'Hutchinson, S A', 'Tripp, S', 'Perkins, S L', 'Trede, N S']","['Frazer JK', 'Meeker ND', 'Rudner L', 'Bradley DF', 'Smith AC', 'Demarest B', 'Joshi D', 'Locke EE', 'Hutchinson SA', 'Tripp S', 'Perkins SL', 'Trede NS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. kimble.frazer@hsc.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['K08 HD053350-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-HD53350/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD060310/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD060310-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-DK007115/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007115/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HD053350/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HD053350-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-AI079784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD001410/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K12-HD001410/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090611,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transgenes/*genetics', 'Zebrafish/*genetics']",2009/06/12 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/06/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009116 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1825-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.116.

Through a series of studies in 19 nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis), the potential therapeutic advantage of anti-CD45 PRIT was evaluated. Anti-CD45 PRIT demonstrated a significant improvement in target-to-normal organ ratios of absorbed radiation compared with directly radiolabeled bivalent antibody (conventional radioimmunotherapy [RIT]). Radio-DOTA-biotin administered 48 hours after anti-CD45 streptavidin fusion protein (FP) [BC8 (scFv)(4)SA] produced markedly lower concentrations of radiation in nontarget tissues compared with conventional RIT. PRIT generated superior target:normal organ ratios in the blood, lung, and liver (10.3:1, 18.9:1, and 9.9:1, respectively) compared with the conventional RIT controls (2.6:1, 6.4:1, and 2.9:1, respectively). The FP demonstrated superior retention in target tissues relative to comparable directly radiolabeled bivalent anti-CD45 RIT.

PAS (5-20 microM) initiated apoptosis within 24 hours, with maximal death at 48 hours asassessed by morphology, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase 3 activation, and annexin V staining. PAS treatment induced Bax proapoptotic conformational change, Bax movement from the cytosol to the mitochondria, and cytochrome c release, indicating that PAS induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. PAS induced approximately 3-fold up-regulation of proapoptotic Noxa protein and mRNA levels. In addition, Noxa was found unexpectedly to be bound to Bcl-2 in PAS-treated cells. PAS treatment of CLL cells failed to up-regulate p53, suggesting that PAS induced apoptosis independently of p53. Furthermore, PAS induced apoptosis in CLL isolates with p53 gene deletion in more than 97% of cells. Normal B lymphocytes were as sensitive to PAS-induced Noxa up-regulation and apoptosis as were CLL cells. However, both T lymphocytes and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells were relatively resistant to PAS. Our data suggest that PAS may represent a novel class of drug that induces apoptosis in CLL cells independently of p53 status by a mechanism involving Noxa up-regulation.","['Steele, Andrew J', 'Prentice, Archibald G', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Yogashangary, Birunthini C', 'Hart, Stephen M', 'Lowdell, Mark W', 'Samuel, Edward R', 'North, Janet M', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P', 'Chanalaris, Anastasios', 'Kottaridis, Panagiotis', 'Cwynarski, Kate', 'Wickremasinghe, R Gitendra']","['Steele AJ', 'Prentice AG', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Yogashangary BC', 'Hart SM', 'Lowdell MW', 'Samuel ER', 'North JM', 'Nacheva EP', 'Chanalaris A', 'Kottaridis P', 'Cwynarski K', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Institute, University College London Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090610,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/06/12 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37455-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-190587 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 6;114(6):1217-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-190587.

In immunocompromised patients, the endogenous intestinal gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens often cause infectious complications. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of chemotherapy treatment and antimicrobial prophylaxis on intestinal bacterial populations (microbiota) among pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are prone to intestinal mucositis and infections. METHODS: During 36 chemotherapy cycles, fecal samples were collected from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Fecal bacterial populations were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis with specific bacterial oligonucleotide probes was used to quantify the fecal bacteria. RESULTS: During chemotherapy treatment, the total number of bacteria in fecal samples was 10(9) per gram of dry weight feces, which was 100-fold lower than than in healthy control samples. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed that this decrease was the result of an up to 10,000-fold decrease in anaerobic bacteria, partly compensated for by a 100-fold increase in potentially pathogenic enterococci. Additional experiments showed that both prophylactic and therapeutic use of antibiotics could not sufficiently explain the tremendous changes in intestinal microbial composition. In vitro tests showed a direct bacteriostatic effect of chemotherapeutics. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with chemotherapy and prophylactic antibiotics are unable to maintain colonization resistance because of a decrease in anaerobic bacteria and an increase in potentially pathogenic aerobic enterococci. We hypothesize that this disturbance in the balance between anaerobic and aerobic bacteria will further increase the risk of gram-positive aerobic infections among immunocompromised patients with cancer.","['van Vliet, Michel J', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Dun, Catharina A J', 'Meessen, Nico E L', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Harmsen, Hermie J M']","['van Vliet MJ', 'Tissing WJ', 'Dun CA', 'Meessen NE', 'Kamps WA', 'de Bont ES', 'Harmsen HJ']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteria/classification/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Biodiversity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation']",2009/06/12 09:00,2009/08/04 09:00,['2009/06/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/04 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1086/599346 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 15;49(2):262-70. doi: 10.1086/599346.,10.1086/599346 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hard to predict helical cytokines in invertebrates based on sequences from mammals and vertebrates, because of their long evolutionary divergence. In this article, we collected 12 kinds of fish cytokines and constructed their respective consensus sequences using hidden Markov models; then, the conserved domains region of each consensus sequence were further extracted by the SMART tool, and used as the query sequence for PSI-BLAST analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. After two filtering processes based on the properties of helical cytokines, we obtained one protein named CG14629, which shares 25% identities/46% positives to fish M17 cytokine in the half length of the N-terminus. Considering the homology between M17 and LIF/CNTF (leukemia inhibitory factor/ciliary neurotrophic factor), and the close relationship between Dome, the putative cytokine receptor in Drosophila cells, and LIFR/CNTFR (LIF receptor/CNTF receptor), the results suggest that CG14629 is a good candidate for the helical cytokine ortholog in D. melanogaster.","['Cheng, Gong', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Li, Zuofeng', 'Liu, Xinyi', 'Yan, Weiyao', 'Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Zhong, Yang', 'Zheng, Zhaoxin']","['Cheng G', 'Zhao X', 'Li Z', 'Liu X', 'Yan W', 'Zhang X', 'Zhong Y', 'Zheng Z']","[""School of Life Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (dome protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/chemistry/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus Sequence/genetics/immunology', 'Cytokines/chemistry/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fish Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Fishes', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/chemistry/genetics', '*Sequence Alignment', '*Structural Homology, Protein', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/06/12 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/12 09:00'],"['2009/06/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2008.0078 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2009 Aug;29(8):461-8. doi: 10.1089/jir.2008.0078.,10.1089/jir.2008.0078 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it does not provide information on the distribution of molecular clusters. Different kinds of microscopies fill this gap.

Compared with classic type I CD20 antibodies (eg, rituximab), GA-101 binds with high affinity to the CD20 type II epitope, resulting in the induction of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity that is 5- to 100-fold greater than observed upon treatment with rituximab. GA-101 also exhibits superior direct cell killing properties than rituximab. In preclinical studies, GA-101 was significantly more potent and effective in depleting B-cells than rituximab, and induced dose-dependent antitumor activity, complete tumor regression and improved long-term survival in xenograft mouse models of B-cell malignancy. In a phase I/II clinical trial, GA-101 had a similar safety profile to rituximab, and exhibited promising efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory CD20-positive lymphoid malignancies. At the time of publication, phase I/II trials for GA-101 were ongoing in B-cell malignancies. Based on preclinical and preliminary clinical data, GA-101 appears to be a promising therapeutic agent for CD20-positive B-cell lymphoid malignances, including non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Department of Hematology, 93-510 Lodz, Ciolkowskiego 2, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Curr Opin Investig Drugs,"Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)",100965718,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Patents as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2009 Jun;10(6):588-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies revealed an association between CAD and megakaryoblastic leukemia factor-1 gene (MKL1). The association with a promoter SNP of MKL1, -184C > T, was found in a Japanese population and the association was replicated in another Japanese population and a Korean population.

Chemokines and their receptors have been implicated in several disease processes, particularly inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and cancer, and are therefore attractive targets for drug development. Chemokine receptors are members of the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. As such they can be studied using GPCR assays such as ligand binding, G protein activation, and downstream signaling processes such as intracellular calcium flux. In this respect assessing GPCR activation by GTP binding is an important tool to study the early stage of signal transduction. Previously this has been done using the radiolabeled non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue [(35)S]GTPgammaS. In order to avoid the problems involved in working with radioactivity, a new non-radioactive version of the assay has been developed using a europium-labeled GTP analogue in which europium-GTP binding can be assayed using time-resolved fluorescence. We have adapted this assay for chemokine receptors. In this chapter, using the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as an example, we describe the steps for assay optimization. In addition we describe adaptation of this assay for the high-throughput screening of chemokine antagonists.","['Labrecque, Jean', 'Wong, Rebecca S Y', 'Fricker, Simon P']","['Labrecque J', 'Wong RS', 'Fricker SP']","['AnorMED Corp., Langley, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '444W947O8O (Europium)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Drug Discovery', 'Europium/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay/*methods', 'Receptors, CXCR4/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60327-317-6_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;552:153-69. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-317-6_11.,10.1007/978-1-60327-317-6_11 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we explored the therapeutic application of beta-elemene in sensitizing lung cancer cells to cisplatin. beta-Elemene considerably enhanced the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines H460 and A549. Furthermore, this effect of beta-elemene on cisplatin activity occurred through the induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells, as assessed by an ELISA-based assay, TUNEL assay and annexin V binding assay. Consistent with these results, the protein levels of Bax and phospho-Bcl-2 increased and those of Bcl-2 and XIAP decreased in cells treated with beta-elemene in combination with cisplatin, compared with the levels in cells treated with either agent alone. Finally, beta-elemene augmented the cisplatin-induced increases in caspase-3, -7, -9 and -10 activities and cleaved caspase-3, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase levels in NSCLC cells. These observations suggest that beta-elemene sensitizes NSCLC cells to cisplatin via a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway involving Bcl-2 family proteins and IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins). Our data provide a rationale for developing a combination of beta-elemene and cisplatin as a regimen for the treatment of lung carcinoma and other cisplatin-resistant tumors.","['Li, Qingdi Q', 'Wang, Gangduo', 'Zhang, Manchao', 'Cuff, Christopher F', 'Huang, Lan', 'Reed, Eddie']","['Li QQ', 'Wang G', 'Zhang M', 'Cuff CF', 'Huang L', 'Reed E']","['The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, Robert C.

Although arsenic trioxide has been shown to significantly inhibit the growth of solid tumor cells in vitro, clinical trials indicate that arsenic trioxide alone is pool active against non-hematologic malignant diseases. To understand the mechanisms of arsenic resistance in solid tumor cells, we established two arsenic-resistant solid tumor cell lines, HepG2/AS and SGC7901/AS, isolated from human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901, respectively, by a series of stepwise selections via treatment with increasing concentrations of arsenic trioxide. Three ABC transporter proteins, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCC2, were expressed increasingly and differently in two arsenic-resistant cell lines. Further, tumor suppressor p53 was overexpressed in two arsenic-resistant cell lines, but the levels of p53 mediators MDM2 and gankyrin, which regulate the ubiquitination of p53, increased simultaneously. In addition, an increase in the phosphorylation of Rb at Ser795 in the two cell lines might also result from the presence of MDM2 and gankyrin, which suggest that the inactivation of p53 and Rb contribute to drug resistance. These two arsenic-resistant solid tumor cell lines, HepG2/AS and SGC7901/AS, may be useful for studying the mechanism of arsenic resistance in solid tumors and may provide a way to overcome it.","['Chen, Xi', 'Zhang, Mu', 'Liu, Lian-Xin']","['Chen X', 'Zhang M', 'Liu LX']","['General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, P.R.

The causative mutation of the PU.1-endocing Sfpi1 gene consists mostly of C:G to T:A transitions at a CpG site and is likely to be of spontaneous origin. To work out a mechanism underlying the association between radiation exposure and the AML induction, we have hypothesised that replicative stress after irradiation accelerates the ageing of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and the ageing-related decline in DNA repair could affect the spontaneous mutation rates. METHODS: Mathematical model analysis was conducted to examine whether and to what extent the cell kinetics of HSCs can be modified after irradiation. The haematopoietic differentiation process is expressed as a mathematical model and the cell-kinetics parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation result to the assay data. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that HSCs cycle vigourously for more than a few months after irradiation. The estimated number of cell divisions per surviving HSC in 3 Gy-exposed mice reached as high as ten times that of the unexposed. INTERPRETATION: The mitotic load after 3 Gy irradiation seems to be heavy enough to accelerate the ageing of HSCs and the hypothesis reasonably explains the leukaemogenic process.","['Ban, N', 'Kai, M']","['Ban N', 'Kai M']","['Department of Health Sciences, Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, 2944-9 Megusuno, Oita 870-1201, Japan. ban@oita-nhs.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090609,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mitosis/physiology/radiation effects', 'Models, Biological']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']","['6605135 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605135 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Jul 21;101(2):363-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605135.

AEP thereby destroys ASNase activity and may also potentiate antigen processing, leading to allergic reactions. Using AEP-mediated cleavage sequences, we modeled the effects of the protease on ASNase and created a number of recombinant ASNase products. The N24 residue on the flexible active loop was identified as the primary AEP cleavage site. Sole modification at this site rendered ASNase resistant to AEP cleavage and suggested a key role for the flexible active loop in determining ASNase activity. We therefore propose what we believe to be a novel mechanism of drug resistance to ASNase. Our results may help to identify alternative therapeutic strategies with the potential of further improving outcome in childhood ALL.","['Patel, Naina', 'Krishnan, Shekhar', 'Offman, Marc N', 'Krol, Marcin', 'Moss, Catherine X', 'Leighton, Carly', 'van Delft, Frederik W', 'Holland, Mark', 'Liu, Jizhong', 'Alexander, Seema', 'Dempsey, Clare', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Essink, Monika', 'Eden, Tim O B', 'Watts, Colin', 'Bates, Paul A', 'Saha, Vaskar']","['Patel N', 'Krishnan S', 'Offman MN', 'Krol M', 'Moss CX', 'Leighton C', 'van Delft FW', 'Holland M', 'Liu J', 'Alexander S', 'Dempsey C', 'Ariffin H', 'Essink M', 'Eden TO', 'Watts C', 'Bates PA', 'Saha V']","[""Cancer Research UK Children's Cancer Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['14840/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090608,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (asparaginyl endopeptidase, lysosomal)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cathepsin B/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']","['37977 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI37977 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2009 Jul;119(7):1964-73. doi: 10.1172/JCI37977.

Approximately 50% of NS patients have germline gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2. We provide evidence that conditional ablation of Stat3 in hematopoietic cells and cardiac valvular tissues leads to myeloid progenitor hyperplasia and pulmonary stenosis due to the leaflet thickening, respectively. Consistently, STAT3 activation is significantly compromised in peripheral blood cells from NS patients bearing Shp2-activating mutations. Biochemical and functional analyses demonstrate that activated Shp2 is able to down-regulate Tyr(P)-Stat3 and that constitutively active Stat3 rescues activating mutant Shp2-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor hypersensitivity in bone marrow cells. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Stat3 is an essential signaling component potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia caused by PTPN11 gain-of-function mutations.","['Zhang, Wenjun', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Chen, Hanying', 'Yang, Zhenyun', 'He, Yantao', 'Zhang, Xian', 'Luo, Yong', 'Yin, Fuqing', 'Moh, Akira', 'Miller, Lucy C', 'Payne, R Mark', 'Zhang, Zhong-Yin', 'Fu, Xin-Yuan', 'Shou, Weinian']","['Zhang W', 'Chan RJ', 'Chen H', 'Yang Z', 'He Y', 'Zhang X', 'Luo Y', 'Yin F', 'Moh A', 'Miller LC', 'Payne RM', 'Zhang ZY', 'Fu XY', 'Shou W']","['Herman B.

Current consensus, based on cytogenetic risk, recommends myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for poor-risk but not for good-risk AML. Allogeneic SCT, autologous transplantation, and consolidation chemotherapy are considered of equivalent benefit for intermediate-risk AML. OBJECTIVE: To quantify relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival benefit of allogeneic SCT for AML in CR1 overall and also for good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk AML. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective trials evaluating allogeneic SCT vs nonallogeneic SCT therapies for AML in CR1. The search used the combined search terms allogeneic; acut* and leukem*/leukaem*/leucem*/leucaem*/aml; myelo* or nonlympho* in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials databases in March 2009. The search identified 1712 articles. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective trials assigning adult patients with AML in CR1 to undergo allogeneic SCT vs nonallogeneic SCT treatment(s) based on donor availability and trials reporting RFS and/or overall survival outcomes on an intention-to-treat, donor vs no-donor basis were identified. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, 24 trials and 6007 patients were analyzed (5951 patients in RFS analyses and 5606 patients in overall survival analyses); 3638 patients were analyzed by cytogenetic risk (547, 2499, and 592 with good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk AML, respectively). Interstudy heterogeneity was not significant. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed. Compared with nonallogeneic SCT, the HR of relapse or death with allogeneic SCT for AML in CR1 was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86). Significant RFS benefit of allogeneic SCT was documented for poor-risk (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.84) and intermediate-risk AML (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85) but not for good-risk AML (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.80-1.42). The HR of death with allogeneic SCT for AML in CR1 was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.97). Significant overall survival benefit with allogeneic SCT was documented for poor-risk (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90) and intermediate-risk AML (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93) but not for good-risk AML (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.83-1.38). CONCLUSION: Compared with nonallogeneic SCT therapies, allogeneic SCT has significant RFS and overall survival benefit for intermediate- and poor-risk AML but not for good-risk AML in first complete remission.","['Koreth, John', 'Schlenk, Richard', 'Kopecky, Kenneth J', 'Honda, Sumihisa', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Djulbegovic, Benjamin J', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Cutler, Corey']","['Koreth J', 'Schlenk R', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Honda S', 'Sierra J', 'Djulbegovic BJ', 'Wadleigh M', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone RM', 'Sakamaki H', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Dohner H', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Cutler C']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA. john_koreth@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-36/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['301/22/2349 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2009.813 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2009 Jun 10;301(22):2349-61. doi: 10.1001/jama.2009.813.,10.1001/jama.2009.813 [doi],PMC3163846,['NIHMS263072'],45,['JAMA. 2009 Oct 21;302(15):1647; author reply 1647-8.

Although TAp73alpha and -beta proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration. However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha. Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells, K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis.","['Marques-Garcia, Fernando', 'Ferrandiz, Nuria', 'Fernandez-Alonso, Rosalia', 'Gonzalez-Cano, Laura', 'Herreros-Villanueva, Marta', 'Rosa-Garrido, Manuel', 'Fernandez-Garcia, Belen', 'Vaque, Jose P', 'Marques, Margarita M', 'Alonso, Maria Eugenia', 'Segovia, Jose Carlos', 'Leon, Javier', 'Marin, Maria C']","['Marques-Garcia F', 'Ferrandiz N', 'Fernandez-Alonso R', 'Gonzalez-Cano L', 'Herreros-Villanueva M', 'Rosa-Garrido M', 'Fernandez-Garcia B', 'Vaque JP', 'Marques MM', 'Alonso ME', 'Segovia JC', 'Leon J', 'Marin MC']","['Instituto de Biomedicina, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trp73 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (delta Np73 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Liver/embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(18)49465-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.026849 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Aug 7;284(32):21139-56. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.026849.

Nucleoside salvage, which depends on plasma membrane transport, can compromise the activity of antifolates. The cardiovascular drug dipyridamole inhibits nucleoside transport and enhances antifolate cytotoxicity in vitro, but its clinical activity is compromised by binding to the plasma protein alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP). We report the development of a novel pyrimidopyrimidine analogue of dipyridamole, NU3153, which has equivalent potency to dipyridamole, remains active in the presence of physiologic levels of AGP, inhibits thymidine incorporation into DNA, and prevents thymidine and hypoxanthine rescue from the multitargeted antifolate, pemetrexed. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of NU3153 suggested that a soluble prodrug would improve the in vivo activity. The valine prodrug of NU3153, NU3166, rapidly broke down to NU3153 in vitro and in vivo. Plasma NU3153 concentrations commensurate with rescue inhibition in vitro were maintained for at least 16 hours following administration of NU3166 to mice at 120 mg/kg. However, maximum inhibition of thymidine incorporation into tumors was only 50%, which was insufficient to enhance pemetrexed antitumor activity in vivo. Comparison with the cell-based studies revealed that pemetrexed enhancement requires substantial (> or =90%) and durable inhibition of nucleoside transport. In conclusion, we have developed non-AGP binding nucleoside transport inhibitors. Pharmacologically active concentrations of the inhibitors can be achieved in vivo using prodrug approaches, but greater potency is required to evaluate inhibition of nucleoside rescue as a therapeutic maneuver.","['Thomas, Huw D', 'Saravanan, Kappusamy', 'Wang, Lan-Zhen', 'Lin, Mei-Ju', 'Northen, Julian S', 'Barlow, Hannah', 'Barton, Marion', 'Newell, David R', 'Griffin, Roger J', 'Golding, Bernard T', 'Curtin, Nicola J']","['Thomas HD', 'Saravanan K', 'Wang LZ', 'Lin MJ', 'Northen JS', 'Barlow H', 'Barton M', 'Newell DR', 'Griffin RJ', 'Golding BT', 'Curtin NJ']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (NU 3153)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dipyridamole/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Orosomucoid/metabolism', 'Pemetrexed', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-08-1208 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1208 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Jul;8(7):1828-37. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1208.

To investigate the potential role of these enzymes as anticancer drug targets, we have synthesized novel benzylidene-thiazolidine-2,4-diones that function as potent Pim protein kinase inhibitors. With IC(50) values in the nanomolar range, these compounds block the ability of Pim to phosphorylate peptides and proteins in vitro and, when added to DU145 prostate cancer cells overexpressing Pim, inhibit the ability of this enzyme to phosphorylate a known substrate, the BH(3) protein BAD. When added to prostate cancer cell lines, including PC3, DU145, and CWR22Rv1, and human leukemic cells, MV4;11, K562, and U937 cells, these compounds induce G(1)-S cell cycle arrest and block the antiapoptotic effect of the Pim protein kinase. The cell cycle arrest induced by these compounds is associated with an inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and activity and translocation of the Pim-1 substrate p27(Kip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitory protein, to the nucleus. Furthermore, when added to leukemic cells, these compounds synergize with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin to decrease the phosphorylation level of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 at sites phosphorylated by mammalian target of rapamycin. Combinations of rapamycin and the benzylidene-thiazolidine-2,4-diones synergistically block the growth of leukemic cells.

However, despite significant preclinical and clinical developments, CDK inhibition biomarkers for predicting efficacy against certain cancers in individual patients have not been identified. Here, we characterized a macrocyclic quinoxalin-2-one CDK inhibitor, compound A, and identified a gene biomarker for predicting its efficacy. Compound A showed 100-fold selectivity for CDK family proteins over other kinases and inhibited both E2F transcriptional activity and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation. Compound A treatment resulted in decreased proliferation in various tumor cell lines; however, the apoptosis induction rate differed significantly among the cell lines examined, which was consistent with roscovitine. By comparing the mRNA expression profiles of sensitive and resistant cell lines, we found that expression levels of an endogenous CDK inhibitor, p18(INK4C), showed a strong negative correlation to the sensitivity. In fact, p18 status was correlated with the response to CDK inhibitor in an independent data set of multiple myeloma cell lines and silencing p18 expression increased the susceptibility of resistant cells to CDK inhibitors. The analysis of molecular mechanisms revealed that cells with lowered p18 had aberrant CDK6 and E2F activities, which resulted in a transcriptional down-regulation of Mcl-1, a key molecule associated with flavopiridol-induced apoptosis, thereby leading to susceptibility to therapeutic intervention with CDK inhibitors. These results identified a molecular basis for CDK inhibitors to exert an antitumor effect in p18-deficient cancers and support the clinical use of CDK inhibitors.","['Eguchi, Tomohiro', 'Itadani, Hiraku', 'Shimomura, Toshiyasu', 'Kawanishi, Nobuhiko', 'Hirai, Hiroshi', 'Kotani, Hidehito']","['Eguchi T', 'Itadani H', 'Shimomura T', 'Kawanishi N', 'Hirai H', 'Kotani H']","['Department of Cancer Research, Banyu Tsukuba Research Institute, Merck Research Laboratory, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090609,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrocyclic Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Quinoxalines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spodoptera', 'Transfection']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-08-1159 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1159 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Jun;8(6):1460-72. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1159.

They can reoccur after surgery or radiation, current treatments each with significant inherent risks. These risks are further amplified in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a germ line predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple schwannomas, underlying the need for biological targeted therapies. Gleevec (STI571, imatinib mesylate), in addition to the bcr-abl oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia, inhibits c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling, thereby expanding its use to several malignant and benign human diseases. In the present study, we show that human sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas have increased expression along with activation of PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, and c-kit receptors, compared with normal or traumatic nerve. Using the human NF2-null HEI-193 schwannoma cell line, Gleevec inhibited schwannoma viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth, as well as induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) 5-10 micromol/L). These antitumorigenic effects were correlated to inhibition of PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, and c-kit activation/phosphorylation and major downstream signaling pathways. Lack of robust xenograft or transgenic models of schwannomas prevents extension of these studies in vivo. However, the established long track record and tolerable toxicity of Gleevec already in clinical use and our preclinical data lead us to propose that Gleevec should be evaluated in human schwannomas with shown progressive growth.","['Mukherjee, Joydeep', 'Kamnasaran, Deepak', 'Balasubramaniam, Anand', 'Radovanovic, Ivan', 'Zadeh, Gelareh', 'Kiehl, Tim-Rasmus', 'Guha, Abhijit']","['Mukherjee J', 'Kamnasaran D', 'Balasubramaniam A', 'Radovanovic I', 'Zadeh G', 'Kiehl TR', 'Guha A']","['Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neurilemmoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4475 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4475 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 15;69(12):5099-107. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4475.

Here, we report its unique pharmacologic properties and antitumor activities in a variety of tumor types. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The potency of the compound was analyzed by fluorescence polarization competition binding assay. Its antiproliferative activities were assessed in 40 human cancer cell lines. Its pharmacologic properties and antitumor activities were evaluated in a variety of tumor xenograft models. RESULTS: CUDC-305 shows high affinity for HSP90alpha/beta (IC(50), approximately 100 nmol/L) and HSP90 complex derived from cancer cells (IC(50), 48.8 nmol/L). It displays potent antiproliferative activity against a broad range of cancer cell lines (mean IC(50), 220 nmol/L). CUDC-305 exhibits high oral bioavailability (96.0%) and selective retention in tumor (half-life, 20.4 hours) compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, CUDC-305 can cross blood-brain barrier and reach therapeutic levels in brain tissue. CUDC-305 exhibits dose-dependent antitumor activity in an s.c. xenograft model of U87MG glioblastoma and significantly prolongs animal survival in U87MG orthotopic model. CUDC-305 also displays potent antitumor activity in animal models of erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer and induces tumor regression in animal models of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer and MV4-11 acute myelogenous leukemia. Correlating with its efficacy in these various tumor models, CUDC-305 robustly inhibits multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK, and induces apoptosis.

Stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCR) may have prognostic effect in CLL progression. We tested the prognostic effect of stereotyped BCR for predicting RS transformation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The prevalence of stereotyped BCR was compared in RS (n = 69) versus nontransformed CLL (n = 714) by a case-control analysis. Subsequently, the effect of stereotyped BCR at CLL diagnosis on risk of RS transformation was actuarially assessed in a consecutive CLL series (n = 753). RESULTS: RS (n = 69) displayed a higher prevalence of stereotyped BCR (P < 0.001) compared with nontransformed CLL. The actuarial risk of RS transformation was significantly higher in CLL carrying stereotyped BCR (P < 0.001). Among BCR subsets most represented in CLL, subset 8 using IGHV4-39/IGHD6-13/IGHJ5 carried the highest risk of RS transformation [hazard ratio (HR), 24.50; P < 0.001]. Multivariate analysis selected stereotyped BCR (HR, 3.33; P = 0.001) and IGHV4-39 usage (HR, 4.03; P = 0.004) as independent predictors of RS transformation. The combination of IGHV4-39 usage and stereotyped BCR in the same patient identified CLL with a very high risk of RS transformation (5-year risk, 68.7%). The risk carried by stereotyped BCR and IGHV4-39 usage was specific for RS transformation and had no effect on CLL progression without transformation. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of BCR features may help identify CLL patients at risk of RS. A close monitoring and a careful biopsy policy may help early recognition of RS in CLL patients using stereotyped BCR, particularly if combined with IGHV4-39.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Spina, Valeria', 'Cerri, Michaela', 'Rasi, Silvia', 'Deambrogi, Clara', 'De Paoli, Lorenzo', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Cabras, Antonello', 'Lucioni, Marco', 'Martini, Maurizio', 'Magni, Michele', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Ladetto, Marco', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F', 'Besson, Caroline', 'Ramponi, Antonio', 'Canzonieri, Vincenzo', 'Paulli, Marco', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Larocca, Luigi M', 'Carbone, Antonino', 'Pileri, Stefano A', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Spina V', 'Cerri M', 'Rasi S', 'Deambrogi C', 'De Paoli L', 'Laurenti L', 'Maffei R', 'Forconi F', 'Bertoni F', 'Zucca E', 'Agostinelli C', 'Cabras A', 'Lucioni M', 'Martini M', 'Magni M', 'Deaglio S', 'Ladetto M', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Besson C', 'Ramponi A', 'Canzonieri V', 'Paulli M', 'Marasca R', 'Larocca LM', 'Carbone A', 'Pileri SA', 'Gattei V', 'Gaidano G']","['Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics/*physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Syndrome']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-3266 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3266 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jul 1;15(13):4415-22. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3266.

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate ESC self-renewal and proliferation is required before ESCs can fulfil their potential in regenerative therapies, and murine ESCs (mESCs) have been widely used as a model. Members of the class-IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family of lipid kinases regulate a variety of physiological responses, including cell migration, proliferation and survival. PI3Ks have been reported to regulate both proliferation and self-renewal of mESCs. Here we investigate the contribution of specific class-IA PI3K isoforms to the regulation of mESC fate using small-molecule inhibitors with selectivity for particular class-IA PI3K catalytic isoforms, and siRNA-mediated knockdown. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of p110beta promoted mESC differentiation, accompanied by a decrease in expression of Nanog. By comparison, pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of p110alpha had no effect on mESC self-renewal per se, but instead appeared to reduce proliferation, which was accompanied by inhibition of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and insulin-induced PI3K signalling. Our results suggest that PI3Ks contribute to the regulation of both mESC pluripotency and proliferation by differential coupling to selected p110 catalytic isoforms.","['Kingham, Emmajayne', 'Welham, Melanie']","['Kingham E', 'Welham M']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology and The Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 subunit, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.046557 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.046557 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2009 Jul 1;122(Pt 13):2311-21. doi: 10.1242/jcs.046557.

The calculation was inappropriately based on an exposure-response model for LH mortality instead of LH incidence. This is especially inappropriate for EO because EO exposure may not increase LH incidence except at high doses. The observed increases in LH mortality with EO exposure in males in the NIOSH epidemiology study, although not statistically significant, can be explained at all but the highest doses by exposure-dependent changes in the survival time between LH onset and LH mortality without any changes in LH incidence. Furthermore, EPA's life-table calculations of excess risk of incidence used formulas that are only appropriate for mortality. All of these concerns strongly suggest that EPA should limit their excess risk calculations to mortality unless they have data from an epidemiology study of incidence from which to derive an exposure-response model. What excess risks are calculated and how they are calculated is important for a scientifically-defensible regulatory assessment of EO and other substances.","['Sielken, Robert L Jr', 'Valdez-Flores, Ciriaco']","['Sielken RL Jr', 'Valdez-Flores C']","['Sielken & Associates Consulting Inc., 3833 South Texas Avenue, Suite 230, Bryan, TX 77802, USA.

At a cellular level, Notch signalling promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cells. In this study we aimed to identify novel transcriptional targets of Notch signalling in the T-ALL cell line, Jurkat. RESULTS: RNA was prepared from Jurkat cells retrovirally transduced with an empty vector (GFP-alone) or vectors containing constitutively active forms of Notch (N1DeltaE or N3DeltaE), and used for Affymetrix microarray analysis. A subset of genes found to be regulated by Notch was chosen for real-time PCR validation and in some cases, validation at the protein level, using several Notch-transduced T-ALL and non-T-ALL leukaemic cell lines. As expected, several known transcriptional target of Notch, such as HES1 and Deltex, were found to be overexpressed in Notch-transduced cells, however, many novel transcriptional targets of Notch signalling were identified using this approach. These included the T cell costimulatory molecule CD28, the anti-apoptotic protein GIMAP5, and inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (1D1). CONCLUSION: The identification of such downstream Notch target genes provides insights into the mechanisms of Notch function in T cell leukaemia, and may help identify novel therapeutic targets in this disease.","['Chadwick, Nicholas', 'Zeef, Leo', 'Portillo, Virginia', 'Fennessy, Carl', 'Warrander, Fiona', 'Hoyle, Sarah', 'Buckle, Anne-Marie']","['Chadwick N', 'Zeef L', 'Portillo V', 'Fennessy C', 'Warrander F', 'Hoyle S', 'Buckle AM']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocenter, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. n.chadwick@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-8-35 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-8-35 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2009 Jun 9;8:35. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-8-35.,10.1186/1476-4598-8-35 [doi],PMC2698846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus FLU or ITRA for prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients. METHODS: We used modeling techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus FLU or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The probabilities of experiencing an IFI, IFI-related death, and death from other causes over 100 days of follow-up were estimated from clinical trial data. Long-term mortality, drug costs, and IFI treatment costs were obtained from secondary sources. RESULTS: Posaconazole is associated with fewer IFIs per patient (0.05 vs. 0.11) relative to FLU or ITRA over 100 days of follow-up, and lower discounted costs ($3900 vs. $4500) and increased life-years (2.50 vs. 2.43 discounted) over a lifetime horizon. Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate that there is a 73% probability that posaconazole is cost saving versus FLU or ITRA and a 96% probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for posaconazole is at or below $50,000 per life-year saved. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that posaconazole is very likely to be a cost-effective alternative to FLU or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients with AML and MDS, and may result in cost savings.","[""O'Sullivan, Amy K"", 'Pandya, Ankur', 'Papadopoulos, George', 'Thompson, David', 'Langston, Amelia', 'Perfect, John', 'Weinstein, Milton C']","[""O'Sullivan AK"", 'Pandya A', 'Papadopoulos G', 'Thompson D', 'Langston A', 'Perfect J', 'Weinstein MC']","['i3 Innovus, Medford, MA, USA. amy.osullivan@i3innovus.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost Savings/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Econometric', 'Mycoses/economics/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/*complications/economics', 'United States']",2009/06/11 09:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1098-3015(10)60728-0 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00486.x [doi]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2009 Jul-Aug;12(5):666-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00486.x.,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00486.x [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is the most common subtype of chronic myeloproliferative diseases. Typically, CML evolves as a chronic phase (CP) disease that progresses into accelerated (AP) and blast phase (BP) stages. In this study, we show that IGF-IR is universally expressed in four CML cell lines. IGF-IR was expressed in only 30% and 25% of CP and AP patients, respectively, but its frequency of expression increased to 73% of BP patients. Increased expression levels of IGF-IR with CML progression was supported by quantitative real-time PCR that demonstrated significantly higher levels of IGF-IR mRNA in BP patients. Inhibition of IGF-IR decreased the viability and proliferation of CML cell lines and abrogated their growth in soft agar. Importantly, inhibition of IGF-IR decreased the viability of cells resistant to imatinib mesylate including BaF3 cells transfected with p210 BCR-ABL mutants, CML cell lines and primary neoplastic cells from patients. The negative effects of inhibition of IGF-IR were attributable to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest due to alterations of downstream target proteins. Our findings suggest that IGF-IR could represent a potential molecular target particularly for advanced stage or imatinib-resistant cases.","['Shi, Ping', 'Chandra, Joya', 'Sun, Xiaoping', 'Gergely, Mate', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Lai, Raymond', 'Amin, Hesham M']","['Shi P', 'Chandra J', 'Sun X', 'Gergely M', 'Cortes JE', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Lai R', 'Amin HM']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

The modulation of HLA-G expression can prove to be very important to therapeutic goals in some pregnancy complications, transplantation, cancer and possibly autoimmune diseases. In spite of substantial similarities with classical HLA-class I genes, HLA-G is characterized by a restricted tissue-specific expression in non-pathological situations. HLA-G expression is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level by a unique gene promoter when compared with classical HLA-class I genes, and at the post-transcriptional level including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, translation and protein transport to the cell surface. We focus on the characteristics of the HLA-G gene promoter and the factors which are involved in HLA-G transcriptional modulation. They take part in epigenetic mechanisms that control key functions of the HLA-G gene in the regulation of immune tolerance.","['Moreau, Philippe', 'Flajollet, Sebastien', 'Carosella, Edgardo D']","['Moreau P', 'Flajollet S', 'Carosella ED']","[""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, Direction des Sciences du Vivant, I2BM, Service de Recherches en Hemato-Immunologie, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France. philippe.moreau@cea.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090605,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HLA-G Antigens/*metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Response Elements', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/06/11 09:00,2011/12/24 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM800 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00800.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2009 Sep;13(9B):2973-89. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00800.x.

Pretransplantation ferritin > 1910 microg/l was associated with lower overall survival (P = 0.003), lower relapse-free survival (P = 0.003), decreased chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P = 0.019) and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (P = 0.042). Similar results were obtained when pretransplantation ferritin was analysed as a continuous variable and by quartiles. Our results indicate that an elevated pretransplant ferritin level adversely impacts transplantation outcomes. The adverse impact of elevated ferritin on NRM and survival was despite its association with lower incidences of acute and chronic GVHD, which are major causes of NRM. The association of ferritin with iron overload and its influence on HCT outcomes requires further prospective validation.","['Mahindra, Anuj', 'Bolwell, Brian', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Dean, Robert', 'Andresen, Steve', 'Sweetenham, John', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Copelan, Edward']","['Mahindra A', 'Bolwell B', 'Sobecks R', 'Rybicki L', 'Pohlman B', 'Dean R', 'Andresen S', 'Sweetenham J', 'Kalaycio M', 'Copelan E']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. mahinda@ccf.org']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090608,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*etiology/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/*blood/mortality', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7774 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07774.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Aug;146(3):310-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07774.x.

We here show that Hsp32 is expressed in most solid tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms and may be employed as a new therapeutic target as evidenced by experiments using specific siRNA and a Hsp32-targeting pharmacologic inhibitor. This Hsp-32 targeting drug, SMA-ZnPP, was found to inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells with IC(50) values ranging between 1 and 50 microM. In addition, SMA-ZnPP induced apoptosis in all neoplastic cells examined. Furthermore, SMA-ZnPP was found to synergize with other targeted and conventional drugs in producing growth-inhibition. Resulting synergistic effects were observed in all tumor and leukemia cells examined. Interestingly, several of the drug partners, when applied as single agents, induced the expression of Hsp32 in neoplastic cells, suggesting that synergistic effects resulted from SMA-ZnPP-induced ablation of a Hsp32-mediated survival-pathway that is otherwise used by tumor cells to escape drug-induced apoptosis. Together, Hsp32 is an important survival factor and target in solid tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms, and may be used to optimize anticancer therapy by combining conventional or targeted drugs with Hsp32-inhibitors. Based on these data, it seems desirable to explore the value of Hsp32-targeting drugs as anti-cancer agents in clinical trials.","['Gleixner, K V', 'Mayerhofer, M', 'Vales, A', 'Gruze, A', 'Hormann, G', 'Cerny-Reiterer, S', 'Lackner, E', 'Hadzijusufovic, E', 'Herrmann, H', 'Iyer, A K', 'Krauth, M-T', 'Pickl, W F', 'Marian, B', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R', 'Sillaber, C', 'Maeda, H', 'Zielinski, C', 'Valent, P']","['Gleixner KV', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Vales A', 'Gruze A', 'Hormann G', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Lackner E', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Herrmann H', 'Iyer AK', 'Krauth MT', 'Pickl WF', 'Marian B', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Sillaber C', 'Maeda H', 'Zielinski C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090801,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Metalloporphyrins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (copoly(styrene-maleic acid)-zinc protoporphyrin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Maleates/*pharmacology', 'Metalloporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polystyrenes/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CCDT-ABS-07 [pii]', '10.2174/156800909789057024 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2009 Aug;9(5):675-89. doi: 10.2174/156800909789057024.

In the case of mouse ES cells, addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to culture media is also necessary to prevent cell differentiation. Here, we report the use of primary human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) as feeder cells to culture mouse ES cells using our newly developed protocols. We found that mouse ES cells grown on hAECs express ES cell markers including FGF, Oct-4, Nanog, Sox-2, Rex, and TERT. Interestingly, the expression levels of these genes are three- to five fold higher on hAECs than on MEFs by quantitative real-time PCR. The quicker growing ES cells on hAECs showed a normal 19XY karyotype on passages 25, and ruled out the transformation of ES cells. Using flow cytometry analysis, we show that ES cells grown on hAECs have the same cell cycle distribution pattern as those on MEFs. Further, mouse ES cells cultured on hAECs for at least 20 passages retain the capability of teratoma formation in mice. Finally, we reveal that hAECs express highly LIF that allows for ES growth without the need of addition of commercially obtained LIF. Taken together, our data suggest that hAECs are suitable for mouse ES cell culture and may prove to be a useful alternative to MEFs for human ES cell culture.","['Lai, Dongmei', 'Cheng, Weiwei', 'Liu, Tianjin', 'Jiang, Lizheng', 'Huang, Qin', 'Liu, Te']","['Lai D', 'Cheng W', 'Liu T', 'Jiang L', 'Huang Q', 'Liu T']","['The International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University , Shanghai, PR China, 200030. laidm2003@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cloning Stem Cells,Cloning and stem cells,101125444,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Amnion/*cytology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques/*methods', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Pregnancy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Teratoma/metabolism/pathology']",2009/06/11 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/06/11 09:00'],"['2009/06/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/clo.2008.0047 [doi]'],ppublish,Cloning Stem Cells. 2009 Jun;11(2):331-40. doi: 10.1089/clo.2008.0047.,10.1089/clo.2008.0047 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report acute leukemia cell lines contain elevated levels of p-T451 PKR and PKR activity as compared to normal controls. Inhibition of PKR with a specific inhibitor, as well as overexpression of a dominant-negative PKR, inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death. Interestingly, PKR inhibition using the specific inhibitor resulted in a time-dependent augmentation of AKT S473 and GSK-3alpha S21 phosphorylation, which was confirmed in patient samples. Increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3alpha was not dependent on PI3K activity. PKR inhibition augmented levels of p-S473 AKT and p-S21/9 GSK-3alpha/beta in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, but was unable to augment GSK-3alpha or beta phosphorylation in the presence of the AKT inhibitor, A443654. Pre-treatment with the PKR inhibitor blocked the ability of A443654 and LY294002 to promote phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, indicating the mechanism leading to AKT phosphorylation and activation did not require eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The effects of PKR inhibition on AKT and GSK-3 phosphorylation were found to be, in part, PP2A-dependent. These data indicate that, in acute leukemia cell lines, constitutive basal activity of PKR is required for leukemic cell homeostasis and growth and functions as a negative regulator of AKT, thereby increasing the pool of potentially active GSK-3.","['Blalock, William L', 'Grimaldi, Cecilia', 'Fala, Federica', 'Follo, Matilde', 'Horn, Stefan', 'Basecke, Jorg', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Blalock WL', 'Grimaldi C', 'Fala F', 'Follo M', 'Horn S', 'Basecke J', 'Martinelli G', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","['Cell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21848 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2009 Oct;221(1):232-41. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21848.,10.1002/jcp.21848 [doi],,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pseudotyping of these vectors with the cat RD114 retrovirus envelope increases their potential for delivering genes into human hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we have further investigated the potential of the RD114 retrovirus in gene therapy. We describe and characterize an alternative retroviral packaging system derived from the RD114 retrovirus. METHODS: RD114-derived recombinant retroviruses were produced transiently by transfection of 293T cells, and viral titers were assessed on TE671 cells by measuring the percentage of infected green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Purified human hematopoietic cells (lymphocytes and CD34(+) cells) were activated and transduced on retronectin-coated plates. Two days later, the percentage of GFP positive cells was evaluated by FACS analysis. RESULTS: We demonstrate that RD114 viral particles could package MLV transfer vectors, and that, in addition to its natural envelope, RD114 cores could be efficiently pseudotyped by the Gibbon ape leukemia, the MLV-amphotropic and the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein envelopes. Furthermore, we found that RD114 viral particles were highly efficient to transduce human lymphocytes and CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration that replication-defective RD114 viral particles can be generated and used for efficient gene delivery into human hematopoietic cells. We conclude that RD114-derived vectors could be useful in the field of gene therapy.","['Ghani, Karim', 'Cottin, Sylvine', 'de Campos-Lima, Pedro Otavio', 'Caron, Marie-Christine', 'Caruso, Manuel']","['Ghani K', 'Cottin S', 'de Campos-Lima PO', 'Caron MC', 'Caruso M']","[""Le Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de l'Universite Laval, L'Hotel-Dieu de Quebec, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/genetics', '*Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.1351 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2009 Aug;11(8):664-9. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1351.,10.1002/jgm.1351 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of Hprt-deficient (6-thioguanine-resistant) mutant induction was subsequently determined. The results showed that after exposure to high LET value radiation (50.8 and 76.5 keV/microm), maximum mutation frequencies were seen at the G2/M phase, but after exposure to lower LET radiation (13.3 keV/microm), the highest mutation frequencies were observed at the G1 phase. The higher LET beam always produced higher mutation frequencies in the G2/M phase than in the G1 phase, regardless of radiation dose. These results suggest that cells in the G2/M phase is hyper-sensitive for mutation induction from high LET radiation, but not to mutation induction from low LET radiation. Molecular analysis of mutation spectra showed that large deletions (which could include almost entire exons) of the mouse Hprt gene were most efficiently induced in G2/M cells irradiated with high LET radiation. These entire exon deletions were not as frequent in cells exposed to lower LET radiation. This suggests that inappropriate recombination repair might have occurred in response to condensed damage in condensed chromatin in the G2/M phase. In addition, by using a hyper-sensitive mutation detection system (GM06318-10 cells), a reverse dose-rate effect was clearly observed after exposure to carbon beams with higher LET values (66 keV/microm), but not after exposure to beams with lower LET values (13.3 keV/microm). Thus, G2/M sensitivity towards mutation induction, and the dependence on radiation LET values could both be major factors involved in the reverse dose rate effect produced by high LET radiation.","['Tauchi, Hiroshi', 'Waku, Hiroyuki', 'Matsumoto, Eigo', 'Yara, Sayaka', 'Okumura, Shino', 'Iwata, Yoshiyuki', 'Komatsu, Kenshi', 'Furusawa, Yoshiya', 'Eguchi-Kasai, Kiyomi', 'Tachibana, Akira']","['Tauchi H', 'Waku H', 'Matsumoto E', 'Yara S', 'Okumura S', 'Iwata Y', 'Komatsu K', 'Furusawa Y', 'Eguchi-Kasai K', 'Tachibana A']","['Department of Biological Science, Faculty of Science, Ibaraki University, Ibaraki. htauchi@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090609,England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', '*Linear Energy Transfer', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis/*radiation effects', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/09033 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.09033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2009 Sep;50(5):441-8. doi: 10.1269/jrr.09033.

A major mechanism of cell necrosis is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which consists of multiple protein subunits, including adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). The threshold for mPTP opening is elevated by phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser9, which reduces activity of this kinase. How inactivation of GSK-3beta suppresses mPTP opening has not been fully understood, but evidence to date suggests that preservation of hexokinase-II in the mPTP complex, inhibition of cyclophilin-D-ANT binding, inhibition of p53 and inhibition of ANT into the mitochondria are contributory. GSK-3beta phosphorylation is a step to which multiple protective signaling pathways converge, and thus GSK-3beta phosphorylation is crucial in cardioprotection of a variety of interventions against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by pressure overload or ischemia/reperfusion is also suppressed by inactivation of GSK-3beta, in which reduced phosphorylation of p53, heat shock factor-1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 and inhibition of Bax translocation might be involved. Considering predominant roles of GSK-3beta in cardiomyocyte death, manipulation of this protein kinase is a promising strategy for myocardial protection in coronary artery disease and heart failure.","['Miura, Tetsuji', 'Miki, Takayuki']","['Miura T', 'Miki T']","['Division of Cardiology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, Japan. miura@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090609,Japan,Circ J,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,101137683,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cardiotonic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/pathology/*physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/pathology/*physiology', 'Necrosis/physiopathology']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/circj/CJ-09-0284 [pii]', '10.1253/circj.cj-09-0284 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ J. 2009 Jul;73(7):1184-92. doi: 10.1253/circj.cj-09-0284.

Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, we followed disease progression after serial transplantation of ZNF198-FGFR1-transformed stem cells that give rise to a distinct myeloproliferative disorder and T-lymphoblastic leukemia. A consistent, frequently homozygous, chr14:53880459-55011545 deletion, containing the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes, was identified in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes in all cases. The absence of cell-surface T-cell receptor alpha in tumor cells precludes CD3 recruitment, resulting in loss of a functional T-cell receptor complex, supporting the idea that prevention of maturation of CD4(+)/CD8(+) double-positive immature T cells is important in ZNF198-FGFR1 disease development. Up-regulation of the B-cell line 2, interleukin 7 receptor alpha and interleuking 2 receptor alpha prosurvival genes in these undifferentiated tumor precursor cells suggests one mechanism that allows them to escape apoptosis in the thymus.

This paper describes the expansion of a previously developed detailed model for N-linked glycosylation with the further application of the model to analyze MALDI-TOF mass spectra of human N-glycans in terms of underlying cellular enzyme activities. The glycosylation reaction network is automatically generated by the model, based on the reaction specificities of the glycosylation enzymes. The use of a molecular mass cutoff and a network pruning method typically limits the model size to about 10,000 glycan structures. This allows prediction of the complete glycan profile and its abundances for any set of assumed enzyme concentrations and reaction rate parameters. A synthetic mass spectrum from model-calculated glycan profiles is obtained and enzyme concentrations are adjusted to bring the theoretically calculated mass spectrum into agreement with experiment. The result of this process is a complete characterization of a measured glycan mass spectrum containing hundreds of masses in terms of the activities of 19 enzymes. In addition, a complete annotation of the mass spectrum in terms of glycan structure is produced, including the proportions of isomers within each peak. The method was applied to mass spectrometric data of normal human monocytes and monocytic leukemia (THP1) cells to derive glycosyltransferase activity changes underlying the differences in glycan structure between the normal and diseased cells. Model predictions could lead to a better understanding of the changes associated with disease states, identification of disease-associated biomarkers, and bioengineered glycan modifications.","['Krambeck, Frederick J', 'Bennun, Sandra V', 'Narang, Someet', 'Choi, Sean', 'Yarema, Kevin J', 'Betenbaugh, Michael J']","['Krambeck FJ', 'Bennun SV', 'Narang S', 'Choi S', 'Yarema KJ', 'Betenbaugh MJ']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA. fjkrambeck@reactech.net']",['eng'],['5R41CA127885-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090608,England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 2.4.- (Glycosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Glycosylation', 'Glycosyltransferases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/*chemistry/*enzymology', 'Polysaccharides/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Software', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2009/06/10 09:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cwp081 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwp081 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2009 Nov;19(11):1163-75. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwp081.

Such primary imatinib resistance is distinguished from secondary resistance which reemerges after attainment of cytogenetic remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied gene expression patterns in total WBCs using a panel of 21 genes previously implicated in TKI handling, resistance, or progression comparing patients who had newly diagnosed TKI-naive CML that had optimal (n = 41), or suboptimal (n = 7) responses to imatinib, or primary resistance (n = 20). Expression patterns were compared to those in secondary TKI-resistant chronic phase CML without ABL1 kinase domain mutations (n = 29), and to lymphoid (n = 15) or myeloid blast phase disease (n = 12). RESULTS: Fifteen genes in the panel distinguished blast phase from chronic phase disease, and 12 genes distinguished newly diagnosed CML from TKI-resistant CML without ABL1 kinase domain mutations, but only a single gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1/cyclooxgenase 1 (PTGS1/COX1; P = .005), differentiated imatinib-responsive from primary imatinib-resistant CML. The association of primary imatinib resistance with higher transcript levels of the drug metabolism gene PTGS1 was confirmed in a separate data set of 68 newly diagnosed, imatinib-treated CML (P = .008). In contrast, up to 11 different genes were identified in a multivariate model that optimally discriminated secondary imatinib resistance lacking ABL1 kinase domain mutation from imatinib-responsive cases, likely related to the more complex pathogenesis of secondary resistance. CONCLUSION: Gene expression profiling of CML at diagnosis for PTGS1 may be useful in predicting imatinib response and in selecting alternate therapy.","['Zhang, Wenyong W', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Yao, Hui', 'Zhang, Li', 'Reddy, Neelima G', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jones, Dan']","['Zhang WW', 'Cortes JE', 'Yao H', 'Zhang L', 'Reddy NG', 'Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Jones D']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P50CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090608,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Probability', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.4076 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.4076 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 1;27(22):3642-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.4076.

Such information is being incorporated into risk-stratified protocols; however, there are few data concerning prospective use of sequential minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring to identify more precisely those patients destined to experience relapse, which would allow more tailored therapies. METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assays to detect leukemia-specific transcripts (ie, PML-RARA, RARA-PML) were used to prospectively analyze 6,727 serial blood and marrow samples from 406 patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who were receiving all-trans-retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: MRD monitoring according to the recommended schedule successfully identified the majority of patients subject to relapse and provided the most powerful predictor of relapse-free survival (RFS) in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 17.87; 95% CI, 6.88 to 46.41; P < .0001); MRD monitoring was far superior to presenting WBC (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03; P = .02), which is currently widely used to guide therapy. In patients who were predicted to experience relapse on the basis of MRD monitoring, early treatment intervention with arsenic trioxide prevented progression to overt relapse in the majority, and the RFS rate at 1 year from molecular relapse was 73%. By using this strategy, 3-year cumulative incidence of clinical relapse was only 5% in the Medical Research Council AML15 trial. CONCLUSION: Rigorous sequential RQ-PCR monitoring provides the strongest predictor of RFS in APL and, when coupled with pre-emptive therapy, provides a valid strategy to reduce rates of clinical relapse. This provides a model for development of a more individualized approach to management of other molecularly defined subtypes of acute leukemia.","['Grimwade, David', 'Jovanovic, Jelena V', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Nugent, Elizabeth A', 'Patel, Yashma', 'Flora, Rajinder', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Jones, Katy', 'Aslett, Hannah', 'Batson, Elaine', 'Rennie, Kristian', 'Angell, Roger', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Wheatley, Keith', 'Burnett, Alan K']","['Grimwade D', 'Jovanovic JV', 'Hills RK', 'Nugent EA', 'Patel Y', 'Flora R', 'Diverio D', 'Jones K', 'Aslett H', 'Batson E', 'Rennie K', 'Angell R', 'Clark RE', 'Solomon E', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Wheatley K', 'Burnett AK']","[""Dept of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, 8th Floor, Tower Wing, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom. david.grimwade@genetics.kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['G0300133/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9800001/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090608,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.1533 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.1533 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 1;27(22):3650-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.1533.

Two main forms of inherited neutropenia are cyclic neutropenia, in which neutrophil counts oscillate with a 21-day frequency, and severe congenital neutropenia, in which static neutropenia may evolve at times into leukemia. Mutations of ELA2, encoding the protease neutrophil elastase, can cause both disorders. Among other genes, severe congenital neutropenia can also result from mutations affecting the transcriptional repressor Gfi1, one of whose genetic targets is ELA2, suggesting that the two act through similar mechanisms. In order to identify components of a common pathway regulating neutrophil production, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens with Gfi1 and neutrophil elastase and detected a novel protein, PFAAP5 (also known as N4BP2L2), interacting with both. Expression of PFAAP5 allows neutrophil elastase to potentiate the repression of Gfi1 target genes, as determined by reporter assays, RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and impairment of neutrophil differentiation in HSCs with PFAAP5 depletion, thus delineating a mechanism through which neutrophil elastase could regulate its own synthesis. Our findings are consistent with theoretical models of cyclic neutropenia proposing that its periodicity can be explained through disturbance of a feedback circuit in which mature neutrophils inhibit cell proliferation, thereby homeostatically regulating progenitor populations.","['Salipante, Stephen J', 'Rojas, Meghan E B', 'Korkmaz, Brice', 'Duan, Zhijun', 'Wechsler, Jeremy', 'Benson, Kathleen F', 'Person, Richard E', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Horwitz, Marshall S']","['Salipante SJ', 'Rojas ME', 'Korkmaz B', 'Duan Z', 'Wechsler J', 'Benson KF', 'Person RE', 'Grimes HL', 'Horwitz MS']","['Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Box 355065, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01DK58161/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32HD07463/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL79507/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 AG030316/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30AG030316/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079507/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL079574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007463/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058161/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090608,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (N4BP2L2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TACC2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutropenia/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00596-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00596-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Aug;29(16):4394-405. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00596-09.

The cholinergic components present in neurons are expressed in T cells where they constitute an independent cholinergic system. Both non-immunologic and immunologic stimulations can alter expression and function of cholinergic elements in T cells. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated regulation of immune system by auto/paracrine ACh, which provides a basis for development of new immunomodulatory therapies with nicotinic agonists. The purpose of our research is to integrate information about the structure and activity of the ACh regulatory axis with the phenotypic and functional alterations of T cells during their development and commitment. In this study, we used the Ach producing human leukemic T cell line CCRF-CEM (CEM) to investigate auto/paracrine mechanisms of T cell regulation through the nicotinic class of ACh receptors (nAChRs). The intact CEM expressed alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, alpha7, alpha 9, beta2 and beta4 nAChR subunits. Stimulation of CEM with 10 microg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 16 h upregulated expression of the alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, alpha9 and beta2 and downregulated that of alpha6 and beta4 subunits, indicating that TCR activation leads to overexpression of high Ca2+-permeable ACh-gated ion channels. Activation of alpha7- and alpha3 AChRs predominantly abrogated PHA-dependent upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma receptors, respectively, at the mRNA and protein levels. Signaling through alpha7 and alpha3 nAChRs also significantly (p<0.05) altered expression of the cell state regulators p21 and Bcl-2, respectively, suggesting that downregulation of inflammation via nAChRs includes effects on the T cell cycle progression and apoptosis. These findings indicate that constant stimulation of alpha7 and alpha3 nAChRs by endogenously released ACh controls T cell activation and that signaling downstream of distinct nAChR subtypes targets specific inflammatory and cell cycle genes. Learning the cholinergic pharmacology of inflammation should allow to regulate specific types of immune reactions by selectively activating or blocking the types of nAChRs expressed by the immune cells mediating specific immune reactions.","['Chernyavsky, A I', 'Arredondo, J', 'Galitovskiy, V', 'Qian, J', 'Grando, S A']","['Chernyavsky AI', 'Arredondo J', 'Galitovskiy V', 'Qian J', 'Grando SA']","['Center for Immunology and Departments of Dermatology and Biological Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['DE14173/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'ES014384/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,"['0 (Chrna7 protein, human)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Receptors, Nicotinic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor)', '0 (nicotinic receptor subunit alpha3)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholine/*metabolism', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Protein Subunits', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'Receptors, Nicotinic/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['23 [pii]', '10.1177/039463200902200223 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2009 Apr-Jun;22(2):461-72. doi: 10.1177/039463200902200223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Crude plant extracts were prepared using methanol and dichloromethane. The alkaloidal extracts from Solanecio angulatus flowers were prepared with and without zinc reduction using the acid-base extraction method. Cell proliferation inhibitory activity of the extracts and compounds was assessed using Alamarblue. KEY FINDINGS: The most active extract was the dichloromethane extract of Solanecio angulatus flowers, with an IC50 value of 12.17 microg/ml. The best selectivity index (SI > 41.08) was obtained for the same extract determined with HL-60 cells. The reduced alkaloidal extract prepared from S. angulatus flowers and after acid-base extraction showed more antitrypanosomal activity than unreduced alkaloidal extract with an IC50 value of 14.35 microg/ml and with a selectivity index of 12.23. The second most active extract was the dichloromethane extract of Crotalaria phillipsiae twigs with an IC50 value of 12.67 microg/ml and a selectivity index of 34.35. Most of the other extracts tested showed moderate antitrypanosomal activities to variable extents. Among the four pure pyrrolizidine alkaloids tested, senecionine showed moderate antitrypanosomal activity with an IC50 value of 41.78 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Solanecio angulatus (flowers) and Crotalaria phillipsiae (twigs) could serve as sources of novel trypanocidal compounds for the treatment of trypanosomiasis.","['Nibret, Endalkachew', 'Sporer, Frank', 'Asres, Kaleab', 'Wink, Michael']","['Nibret E', 'Sporer F', 'Asres K', 'Wink M']","['Institutut fur Pharmazie und Molekulare Biotechnologie, Universitst Heidelberg, im Neuenheimer Feld 364, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Asteraceae/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crotalaria/*chemistry', 'Ethiopia', 'Flowers/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Plant Stems/chemistry', 'Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Trypanocidal Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei/drug effects']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1211/jpp/61.06.0014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2009 Jun;61(6):801-8. doi: 10.1211/jpp/61.06.0014.,10.1211/jpp/61.06.0014 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the efficacy of the procedure, morbidity and mortality mainly caused by infections and organ toxicity remain serious problems. Due to the variety of conditioning regimens being applied before allo-SCT, one important aspect is represented by the toxicity profiles of the specific compounds, which are being applied for the reduction of the leukaemia cell load and for immunosuppression. This is being illustrated by the hepatotoxic profile of busulfan with its high rate of veno-occlusive disease. However, recent advances in our understanding of drug metabolism, progress in the measurement of drug concentration, and the invention of some new drugs and therapeutic approaches in the conditioning period are promising steps in achieving more safety for patients undergoing allo-SCT. Reduced-intensity conditioning concepts allow the inclusion of heavily pretreated patients or patients with severe co-morbidities in transplantation concepts. New prophylactic regimens, including poly- or monoclonal antibodies, result in reduced rates of graft-versus-host disease, and some 'new' drugs such as treosulfan or clofarabine widen the range of available conditioning regimens for specific situations.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Klyuchnikov, Evgeny', 'Wiedemann, Bettina', 'Kroeger, Nicolaus', 'Zander, Axel Rolf']","['Bacher U', 'Klyuchnikov E', 'Wiedemann B', 'Kroeger N', 'Zander AR']","['University Cancer Center Hamburg, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Martinistr. 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. u.bacher@uke.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/immunology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects/immunology']",2009/06/10 09:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740330902918273 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2009 May;8(3):305-15. doi: 10.1517/14740330902918273.,10.1517/14740330902918273 [doi],,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both a change in conformation (affinity) and in clustering (avidity/valency) of the receptors has been described to occur. This inside-out signaling is essential for adequate migration of leukocytes to inflammatory sites; however, the exact underlying mechanism is not known. We used two variants of a mouse acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line (L1210), a suspension (L1210-S) and an adherent (L1210-A) variant that were characterized by nonactivated and activated integrins (beta(1), beta(2) and beta(3)), respectively. L1210-S and L1210-A cells were compared on protein expression profiles by two-dimensional fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). We found 86 protein spots that were more than 1.25-fold different between L1210-A and L1210-S. Only 4 protein spots were more than 2.5-fold different. We identified 29 proteins by mass spectrometry among which were gelsolin, L-plastin, and Rho GTPase dissociation inhibitor 2. These proteins were upregulated in the L1210-A cells versus L1210-S, which was verified by Western blot analysis. Overexpression of gelsolin in U937 resulted in increased high affinity integrin expression and cell adhesion. Comparison of functionally different cell lines from similar origin by 2D-DIGE might be a successful approach to identify regulatory proteins involved in integrin inside-out control.","['Langereis, Jeroen D', 'Prinsen, Berthil H C M T', 'de Sain-van der Velden, Monique G M', 'Coppens, Cornelis J C', 'Koenderman, Leo', 'Ulfman, Laurien H']","['Langereis JD', 'Prinsen BH', 'de Sain-van der Velden MG', 'Coppens CJ', 'Koenderman L', 'Ulfman LH']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (ARHGDIG protein, human)', '0 (Arhgdig protein, mouse)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (plastin)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/*methods', 'Gelsolin/*analysis/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor gamma']",2009/06/10 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/06/10 09:00'],"['2009/06/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr8010815 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2009 Aug;8(8):3824-33. doi: 10.1021/pr8010815.,10.1021/pr8010815 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Proteome Res. 2010 Jan;9(1):636'],,,

For this study, a target of an E3 ubiquitin ligase was expressed as a fluorescently labeled protein in cell culture. If the E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates the degradation of a target protein in cell culture, it is expected that the target will show a reduced fluorescence signal by FCM analysis. We initially used the E3 ubiquitin ligase, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) and one of its targets, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, to determine the feasibility of our approach. Cells expressing a PML-GFP fusion protein were selected by cell sorting and infected with an adenoviral vector expressing ICP0. In contrast to mock-infected cells, only PML-GFP-expressing cells infected with the ICP0 adenoviral vector led to a significant decrease in the fluorescence signal of PML-GFP when examined by fluorescence microscopy and FCM analysis.

Sobral is highly endemic for leprosy, despite intensified eradication efforts and a 30% increase in primary care coverage since 1999. Of 329 active leprosy cases at two public clinics, 279 multibacillary patients were identified and six information-rich cases selected for in-depth ethnographic analysis, utilizing illness narratives, key-informant interviews, home visits, participant-observation of clinical consultations and semi-structured interviews with physicians. A 'contextualized semantic interpretation' revealed four leprosy metaphors: a repulsive rat's disease, a racist skin rash, a biblical curse and lethal leukemia. Far from value-free pathology, the disease is imbued with moral significance. Patients' multivocalic illness constructions contest physicians' disease discourse. 'Skin Spot Day' discriminates more than educates. Patients' 'non-compliance' with effective multi-drug therapy is due to demoralizing stigma more than a rejection of care.

GO consists of a humanized anti-CD33 antibody (hP67.6) which is linked to N-acetyl-gamma calicheamicin 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine dichloride. Once the antibody attaches to the surface antigen, it is rapidly internalized. Calicheamicin, a potent enediyne, is subsequently released and acts as a cytotoxic anti-tumor agent.

The efficacy of GO as monotherapy and in combination therapy for treatment of both de novo and relapsed AML continues to be investigated.","['Duong, Hien K', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Duong HK', 'Sekeres MA']","['Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090514,New Zealand,Clin Interv Aging,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/09 09:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2147/cia.s3968 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Interv Aging. 2009;4:197-205. doi: 10.2147/cia.s3968.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the salient apheresis features of a group of 175 allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplants conducted in two institutions in a 7-year period. The grafts were conducted using the ""Mexican"" non-myelo ablative conditioning regimen employing oral busulphan, i.v. cyclophosphamide and i.v. fludarabine. In all instances, the apheresis machine employed was the Baxter CS3000 Plus and donors were mobilised with filgrastim. The apheresis procedures were performed on days 0, +1 and +2, the end-point of collection being 5,000 mL of blood/m2 in each procedure. Three apheresis sessions were planned but the number was adjusted according to the cell yield. RESULTS: The final number of allografted CD34 cells ranged between 0.5 and 25.4 x 10(6)/Kg of the recipient's body weight (median, 5.2 x 10(6)/Kg). One to three apheresis procedures were needed to obtain a product containing more than 0.5 x 10(6) CD34 cells/Kg of the recipient, the median being two procedures; in 72 cases (41%) a single apheresis procedure was sufficient to obtain the target number of CD34 cells. The volumes of apheresis ranged between 50 and 600 mL (median, 400 mL). CONCLUSIONS: Since the median cost of each apheresis procedure is 900 USD, the fact that two apheresis procedures was spared in 72 cases and one apheresis was spared in another 65 cases, led to a total saving of approximately 188,100 USD. It can be concluded that, in many cases, allogeneic transplants can be completed with a single apheresis session and that there are considerable financial benefits from this practice.","['Ruiz-Delgado, Guillermo J', 'Gutierrez-Riveroll, Karla I', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Cesar H', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Eyzaguirre-Zapata, Renee', 'Priesca-Marin, Manuel', 'Gonzalez-Carrillo, Martha L', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J']","['Ruiz-Delgado GJ', 'Gutierrez-Riveroll KI', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre CH', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Eyzaguirre-Zapata R', 'Priesca-Marin M', 'Gonzalez-Carrillo ML', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, 8B Sur 3710, 72530 Puebla, PUE - Mexico. gruiz2@clinicaruiz.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Italy,Blood Transfus,Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,101237479,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Removal/economics/*methods', '*Blood Donors', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', '*Catheter Ablation', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Mexico', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/09/12 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2450/2008.0054-08 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Transfus. 2009 Apr;7(2):127-31. doi: 10.2450/2008.0054-08.,10.2450/2008.0054-08 [doi],PMC2689067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['allografts', 'apheresis', 'costs saving', 'transplantation']",,,,

To investigate roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) on epigenetic therapy of gastric cancer, the miRNA expression profile was analysed in human gastric cancer cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). miRNA microarray analysis shows that most of miRNAs activated by 5-Aza-CdR and PBA in gastric cancer cells are located at Alu repeats on chromosome 19. Analyses of chromatin modification show that DNA demethylation and HDAC inhibition at Alu repeats activates silenced miR-512-5p by RNA polymerase II. In addition, activation of miR-512-5p by epigenetic treatment induces suppression of Mcl-1, resulting in apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that chromatin remodeling at Alu repeats plays critical roles in the regulation of miRNA expression and that epigenetic activation of silenced Alu-associated miRNAs could be a novel therapeutic approach for gastric cancer.","['Saito, Y', 'Suzuki, H', 'Tsugawa, H', 'Nakagawa, I', 'Matsuzaki, J', 'Kanai, Y', 'Hibi, T']","['Saito Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Tsugawa H', 'Nakagawa I', 'Matsuzaki J', 'Kanai Y', 'Hibi T']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090608,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7WY7YBI87E (4-phenylbutyric acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase III)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['*Alu Elements', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Polymerase II/physiology', 'DNA Polymerase III/physiology', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phenylbutyrates/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/08/12 09:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [medline]']","['onc2009140 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Jul 30;28(30):2738-44. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.140.

Few selective target genes in cancer stem cells have been identified. Here we identify the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene (Alox5) as a critical regulator for leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the absence of Alox5, BCR-ABL failed to induce CML in mice. This Alox5 deficiency caused impairment of the function of LSCs but not normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through affecting differentiation, cell division and survival of long-term LSCs (LT-LSCs), consequently causing a depletion of LSCs and a failure of CML development. Treatment of CML mice with a 5-LO inhibitor also impaired the function of LSCs similarly by affecting LT-LSCs, and prolonged survival. These results demonstrate that a specific target gene can be found in cancer stem cells and its inhibition can completely inhibit the function of these stem cells.","['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Hu, Yiguo', 'Zhang, Haojian', 'Peng, Cong', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Chen Y', 'Hu Y', 'Zhang H', 'Peng C', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA122142-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114199-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114199-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122142-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122142-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090607,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/metabolism']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/07/18 09:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2008/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [medline]']","['ng.389 [pii]', '10.1038/ng.389 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2009 Jul;41(7):783-92. doi: 10.1038/ng.389.

We characterized the H60-specific CD8 T-cell response as CD4 help dependent. This study investigated the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires during the evolution of H60-specific CD8 T-cell responses and influence of CD4 help on the diversity. METHODS: Ex vivo TCR V beta and complementarity-determining region 3 length spectratypic and clonotypic analyses were performed using H60-tetramer-binding CD8 T cells purified from the mice undergoing the primary, secondary, and tertiary responses with cognate help, and the secondary response with noncognate separate CD4 help. RESULTS: Involvement of a broad spectrum of TCRs was observed in the H60-specific primary response. With the involvement of diverse V beta families in the secondary and tertiary responses, complementarity-determining region 3 length and clonotypic diversities within the V beta subfamilies gradually decreased throughout the response evolution. In tertiary repertoires, the usage of V beta 8.3 and focused clonal usage within each V beta subfamily were prominent. When noncognate separate CD4 help was provided during the induction of H60-specific secondary responses, extremely limited TCRs constituted the repertoire of reactive CD8 T cells, and most of these TCRs coincided with those observed in the secondary or tertiary repertoires provided with cognate help. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to characterize the diversity of TCRs specific for hematopoietic cell-specific mouse minor H antigens and demonstrate the effect of CD4 help on CD8 TCR repertoire diversity. Our data provide a basis for modeling therapeutic applications.","['Choi, Jung Hwa', 'Ryu, Su Jeong', 'Jung, Kyung Min', 'Kim, Sol', 'Chang, Jun', 'Kim, Tae Woo', 'Choi, Eun Young']","['Choi JH', 'Ryu SJ', 'Jung KM', 'Kim S', 'Chang J', 'Kim TW', 'Choi EY']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Variation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/transplantation']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181a52dc4 [doi]', '00007890-200906150-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Jun 15;87(11):1609-16. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181a52dc4.,10.1097/TP.0b013e3181a52dc4 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms involved in retroviral-mediated activation of proto-oncogenes influence the distribution of insertions within specific regions during tumorigenesis and hence may point to novel gene structures. From a retroviral tagging screen on tumors of 1767 SL3-3 MLV-infected BALB/c mice, intron 2 of the AP-1 repressor Jdp2 locus was found frequently targeted by proviruses resulting in upregulation of non-canonical RNA subspecies. We identified several promoter regions within 1000 bp upstream of exon 3 that allowed for the production of Jdp2 protein isoforms lacking the histone acetylase inhibitory domain INHAT present in canonical Jdp2. The novel Jdp2 isoforms localized to the nucleus and over-expression in murine fibroblast cells induced cell death similar to canonic Jdp2. When expressed in the context of oncogenic NRAS both full length Jdp2 and the shorter isoforms increased anchorage-independent growth. Our results demonstrate a biological function of Jdp2 lacking the INHAT domain and suggest a post-genomic application for the use of retroviral tagging data in identifying new gene products with a potential role in tumorigenesis.","['Rasmussen, Mads Heilskov', 'Wang, Bruce', 'Wabl, Matthias', 'Nielsen, Anders Lade', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Rasmussen MH', 'Wang B', 'Wabl M', 'Nielsen AL', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, Arhus, DK 8000, Denmark.']",['eng'],['R01A141570/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090605,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Jundp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Genes, ras', 'Introns', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', 'Repressor Proteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']","['gkp469 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkp469 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Aug;37(14):4657-71. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp469.

Numerous active compounds isolated from Brazilian Cerrado plant species have been studied with promising results. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the cytotoxic potential of 412 extracts from Brazilian Cerrado plants used in traditional medicine belonging to 21 families against tumor cell lines in culture. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Maceration of 50 plant species resulted in 412 hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol and hydroalcohol extracts. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was tested against human colon carcinoma (HCT-8), melanoma (MDA-MB-435), and brain (SF-295) tumor cell lines, using the thiazolyl blue test (MTT) assay. Bioassay-guided fractionation was performed for one active extract. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-eight of the 412 tested extracts demonstrated a substantial antiproliferative effect, at least 85% inhibition of cell proliferation at 50 microg/mL against one or more cell lines. Those extracts are obtained from different parts of Anacardiaceae, Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Clusiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Sapindaceae, Sapotaceae, Simaroubaceae and Zingiberaceae. Complete dose-response curves were generated and IC(50) values were calculated for these active extracts against four cell lines HCT-8, MDA-MB-435, SF-295 and HL-60 (leukemia), and their direct cytotoxic effects were determined. In summary, 14 extracts of 13 species showed toxicity in all tested tumor cell lines, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.1 to 19.1 microg/mL. The strongest cytotoxic activity was found for the hexane extract of Casearia sylvestris var. lingua stem bark, with an IC(50) of 0.1 microg/mL for HCT-8, 0.9 microg/mL for SF-295, 1.2 microg/mL for MDA-MB-435, and 1.3 microg/mL for HL-60, and Simarouba versicolor root bark, with an IC(50) of 0.5 microg/mL for HCT-8, 0.7 microg/mL for SF-295, 1.5 microg/mL for MDA-MB-435, 1.1 microg/mL for HL-60. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the last extract led to the isolation of glaucarubinone, which showed pronounced activity against the four cell lines studied.

AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effect on angiogenesis of polysaccharides from mycelia of Antrodia cinnamomea (PMAC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: PMAC were extracted in boiling water, precipitated with 95% ethanol, and separated into four different molecular weights (<5, 5-30, 30-100, > 100 kDa). Tube formation and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were used to determine the in vitro and ex vivo anti-angiogenic effects. RESULTS: Only the PMAC-mononuclear cells (MNCs)-conditioned medium (CM) with MW > 100 kDa significantly and concentration-dependently decreased the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in human leukemia cells and inhibited the matrigel tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Similarly only the PMAC-MNC-CM with MW > 100 kDa significantly and concentration-dependently increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In addition, the ex vivo CAM assay revealed that only the PMAC with MW>100 kDa significantly and dose-dependently inhibited neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: PMAC with MW > 100 kDa are anti-angiogenic in vitro and ex vivo, and the effects are likely through immunomodulation.","['Yang, Chih-Min', 'Zhou, Yu-Jie', 'Wang, Ran-Juh', 'Hu, Miao-Lin']","['Yang CM', 'Zhou YJ', 'Wang RJ', 'Hu ML']","['Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National Chung Hsing University, 250 Kuo Kuang Road, Taichung 402, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090331,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antrodia/*chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mycelium', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(09)00190-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.034 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2009 Jun 25;123(3):407-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.034.

It has been reported that gp130 has 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain, and nine of them are actually N-glycosylated. However, the structure and functional role of the carbohydrate chains carried by gp130 are totally unknown. In this study, we examined the functional role of N-glycans of gp130 in mouse neuroepithelial cells. In neuroepithelial cells treated with tunicamycin, an N-glycosylation inhibitor, unglycosylated form of gp130 was detected. The unglycosylated gp130 was not phosphorylated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation. Although the unglycosylated gp130 was found to be expressed on the cell surface, it could not form a heterodimer with leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. These results suggest that N-glycans are required for the activation, but not for the localization, of gp130 in neuroepithelial cells.","['Yanagisawa, Makoto', 'Yu, Robert K']","['Yanagisawa M', 'Yu RK']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. myanagisawa@mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['AG027199/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS011853/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AG027199/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS011853-33/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS026994-19/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS11853/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS045543/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS026994/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS045543-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS26994/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090606,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/agonists/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/07/28 09:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/28 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)01113-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Aug 14;386(1):101-4. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.132.

She was catheterized and a large residual of urine was obtained; she was discharged home. She returned the following day with the same complaint. Plain radiographs suggested a soft tissue density in the pelvic region with no evidence of constipation. Rectal examination revealed a mass, and a computed tomography scan showed a large, solid mass. Pathological examination confirmed a pelvic neuroblastoma, which was resected. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causes of acute urinary retention are urinary tract infections, lower urinary stones, neurologic processes, trauma, and constipation.

OBJECTIVES: To present the potential complications from extreme leukocytosis. CASE REPORT: A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with chest pain, right-sided weakness, and decreased responsiveness. He was diagnosed with both an acute stroke and myocardial infarction due to extreme leukocytosis from acute myeloid leukemia. Each of these complications by itself would be an unusual manifestation of hyperleukocytosis. To the best of the author's knowledge, this represents the first reported case of these two complications simultaneously from extreme leukocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute leukemia may present with hyperleukocytosis, which may result in decreased tissue perfusion. Ischemia occurring in the heart can lead to an acute myocardial infarction, whereas ischemia in the brain can lead to a stroke. These events may, on occasion, be the initial presentation of leukemia. Rapid identification and treatment of the hyperleukocytosis may prevent these complications.","['Muniz, Antonio E']",['Muniz AE'],"['Department of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090604,United States,J Emerg Med,The Journal of emergency medicine,8412174,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chest Pain/etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Myocardial Infarction/*etiology', 'Stroke/*etiology']",2009/06/09 09:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2008/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0736-4679(09)00330-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.04.061 [doi]']",ppublish,J Emerg Med. 2012 Jun;42(6):651-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.04.061.

In this study, we prospectively evaluated the impact of donor and recipient activating KIR genes on outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: One-hundred consecutive recipients of myeloablative transplantation and their donors were tested for KIR genotype as well as for immune reconstitution, including activating KIR expression on NK cells and T cells. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, mismatches of particular activating KIRs such that the patient was negative and the donor was positive (P-D+) resulted in increased risk of acute (KIR2DS1) and chronic (KIR2DS3) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as well as relapse (KIR2DS5). KIR2DS1 incompatibility in the same direction in the presence of HLA-C-group 2 ligand in recipient was associated with reduced overall (risk ratio, RR = 3.01; P = 0.01) and disease-free survival (RR = 2.92, P = 0.03). Activating mismatches in P-D+ direction resulted in decreased CD4+ : CD8+ T-cell ratio up to 1 yr after alloHSCT, as a consequence of decreased CD3+CD4+ number within the first 100 d and increased CD3+CD8+ number in later time-points. Among six evaluated patients, expression of activating KIRs on NK cells and T cells was particularly prominent for those developing intestinal GVHD. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the presence of particular activating KIRs in donor with their absence in recipient enhances GVHD, which is not accompanied by graft-versus-leukemia effect. Evaluation of activating KIR genotype may allow optimization of both donor selection and transplantation procedure in order to avoid GVHD.","['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Nowak, Izabela', 'Dziaczkowska, Joanna', 'Czerw, Tomasz', 'Wojnar, Jerzy', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Holowiecki, Jerzy', 'Holowiecka-Goral, Aleksandra', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Kopera, Malgorzata', 'Karolczyk, Agnieszka', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Kusnierczyk, Piotr']","['Giebel S', 'Nowak I', 'Dziaczkowska J', 'Czerw T', 'Wojnar J', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Holowiecki J', 'Holowiecka-Goral A', 'Markiewicz M', 'Kopera M', 'Karolczyk A', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Kusnierczyk P']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland. sgiebel@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090602,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (KIR2DS3 protein, human)', '0 (KIR2DS5 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Receptors, KIR/genetics/*immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1280 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01280.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Oct;83(4):343-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01280.x.

METHODS: We studied PB, BM smears in 35 cases of aCML and compared with 84 cases of chronic granulocytic leukemia chronic phase (CGL-CP), 39 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In addition, we evaluated characteristics of BM trephine biopsies in 21 cases of aCML and compared with 68 cases of CGL-CP, 20 cases of CMML. RESULTS: All aCML patients presented with leukocytosis (median WBC 17.3 x 10(9)/L), 48% had moderate anemia, and 85% had thrombocytopenia. Values of monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, percentage of immature granulocytes and monocytes (0.63 +/- 0.41 x 10(9)/L, 0.18 +/- 0.16 x 10(9)/L, 0.09 +/-0.08 x 10(9)/L, 6.27 +/- 3.09%, and 2.46 +/- 1.75%, respectively) were useful in distinguishing aCML from CGL-CP and CMML groups. The BM smears showed that striking dysgranulopoieis (100%), dyserythropoiesis (48.6%), percentage of blasts, nucleated erythrocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils (2.45 +/- 2.06%, 7.76 +/- 2.89%, 1.30 +/- 1.21%, 1.47 +/- 1.60%, and 1.15 +/- 1.08%, respectively) were all important parameters for a diagnosis of aCML. On BM trephine sections, aCML was characterized as hypercellularity, a moderate degree of reticulin fibrosis (71.4%), lymphocytopenia (76.2%), plasmacytopenia (90.5%), abnormal localization of immature precursors (28.5%), and absence of eosinophilia, basophilia, monocytosis. Furthermore, BM imprints, immunohistochemical, and cytochemical staining findings provided important morphological reference to BM trephine sections and made the identification of nucleated cells more convenient. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the findings observed in PB and BM aspirate, features of BM trephine biopsy (including BM trephine section, BM imprint, immunohistochemical, and cytochemical staining) can also aid in the diagnosis of aCML.","['Xubo, Gong', 'Xingguo, Lu', 'Xianguo, Wu', 'Rongzhen, Xu', 'Xibin, Xiao', 'Lin, Wang', 'Lei, Zhu', 'Xiaohong, Zhang', 'Genbo, Xu', 'Xiaoying, Zhao']","['Xubo G', 'Xingguo L', 'Xianguo W', 'Rongzhen X', 'Xibin X', 'Lin W', 'Lei Z', 'Xiaohong Z', 'Genbo X', 'Xiaoying Z']","['Departments of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090602,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1283 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01283.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Oct;83(4):292-301. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01283.x.

We also aimed to investigate whether the peripheral circadian machinery may be deregulated in CLL cells. The expression of CRY1, PER1, and PER2 was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 116 CLL patients. The expression at sequential time points over a 24-h period was measured in six CLL patients and six normal donors. We confirmed the differential expression of CRY1 in ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+) and ZAP-70(-)/CD38(-) CLL samples. Subgroups formed according to CRY1 expression levels differed significantly in time to treatment. This difference was even more pronounced for subgroups stratified by a CRY1 : PER2 expression ratio and the ratio was an independent prognostic marker in a multivariate model. Furthermore, our data indicate disturbances in the periodic expression of circadian genes in CLL cells. Because of their role in the expression of cell cycle-related and DNA-damage response genes, we suggest that the deregulated expression of circadian genes may be linked to the molecular pathogenesis of CLL.","['Eisele, Lewin', 'Prinz, Robert', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Lowinski, Kerstin', 'Thomale, Jurgen', 'Moeller, Lars C', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Durig, Jan']","['Eisele L', 'Prinz R', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Nuckel H', 'Lowinski K', 'Thomale J', 'Moeller LC', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Hufelandstrasse 55, Essen, Germany. lewin.eisele@uni-due.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090602,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CRY1 protein, human)', '0 (Cryptochromes)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PER2 protein, human)', '0 (Period Circadian Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronobiology Disorders/genetics', 'Circadian Rhythm/genetics', 'Cryptochromes', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Female', 'Flavoproteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Period Circadian Proteins', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/09 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/06/09 09:00'],"['2009/06/09 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1287 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01287.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Oct;83(4):320-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01287.x.

Indexes of interaction of FITC-conjugated Becton Dickinson Pharmingen monoclonal antibodies to external Pgp epitope (clone 17F9) were analyzed depending on the cell concentration (400000 to 3000000 cells/ml) and the specific antibody concentration (5, 10 and 20 microl of the market product solution per 300 microl of the cell suspension).

Early identification of children ""at risk"" for neurocognitive problems is not yet reliable. Biomarkers of oxidative stress (e.g., oxidated phosphatidylcholine) in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) have been correlated with intensity of methotrexate (MTX) treatment, suggesting an association with acute central nervous system toxicity. PROCEDURE: This study examined the association between oxidized CSF phospholipids and executive functions throughout chemotherapy. Measures of oxidative stress and executive functions were examined in 88 children newly diagnosed with ALL. The children were followed over 3 years with neurocognitive testing and parent ratings of executive functions. RESULTS: Results demonstrated an association between increased oxidative stress following induction and consolidation and decreased executive function 2 years later. Younger age at diagnosis was associated with both an increase in oxidative stress and in executive dysfunction; younger age was associated with poorer ability to organize materials in one's environment (r(48) = 0.28, P < 0.05) and with greater oxidated phosphatidylcholine in CSF at the end of chemotherapy (r(48) = -0.27, P < 0.05). As such, younger age appears to be the most prominent moderator of neurocognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: These results link functional changes to CSF biomarkers and underscore the importance of monitoring cognitive development in young children treated for ALL.

METHOD: Utilizing a multiparameter flow cytometric chemosensitivity assay (FCCA), we studied the relationship between in vitro drug sensitivity of diagnostic leukemic blasts from 30 children with ALL and rapidity of response to induction therapy. We also analyzed the in vitro drug sensitivity of de novo leukemic blasts among various clinical subsets. RESULTS: Compared to rapid early responders (RERs), slow early responders (SERs) had a significantly greater in vitro drug resistance to dexamethasone (DEX; P = 0.04) and prednisone (P = 0.05). The studies with all other drugs showed a non-significant trend with the SER having a higher in vitro drug resistance compared to the RER. Risk group stratified analyses indicated that in vitro resistance to asparaginase (ASP), DEX, and vincristine (VCR) were each significantly related to having very high risk ALL. Additionally, a significantly higher in vitro drug resistance to ASP and VCR was associated with unfavorable lymphoblast genetics and ultimate relapse. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that this FCCA is a potentially simple and rapid method to detect inherent resistance to initial ALL therapy very early in induction, thus allowing for treatment modification shortly thereafter.","['Galderisi, Faith', 'Stork, Linda', 'Li, Ju', 'Mori, Motomi', 'Mongoue-Tchokote, Solange', 'Huang, James']","['Galderisi F', 'Stork L', 'Li J', 'Mori M', 'Mongoue-Tchokote S', 'Huang J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],"['UL1 RR024140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024140-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/09 06:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22119 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Oct;53(4):543-50. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22119.,10.1002/pbc.22119 [doi],PMC2775428,['NIHMS123064'],,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Oct;53(4):525-6.

MCV T antigen expression in Merkel cell carcinoma, lymphoid tissues and lymphoid tumors.",1243-9,"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a recently discovered human virus closely related to African green monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus. MCV DNA is integrated in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC), a neuroendocrine skin cancer linked to lymphoid malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To assess MCV infection and its association with human diseases, we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes endogenous and transfected MCV large T (LT) antigen. We show expression of MCV LT protein localized to nuclei of tumor cells from MCC having PCR quantified MCV genome at an average of 5.2 (range 0.8-14.3) T antigen DNA copies per cell. Expression of this putative viral oncoprotein in tumor cells provides the mechanistic underpinning supporting the notion that MCV causes a subset of MCC. In contrast, although 2.2% of 325 hematolymphoid malignancies surveyed also showed evidence for MCV infection by DNA PCR, none were positive at high viral copy numbers, and none of 173 lymphoid malignancies examined on tissue microarrays expressed MCV LT protein in tumor cells. As with some of the other human polyomaviruses, lymphocytes may serve as a tissue reservoir for MCV infection, but hematolymphoid malignancies associated with MCC are unlikely to be caused by MCV.","['Shuda, Masahiro', 'Arora, Reety', 'Kwun, Hyun Jin', 'Feng, Huichen', 'Sarid, Ronit', 'Fernandez-Figueras, Maria-Teresa', 'Tolstov, Yanis', 'Gjoerup, Ole', 'Mansukhani, Mahesh M', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Chaudhary, Preet M', 'Kirkwood, John M', 'Nalesnik, Michael A', 'Kant, Jeffrey A', 'Weiss, Lawrence M', 'Moore, Patrick S', 'Chang, Yuan']","['Shuda M', 'Arora R', 'Kwun HJ', 'Feng H', 'Sarid R', 'Fernandez-Figueras MT', 'Tolstov Y', 'Gjoerup O', 'Mansukhani MM', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Chaudhary PM', 'Kirkwood JM', 'Nalesnik MA', 'Kant JA', 'Weiss LM', 'Moore PS', 'Chang Y']","['Molecular Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA120126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA120726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA120726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/pathology/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*virology', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyomavirus/*pathogenicity', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Skin Neoplasms/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/pathology']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24510 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Sep 15;125(6):1243-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24510.,10.1002/ijc.24510 [doi],PMC6388400,['NIHMS1000583'],,,,,,['2009 UICC'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Repeat collection and bone marrow (BM) harvesting are used in this situation. Minimum cell contents for BM-PBPC combined grafts are undefined. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 19 autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT) with combined BM-PBPC for poor initial PBPC collection was carried out. Mobilization was with filgrastim (10 microg/kg/day) alone for 5 days or after chemotherapy. BM was harvested if PBPC collections were CD34+<2.5 x 10(6)/kg. RESULTS: The median age was 55 years (range 19-74). The diagnoses were multiple myeloma (7), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7), Hodgkin's disease (4) and acute myeloid leukemia (1). The median cell content (CD34+/kg x 10(6)) was 1.1 (0.3-2.7) for BM, 1.2 (0.04-2.8) for PBPC and 2.2 (1.4-4.9) combined. Eight grafts contained <2.0 x 10(6) CD34+/kg (1.4-1.8). The median engraftment in days (range) was: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500, 12 (9-39); Plt > 20 000, 25 (15-70); RBC transfusion independence, 17 (6-93). Six patients died of progressive disease (58-293 days post-ASCT), one of infection on day 141 and one of AML on day 11. All patients except one maintained ANC > 1000 without filgrastim support beyond day 19. One patient had cholecystitis and delayed graft failure on day 90. PBPC CD34+ content did not predict CD34+ BM content but correlated with ANC > 500 (r= - 0.64, P=0.003). BM and combined CD34+ and BM TNC/kg did not correlate with engraftment or outcomes. Combined CD34+/kg < or > = 2.0 x 10(6) produced similar engraftment and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: After a failed PBPC collection, BM harvest is a reliable option for obtaining an adequate combined autograft. Combined BM-PBPC autografts with <2.0x10(6) CD34+/kg can produce satisfactory engraftment.","['Sinitsyn, Yelena', 'Malone, Adriana', 'Mandeli, John', 'Grosskreutz, Celia', 'Osman, Keren', 'Scigliano, Eileen', 'Shi, Patricia', 'Isola, Luis']","['Sinitsyn Y', 'Malone A', 'Mandeli J', 'Grosskreutz C', 'Osman K', 'Scigliano E', 'Shi P', 'Isola L']","['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['912039897 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240902849770 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2009;11(4):457-63. doi: 10.1080/14653240902849770.,10.1080/14653240902849770 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of the present study is to examine the potential of this spectroscopic method for early detection and characterization of premalignant changes. As a model we used both cell lines and primary cells, which were transformed to malignant by retrovirus. Fluorescence measurements and morphological observations of the infected cells were performed at various postinfection times. Our results showed gradual attenuation of fluorescence intensities due to cancer progression which corresponds to aromatic amino acids and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules. In order to obtain grading and supervised classifications of the spectral premalignant changes we used approaches of linear discriminant analysis. The classifications based on Mahalanobis distances allowed us to demonstrate that the accuracy of identification of premalignant stages varied between 83.1% and 96.4%. In summary, we conclude that LIF in tandem with proper statistical tools may be a promising technique for early detection of malignant progression.","['Bogomolny, E', 'Mordechai, Shaul', 'Zwielly, A', 'Huleihel, M']","['Bogomolny E', 'Mordechai S', 'Zwielly A', 'Huleihel M']","['Department of Physics, Ben Gurion University, 84105, Beersheba, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090605,Germany,Eur Biophys J,European biophysics journal : EBJ,8409413,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', '*Light', 'Linear Models', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Time Factors']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00249-009-0488-z [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Biophys J. 2009 Sep;38(7):971-80. doi: 10.1007/s00249-009-0488-z.

The authors examined controls collected by random digit dialing and birth certificates for a Children's Oncology Group case-control study of infant leukemia in 1995-2006. Demographic variables were used to assess differences in RDD and BC controls and their representativeness. RDD and BC controls did not differ significantly with regard to maternal variables (age, race, education, marital status, alcohol during pregnancy) or child variables (sex, gestational age, birth weight), but they varied in smoking during pregnancy (22% RDD controls, 12% BC controls) (P = 0.05).

Further PCR analysis and DNA sequencing with alternative primer sets demonstrated the presence of an e14a3 (also known as b3a3) BCR-ABL fusion.

For this patient, if the qRT-PCR assay had been used to monitor disease response/progression after treatment and not in conjunction with fluorescence in situ hybridization or cytogenetics at the time of diagnosis, the negative result would have been misinterpreted as molecular remission.","['Jinawath, Natini', 'Norris-Kirby, Alexis', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Batista, Denise A', 'Griffin, Constance A', 'Murphy, Kathleen M']","['Jinawath N', 'Norris-Kirby A', 'Smith BD', 'Gocke CD', 'Batista DA', 'Griffin CA', 'Murphy KM']","['Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090604,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60251-6 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2009.090008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2009 Jul;11(4):359-63. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.090008.

However, perturbation of its activity often leads to T cell leukemia. Whether and how its transcriptional activities are regulated during hematopoiesis remains to be addressed. Here, we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs.","['Hu, Xin', 'Li, Xingguo', 'Valverde, Kristell', 'Fu, Xueqi', 'Noguchi, Constance', 'Qiu, Yi', 'Huang, Suming']","['Hu X', 'Li X', 'Valverde K', 'Fu X', 'Noguchi C', 'Qiu Y', 'Huang S']","['Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Anatomy and Cell Biology, Genetics Institute, and Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL091929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL091929/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL090589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090603,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone Demethylases', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/07/18 09:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [medline]']","['0900437106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0900437106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Jun 23;106(25):10141-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0900437106.

BLV is usually present in its host in a transcriptional repressed state but becomes de-repressed a few hours after the infected lymphocytes are cultured in vitro. In the present study we have examined the effect of soluble host factors and various substances on the synthesis of the major BLV protein (p24) in a permanent culture (cell line NBC-10) of neoplastic B-lymphocytes derived from BLV-infected cattle. Certain batches of fetal calf serum (FCS) and bovine platelet lysates (PLy) induced a rapid and drastic increase of the synthesis of BLVp24 in the NBC-10 cells. Neutralization experiments with specific antibodies demonstrated that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was responsible for the stimulatory activity of FCS and PLy on the synthesis of BLVp24 in the NBC-10 cells. Recombinant TGF-beta also stimulated the synthesis of BLVp24 in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from BLV-infected cattle. Mitogens, phorbol-myristate-acetate and prostaglandin E(2), previously shown to stimulate the expression of BLV in cultures of PBMC, did not induce the synthesis of BLVp24 in cultures of NBC-10 cells. Plasma, serum and milk from BLV-negative cattle inhibited the synthesis of BLVp24 induced by FCS, PLy or TGF-beta in the NBC-10 cells. The blocking activity was found in the whey and the beta-casein fractions of bovine milk. The relevance of these findings with regard to the previously reported plasma factor (PBB) with blocking activity on the expression of BLV in short-term PBMC cultures is discussed. Based on the information obtained in the present study we have standardized a reproducible and rapid assay system for the identification of factors that regulate the synthesis of BLVp24 in naturally infected neoplastic B cells.","['Gutierrez, Silvina', 'Ceriani, Carolina', 'Juliarena, Marcela', 'Ferrer, Jorge F']","['Gutierrez S', 'Ceriani C', 'Juliarena M', 'Ferrer JF']","['Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Pcia. de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. segutier@vet.unicen.edu.ar']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090504,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (core protein p24, bovine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Blood Platelets/physiology/virology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*physiopathology/*virology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/physiology/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Milk/physiology/virology', 'Pregnancy', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/physiology', 'Viral Core Proteins/*biosynthesis']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(09)00157-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2009 Oct 15;131(3-4):246-58. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.04.017.

Separase is also overexpressed and mislocalized in a wide range of human cancers, including breast, prostate, and osteosarcoma. Currently, there is no quantitative assay to measure separase enzymatic activity.

Knockdown of the p38alpha and p38beta MAPK isoforms by small interfering RNA (siRNA) are more effective than the p38delta in enhancing PDT-induced cell death. Augmentation of apoptosis by p38alpha or p38beta knockdown is also correlated with the increased proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 after HY-PDT treatment. Our results suggested that HY-PDT activated p38 MAPKs through the production of singlet oxygen. Inhibition of p38 MAPKs with chemical inhibitors or siRNA enhances HY-PDT-induced apoptosis of the HK-1 NPC cells.","['Chan, Pui S', 'Koon, Ho K', 'Wu, Zhen G', 'Wong, Ricky N S', 'Lung, Maria L', 'Chang, Chi K', 'Mak, Nai K']","['Chan PS', 'Koon HK', 'Wu ZG', 'Wong RN', 'Lung ML', 'Chang CK', 'Mak NK']","['Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anthracenes', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Perylene/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Photochemotherapy', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['PHP572 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00572.x [doi]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2009 Sep-Oct;85(5):1207-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00572.x.

Standard therapy with agents such as dacarbazine, temozolomide and IL-2 is associated with notoriously low response rates. The identification of new active agents is, therefore, critical in this disease. In recent years, better understanding of melanoma biology, as well as cancer and immune biology in general has led to the development of a number of new potential therapeutic agents for advanced melanoma. While many of these compounds are being tested in clinical trials, there are more agents in various stages of preclinical development. These novel therapeutics offer hope for this aggressive and so far largely treatment-resistant disease. In this review we will discuss some of the most promising novel therapeutic agents for advanced melanoma.","['Seetharamu, Nagashree', 'Ott, Patrick A', 'Pavlick, Anna C']","['Seetharamu N', 'Ott PA', 'Pavlick AC']","['NYU Cancer Institute, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/06/06 09:00'],"['2009/06/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/era.09.40 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2009 Jun;9(6):839-49. doi: 10.1586/era.09.40.,10.1586/era.09.40 [doi],,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poorer survival has been previously noted in individuals residing in lower socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods. We explored the relationship between SES and survival as modified by age and race/ethnicity using data from the California Cancer Registry. METHODS: A total of 7,688 incident cases of first primary leukemia diagnosed during 1996-2005 in individuals aged 0-39 at diagnosis were included in this study. Univariate analyses of overall survival were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses showed that overall survival and lymphoid cancer-specific survival was reduced in those individuals aged 15-39 compared to children aged 0-14. Although shorter survival was observed in non-whites, an association between lower-SES neighborhood and shorter survival was significant only for non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) (p value for trend <0.05). Lack of insurance was significantly associated with shorter survival for all race/ethnicities examined except Asian/Pacific Islanders (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lower survival in individuals diagnosed with leukemia was observed in adolescents and young adults compared to children and in non-whites compared to NHWs. Further, the independent effects on survival of both low SES and lack of insurance at diagnosis persisted after adjustment for demographic variables and varied across race/ethnicities.","['Kent, Erin E', 'Sender, Leonard S', 'Largent, Joan A', 'Anton-Culver, Hoda']","['Kent EE', 'Sender LS', 'Largent JA', 'Anton-Culver H']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of California, Irvine, 224 Irvine Hall, Irvine, CA 92697-7555, USA. ebardin@uci.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090604,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insurance Coverage/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/ethnology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Class', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/06 09:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9367-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Oct;20(8):1409-20. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9367-2.

Depending on CR, treatment was given for four or six cycles. RESULT: Twenty-six patients were treatment naive and 13 were pre-treated. Twelve patients had progressive Binet stage A, 16 stage B and 11 stage C disease. The overall response rate (ORR) was 100%, with 75% achieving CR. Neutropenia was the major toxicity in 71/187 (38%) of the cycles. There were five deaths, two from infection and three from progressive disease. Twenty-six of 31 patients have maintained their post-treatment disease status for a median of 17 months (2-41).

For example, N-myc is associated with a number of tumors including neuroblastoma, but also plays a central role in the function of normal neural stem and precursor cells (NSC). Both c- and N-myc also enhance the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and are linked to neural tumor stem cells. The mechanisms by which myc regulates normal and neoplastic stem-related functions remain largely open questions. Here from a global, unbiased search for N-Myc bound genes using ChIP-chip assays in neuroblastoma, we found lif as a putative N-Myc bound gene with a number of strong N-Myc binding peaks in the promoter region enriched for E-boxes. Amongst putative N-Myc target genes in expression microarray studies in neuroblastoma we also found lif and three additional important embryonic stem cell (ESC)-related factors that are linked to production of iPSC: klf2, klf4, and lin28b. To examine the regulation of these genes by N-Myc, we measured their expression using neuroblastoma cells that contain a Tet-regulatable N-myc transgene (TET21N) as well as NSC with a nestin-cre driven N-myc knockout. N-myc levels closely correlated with the expression of all of these genes in neuroblastoma and all but lif in NSC. Direct ChIP assays also indicate that N-Myc directly binds the lif promoter. N-Myc regulates trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 in the promoter of lif and possibly in the promoters of several other stem-related genes. Together these findings indicate that N-Myc regulates overlapping stem-related gene expression programs in neuroblastoma and NSC, supporting a novel model by which amplification of the N-myc gene may drive formation of neuroblastoma. They also suggest mechanisms by which Myc proteins more generally contribute to maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of ESC as well as to iPSC formation.","['Cotterman, Rebecca', 'Knoepfler, Paul S']","['Cotterman R', 'Knoepfler PS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Human Anatomy, and Stem Cell Program, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Shriners Hospital For Children Northern California, Sacramento, California, USA.']",['eng'],['K01 CA114400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090604,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KLF2 protein, human)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIN28B protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Methylation', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transgenes']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005799 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Jun 4;4(6):e5799. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005799.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005799 [doi],PMC2686170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased methylation values of the CDKN2A/p16 promoter region were detected in 75% (6/8) PCNSL. Gene expression profiling showed 4/21 (20%) minimal common regions of imbalances to be associated with a differential mRNA expression affecting the FAS, STAT6, CD27, ARHGEF6 and SEPT6 genes.

Here, we studied the biological effects of IL-21 in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). All MCL cell lines and tumors examined expressed the IL-21 receptor. Addition of recombinant IL-21 (rIL-21) in vitro effectively induced STAT1 activation and apoptosis in MCL cells. As STAT1 is known to have tumor-suppressor functions, we hypothesized that STAT1 is important in mediating IL-21-induced apoptosis in MCL cells. In support of this hypothesis, inhibition of STAT1 expression using siRNA significantly decreased the apoptotic responses induced by IL-21. To further investigate the mechanism of IL-21-mediated apoptosis, we employed oligonucleotide arrays to evaluate changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes induced by rIL-21; rIL-21 significantly upregulated three proapoptotic proteins (BIK, NIP3 and HARAKIRI) and downregulated two antiapoptotic proteins (BCL-2 and BCL-XL/S) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Using an ELISA-based assay, we demonstrated that rIL-21 significantly decreased the DNA binding of nuclear factor-kappaB, a transcriptional factor known to be a survival signal for MCL cells. To conclude, IL-21 can effectively induce apoptosis in MCL via a STAT1-dependent pathway. Further understanding of IL-21-mediated apoptosis in MCL may be useful in designing novel therapeutic approaches for this disease.","['Gelebart, P', 'Zak, Z', 'Anand, M', 'Dien-Bard, J', 'Amin, H M', 'Lai, R']","['Gelebart P', 'Zak Z', 'Anand M', 'Dien-Bard J', 'Amin HM', 'Lai R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Cross Cancer Institute and University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 1Z2.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090604,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-21)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-21/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009100 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1836-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.100.

Novel treatment strategies are therefore urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the anti-MM activity of JNJ-26481585, a novel 'second-generation' pyrimidyl-hydroxamic acid-based histone deacetylase inhibitor, using the syngeneic murine 5TMM model of MM. In vitro, JNJ-26481585 induced caspase cascade activation and upregulation of p21, resulting in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the myeloma cells at low nanomolar concentrations. Similar results could be observed in BM endothelial cells using higher concentrations, indicating the selectivity of JNJ-26481585 toward cancer cells. In a prophylactic and therapeutic setting, treatment with JNJ-26481585 resulted in an almost complete reduction of the tumor load and a significant decrease in angiogenesis. 5T2MM-bearing mice also developed a MM-related bone disease, characterized by increased osteoclast number, development of osteolytic lesions and a reduction in cancellous bone. Treatment of these mice with JNJ-264815 significantly reduced the development of bone disease.

The probability of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in PBSCT was much higher in PBSCT (70 +/- 5.4%, extensive 48 +/- 6.5%) than in BMT (25 +/- 4.7%, extensive 10 +/- 3.4%; P < 0.001). Chronic GVHD was associated with long-term impairment of life quality and decreased quality-adjusted survival. In standard-risk leukaemia, use of PBSCT was associated with higher cGVHD, transplant-related mortality and a trend for decreased overall survival. The results suggest that allogeneic PBSCT is associated with high incidence of cGVHD in Chinese patients and its long-term risk and benefit remains to be defined in early stage of leukaemia.","['Tang, J L', 'Yao, M', 'Lu, M Y', 'Ko, B S', 'Lin, D T', 'Lin, K H', 'Chen, Y C']","['Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Lu MY', 'Ko BS', 'Lin DT', 'Lin KH', 'Chen YC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital. tangntuh@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Quality of Life', '*Siblings', 'Survivors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Time', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",2009/06/25 09:00,2009/08/15 09:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 2009 Jun;15(3 Suppl 3):31-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growth in available URD, improved human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing technology and better understanding of HLA matching, the number of URD haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (URD-HSCT) is increasing dramatically in recent years. Peripheral blood stem cells have surpassed bone marrow as the preferred stem cell source for URD-HSCT, and more unrelated cord blood transplantations have been successfully performed in adults. Majority of URD transplants are for haematological malignancies, and acute leukaemia has become the most common disease, while the percentage of older patients receiving URD transplants is increasing. Clinical advances in URD-HSCT have greatly improved the outcomes, which are now comparable to related donor HSCT, however, transplant-related mortality (TRM) remains the most considerable problem in URD-HSCT. It is worth noting that non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have been introduced and utilised increasingly in URD-HSCT recently, which reduce the TRM and expand eligible patients for URD-HSCT. Since the family size is decreasing in China, URD represents the most common alternative source of stem cell for HSCT.

Cord blood transplantation has been successfully performed in paediatric patients with thalassaemia major and with a large body size, and adult patients. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease was relatively low in Taiwan. On the contrary, a relatively higher proportion of hepatitis B carrier in the recipients had led to a higher incidence of reactivation hepatitis, which was markedly decreased following lamivudine prophylaxis. In conclusion, HSCT has become a routine therapy for major medical centres in Taiwan. Our unique experiences in the past decades also contributed to the progress of HSCT.

Since then, the number of BMT has been increasing gradually, especially since the 1990s. Approximately 2000 BMTs per year have been performed in recent years in more than 100 BMT units in mainland China. A recent survey of 12 major BMT units indicates that the predominant types of transplantation performed are identical sibling (38.6%), related mismatched/haploidentical (19.4%), unrelated (17.2%), and autologous (24.5%). The indications of major disease entities are acute myeloid leukaemia (32.8%), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (20%), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) [18.9%], and lymphoid malignancy (13.5%). The number of transplants from unrelated donor or related mismatched/haploidentical donor has been increasing significantly in recent 6 years. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilised bone marrow plus peripheral blood are routinely used as a source of stem cells for haploidentical BMT. Umbilical cord blood is used less often. Although the total number of patients who received allo-BMT continues to increase, the increase in BMT for CML has been flattened since 2004. By the end of 2008, more than 960 000 volunteer's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) data are available in Chinese Marrow Donor Program (CMDP), and more than 1100 stem cell donations have been performed from it. Stem cells for unrelated BMT in mainland China are mainly from Taiwan Tzu Chi Stem Cell Center and CMDP. Related HLA-mismatched/haploidentical BMT has reached fairly good outcomes in terms of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, relapse, treatment-related mortality, disease-free survival, and overall survival, which are comparable with HLA-identical-sibling BMT in the author's BMT units.

This analysis showed that diagnosis and relapsed cases have common genetic alterations, but also that relapsed samples frequently lose chromosomal markers present at diagnosis, suggesting that relapsed T-ALL emerges from an ancestral clone different from the major leukemic population at diagnosis. In addition, we identified deletions and associated mutations in the WT1 tumor suppressor gene in 2 of 9 samples. Subsequent analysis showed WT1 mutations in 28 of 211 (13.2%) of pediatric and 10 of 85 (11.7%) of adult T-ALL cases. WT1 mutations present in T-ALL are predominantly heterozygous frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminal zinc finger domains of this transcription factor. WT1 mutations are most prominently found in T-ALL cases with aberrant rearrangements of the oncogenic TLX1, TLX3, and HOXA transcription factor oncogenes.

Here, we show that dasatinib weakly affects platelet activation by thrombin or adenosine diphosphate but is a potent inhibitor of platelet signaling and functions initiated by collagen or FcgammaRIIA cross-linking, which require immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylation by SFKs. Accordingly, dasatinib treatment rapidly decreases the volume of thrombi formed under arterial flow conditions in whole blood from patients or mice perfused over a matrix of collagen. Moreover, treatment of mice with dasatinib increases the tail bleeding time in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, these effects are rapidly reversible after interruption of the treatment. Our data clearly demonstrate that, in contrast to imatinib, dasatinib affects platelet functions in vitro and in vivo, which has important implications in clinic and could explain increased risks of bleeding observed in patients. Moreover, dasatinib efficiently prevents platelet activation mediated by FcgammaRIIA cross-linking and by sera from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, suggesting that reversible antiplatelet agents acting as ATP-competitive inhibitors of SFKs may be of therapeutic interest in the treatment of this pathology.","['Gratacap, Marie-Pierre', 'Martin, Valerie', 'Valera, Marie-Cecile', 'Allart, Sophie', 'Garcia, Cedric', 'Sie, Pierre', 'Recher, Christian', 'Payrastre, Bernard']","['Gratacap MP', 'Martin V', 'Valera MC', 'Allart S', 'Garcia C', 'Sie P', 'Recher C', 'Payrastre B']","[""Departement d'Oncogenese, Signalisation et Innovation Therapeutique, Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Inserm U563, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090603,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Platelet Activation/*drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37015-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-205328 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 27;114(9):1884-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205328.

Although the post-translational modifications regulating nuclear apoptotic functions of p53 have been thoroughly characterized, little is known of how transcription-independent functions are controlled. We and others identified acetylation of the p53 DNA binding domain at lysine 120 as a critical event in apoptosis induction. Although initial studies showed that Lys-120 acetylation plays a role in p53 function in the nucleus, we report here a role for Lys-120 acetylation in transcription-independent apoptosis. We demonstrate that the Lys-120-acetylated isoform of p53 is enriched at mitochondria. The acetylation of Lys-120 does not appear to regulate the ability of p53 to interact with the pro-apoptotic proteins BCL-XL and BAK. However, displacement of the inhibitory MCL-1 protein from BAK is compromised when Lys-120 acetylation is blocked. Functional studies show that mutation of Lys-120 to a nonacetylated residue, as occurs in human cancer, inhibits transcription-independent apoptosis, and enforced acetylation of Lys-120 enhances transcription-independent apoptosis. These data support a model whereby Lys-120 acetylation contributes to both the transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways induced by p53.","['Sykes, Stephen M', 'Stanek, Timothy J', 'Frank, Amanda', 'Murphy, Maureen E', 'McMahon, Steven B']","['Sykes SM', 'Stanek TJ', 'Frank A', 'Murphy ME', 'McMahon SB']","['Biomedical Graduate Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA090465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090603,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', '*Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(17)49304-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.026096 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Jul 24;284(30):20197-205. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.026096.

However, eradication of disease is almost never attained, because, unlike the vast majority of more differentiated cells, leukemic stem cells withstand TKI's, neccessitating life-long treatment. Besides, although a relatively infrequent event under treatment with TKI's, refractory leukemic stem cells may sometimes give rise to disease transformation. In this article, we will review the definitions of CML stem cells, explain how BCR-ABL induces perturbations of critical signal transduction pathways and summarize specific characteristics that cause refractoriness of CML stem cells against TKI's. Furthermore, events that are responsible or related to transformation of the disease into blast crisis will be discussed and new research directions that should lead to successful ways to attack leukemic stem cells are proposed.","['Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Terwijn, Monique', 'Ossenkoppele, Gerrit J']","['Janssen JJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Terwijn M', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jjwm.janssen@vumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2008/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ABSTRACT # 05 [pii]', '10.2174/157488809789057428 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2009 Sep;4(3):224-36. doi: 10.2174/157488809789057428.,,,,207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It most commonly occurs in association with hematologic malignancies and appears a few hours to a few days after initiation of specific chemotherapy, as the result from the release of intracellular components into the bloodstream due to abrupt malignant cell death. Acute spontaneous TLS is rare, and it has been described in leukemia and lymphoma and in some patients with solid tumors prior to institution of therapy. The syndrome is characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and acute oliguric or anuric renal failure due to uric acid precipitation within the tubules (acute uric acid nephropathy) and to calcium phosphate deposition in the renal parenchyma and vessels.We report a case of acute spontaneous TLS in a patient with Crohn s disease treated with immunosuppressive drugs, who developed a plasmocytoma, in which serum uric acid concentration attained exceptionally high levels (44 mg/dL). The patient underwent acute oliguric renal failure, which required treatment with hyperhydration, urine alkalinization, urate oxidase and hemodialysis, with a fatal evolution.In conclusion, the present case report has several peculiarities: that of being one of the rare examples of spontaneous TLS, that of showing an exceptionally severe hyperuricemia, probably the highest ever reported in the literature, and that of the possible increased risk of tumours in patients with Crohn s disease taking inmunosuppressives and/or TNF antagonists.","['Froilan Torres, C', 'Castro Carbajo, P', 'Pajares Villarroya, R', 'Plaza Santos, R', 'Gomez Senent, S', 'Martin Arranz, M D', 'Adan Merino, L', 'Martin Arranz, E', 'Mancenido Marcos, N', 'Peces, R', 'Benito Lopez, D']","['Froilan Torres C', 'Castro Carbajo P', 'Pajares Villarroya R', 'Plaza Santos R', 'Gomez Senent S', 'Martin Arranz MD', 'Adan Merino L', 'Martin Arranz E', 'Mancenido Marcos N', 'Peces R', 'Benito Lopez D']","['Service of Digestive diseases, University Hospital La Paz and Hospital Infanta Sofia, Madrid, Spain. c_froilantorres@yahoo.es']","['eng', 'spa']",,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Rev Esp Enferm Dig,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,9007566,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Crohn Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/06/05 09:00'],"['2009/06/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Esp Enferm Dig. 2009 Apr;101(4):288-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, OVID, CINAHL, and HealthSTAR databases were searched to identify pertinent articles using the following keywords: gene therapy, XL-SCID, bone marrow transplant, and viral vectors. STUDY SELECTION: Journal articles were selected for their relevance to human gene therapy in patients with XL-SCID. RESULTS: Gene therapy with a retrovirus-derived vector has been used to treat 20 patients with XL-SCID internationally. Although most patients derived improvements in T- and B-cell immune numbers and function, severe adverse effects have occurred. After gene therapy, 5 of the 20 patients developed leukemia. This outcome has been associated with insertion of the corrected gene near the T-cell proto-oncogene LMO2. One of the 5 patients subsequently died. CONCLUSIONS: Within the past decade, effective improvements in vectorology and cell culture conditions have resulted in clinical success in some infants with SCID and have revived interest after many years of setbacks. However, clinical success and significant adverse events have been reported in patients with XL-SCID who have undergone gene therapy using a retroviral vector. As extensive research into improving safety through vector development and monitoring of gene therapy continues, further progress in gene therapy development can be anticipated.","['Rans, Tonya S', 'England, Ronald']","['Rans TS', 'England R']","['Department of Allergy and Immunology, Wilford Hall Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA.

We have previously isolated a panel of spi-1 transgenic erythroleukemic cell lines that proliferated in the presence of either erythropoietin (Epo) or stem cell factor (SCF). Using these cell lines, we observed that EpoR stimulation by Epo down-regulated expression of the SCF receptor Kit and induced expression of the Src kinase Lyn. Furthermore, enforced expression of Lyn in the cell lines increased cell proliferation in response to Epo, but reduced cell growth in response to SCF in accordance with Lyn ability to down-regulate Kit expression. Together, the data suggest that Epo-R/Lyn signaling pathway is essential for extinction of SCF signaling leading the proerythroblast to strict Epo dependency. These results highlight a new role for Lyn as an effector of EpoR in controlling Kit expression. They suggest that Lyn may play a central role in during erythroid differentiation at the switch between proliferation and maturation.","['Kosmider, Olivier', 'Buet, Dorothee', 'Gallais, Isabelle', 'Denis, Nicole', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise']","['Kosmider O', 'Buet D', 'Gallais I', 'Denis N', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","['Inserm U830, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005721 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 May 28;4(5):e5721. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005721.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005721 [doi],PMC2683931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human leukemia cell line K562 as a model of blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia and a set of 18 different flavonoids from four flavonoid subfamilies were used for researching these relationships. Relationships between structure and antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and differentiation activities of flavonoids were estimated by pairwise comparative analysis of selected flavonoids that differ in one structure element. We found that C4 carbonyl and C2-C3 double bonds are critical structure elements for antileukemic activity of flavonoids. We also observed that the ortho-position of hydroxyl groups in the B ring of the flavonoid molecule has an advantage over other variants of B ring hydroxylation patterns. At the same time, flavonoids with a nonhydroxylated B ring were more effective. In the A ring, hydroxylation status of C5 is not critical for antileukemic activity of the flavonoids, whereas the appearance of the hydroxyl group in the C6 position of the flavonoid molecule significantly decreased the IC50 (inhibition concentration required for 50% cytotoxic effect) value. Glycosylation of flavonoids was associated with dramatically decreased activity. These data may help in the rational design of semisynthetic flavonoids with improved antileukemic activity.","['Ramanouskaya, Tanya V', 'Smolnykova, Victoria V', 'Grinev, Vasily V']","['Ramanouskaya TV', 'Smolnykova VV', 'Grinev VV']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biology, Belarusian State University, Minsk 220030, Belarus. romanovskaya.t@mail.ru']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/12 06:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832d684c [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2009 Aug;20(7):573-83. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832d684c.,10.1097/CAD.0b013e32832d684c [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chromosomal translocation t(15;17) results in PML/RARalpha fusion gene, t(8;21) results in AML1/ETO fusion gene and Inv 16 generates CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion gene. Patients with these mutations have a good prognosis unlike abnormalities in chromosome 5 or 7 or FLT3 genes. Therefore, we screened the AmL patients for known specific genetic abnormalities that could lead to more definitive prognoses. METHODS: A total of 113 AML patients were evaluated at diagnosis based on routine morphology and cytochemistry and classified according to the WHO criteria. The distribution of AML subtypes was M1(1), M2(32), M3(57), M4(14), M5(1), M6(1) and seven cases where morphological subtype could not be classified. RT-PCR was performed to identify PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 and FLT3 nternal tandem duplication (ITD). RESULTS: Of the 57 patients with M3 subtype, 55 had the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript. The prevalence of bcr3 (short isoform) was higher (62%) than that of bcr1 (long isoform) (38%) and no correlation was found with age, sex or white blood cell count. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations were more frequent in patients with APL than in other AML subtypes (17.5 vs. 8.9%), the frequency greater in patients with bcr3 isoform (70%) than in those with in bcr1 isoform (30%). Patients with FLT3/ ITD mutations had a significantly higher median white cell count than those without these mutations (55 x 10(9)/l vs. 6.3 x 10(9)/l P<0.001). More patients with FLT3/ITD mutations died early (53%) than those without these mutations (16%) (P<0.01). AML1-ETO fusion transcript was detected in 16 of 56 patients with no correlation with clinical or haematological parameters. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed presence of bcr3 (short isoform) higher than bcr1 (long isoform). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was predominant in acute promyelocytic leukaemia patients with bcr3 isoform. Thus, patients with APL who have FLT3 mutation appear to have a poorer prognosis. Therefore, rapid identification of specific translocations at diagnosis is important for prognostic purposes and their detection should be incorporated into routine assessment.","['Sazawal, Sudha', 'Kumar, Bijender', 'Hasan, Syed Khizer', 'Dutta, Pankhi', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Chaubey, Rekha', 'Mir, Rashid', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Sazawal S', 'Kumar B', 'Hasan SK', 'Dutta P', 'Kumar R', 'Chaubey R', 'Mir R', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2009 Mar;129(3):256-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a key component of BCR signaling, can be blocked by R406, a small-molecule Syk inhibitor, that displayed activity in CLL patients in a first clinical trial. In this study, we investigated the effects of BCR stimulation and R406 on CLL cell survival and migration. The prosurvival effects promoted by anti-IgM stimulation and nurselike cells were abrogated by R406. BCR triggering up-regulated adhesion molecules, and increased CLL cell migration toward the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13. BCR activation also enhanced CLL cell migration beneath marrow stromal cells. These responses were blocked by R406, which furthermore abrogated BCR-dependent secretion of T-cell chemokines (CCL3 and CCL4) by CLL cells. Finally, R406 inhibited constitutive and BCR-induced activation of Syk, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and AKT, and blocked BCR-induced calcium mobilization. These findings suggest that BCR activation favors CLL cell homing, retention, and survival in tissue microenvironments. R406 effectively blocks these BCR-dependent responses in CLL cells, providing an explanation for the activity of R406 in patients with CLL.","['Quiroga, Maite P', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Kurtova, Antonina V', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Quiroga MP', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Kurtova AV', 'Sivina M', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Gandhi V', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

The results demonstrated that administration of engineered DCs that transfected with AdIL-12 after being pulsed with TCL to mice with leukemia had a better protective effect than that of DCs either pulsed with TCL or transfected with AdIL-12. Moreover, depletion of CD8(+) cells in the engineered DCs administered leukemia mice reduced the protective effect.

Results from the in vitro studies indicate that cellular delivery of dasatinib is significantly limited by active efflux due to both P-gp and BCRP. Permeability studies indicated greater permeability in the basolateral-to-apical direction than in the apical-to-basolateral direction due to active efflux by P-gp or BCRP. Selective inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP, such as (R)-4-((1aR,6R,10bS)-1,2-difluoro-1,1a,6,10b-tetrahydrodibenzo-(a,e)cyclopropa(c) cycloheptan-6-yl)-alpha-((5-quinoloyloxy)methyl)-1-piperazineethanol, trihydrochloride (zosuquidar; LY335979) and 3-(6-isobutyl-9-methoxy-1,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12alpha-octahydropyrazino1',2': 1,6pryrido3,4-bindol-3-yl)-propionic acid tert-butyl ester (Ko143), were able to restore the intracellular accumulation and abolish the directionality in net flux of dasatinib. In vivo brain distribution studies showed that the CNS distribution of dasatinib is limited, with the brain-to-plasma concentration ratios less than 0.12 in wild-type mice, which increased approximately 8-fold in Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice. Dasatinib brain distribution was significantly increased in Mdr1a/b(-/-) mice and when wild-type mice were pretreated with LY335979. Simultaneous inhibition of P-gp and BCRP by elacridar [N-(4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)ethyl]-phenyl)-9,10-di hydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridine carboxamide] (GF120918) resulted in a 5-fold increase in brain concentration. These in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that dasatinib is a substrate for the important efflux transporters p-glycoprotein and BCRP. These transport systems play a significant role in limiting the CNS delivery of dasatinib and may have direct implications in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors.","['Chen, Ying', 'Agarwal, Sagar', 'Shaik, Naveed M', 'Chen, Cliff', 'Yang, Zheng', 'Elmquist, William F']","['Chen Y', 'Agarwal S', 'Shaik NM', 'Chen C', 'Yang Z', 'Elmquist WF']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Minnesota, 308 Harvard St. SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090602,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abcg2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Dibenzocycloheptenes)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '813AGY3126 (zosuquidar trihydrochloride)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Acridines/pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacokinetics', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Dasatinib', 'Dibenzocycloheptenes/pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/pharmacokinetics', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacokinetics', 'Vinblastine/pharmacokinetics']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.109.154781 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.109.154781 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 Sep;330(3):956-63. doi: 10.1124/jpet.109.154781.

Its functional integrity can be probed by exposing CLL cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and measuring levels of p53 protein and one of its transcriptional targets, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. We have previously identified two abnormal p53/p21 response patterns associated with inactivating mutations of TP53 and ATM, respectively. Here, we describe a third abnormal response pattern characterized by failure of p21 protein accumulation despite a normal p53 protein response. This so-called ""type C"" response was detected in 10.6% of unselected patients and was associated with resistance of CLL cells to p53-dependent killing by IR, with the clinically more aggressive variant of CLL characterized by unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes and with a single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 31 of the p21 gene in which Ser is replaced by Arg. CLL samples with this allelic variant displayed impaired IR-induced up-regulation of total p21 mRNA and did not express the Arg-encoding transcript, except in those cases harboring an additional single nucleotide polymorphism (T instead of C) in the 3'-untranslated region of the same p21 allele.

Several studies have shown that HQ can form DNA adducts, disrupt microtubule assembly and inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) activity. As these are potential mechanisms underlying endoreduplication (END), a phenomenon that involves DNA amplification without corresponding cell division, we hypothesized that HQ could cause END. We measured END in the human lymphoblastoid cell line, TK6, treated with HQ (0-20 microM) and etoposide (0-0.2 microM) for 48 h. Etoposide was used as a positive control as it is a topo II poison and established human leukemogen that has previously been shown to induce END in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both HQ and etoposide significantly induced END in a dose-dependent manner (P(trend) < 0.0001 and P(trend) = 0.0003, respectively). Since END may underlie the acquisition of high chromosome numbers by tumour cells, it may play a role in inducing genomic instability and subsequent carcinogenesis from HQ and etoposide. In order to further explore the cytogenetic effects of HQ and etoposide, we also examined specific structural changes. HQ did not induce translocations of chromosome 11 [t(11;?)] but significantly induced translocations of chromosome 21 [t(21;?)] and structural chromosome aberrations (SCA) (P(trend) = 0.0415 and P(trend) < 0.0001, respectively). Etoposide potently induced all these structural changes (P(trend) < 0.0001). The lack of an effect of HQ on t(11;?) and the reduced ability of HQ to induce t(21;?) and SCA, compared with etoposide, further suggests that HQ acts primarily as a topo II catalytic inhibitor rather than as a topo II poison in intact human cells.","['Ji, Zhiying', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Guo, Weihong', 'McHale, Cliona M', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Ji Z', 'Zhang L', 'Guo W', 'McHale CM', 'Smith MT']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES006721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090602,England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Metaphase', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['gep018 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/gep018 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2009 Jul;24(4):367-72. doi: 10.1093/mutage/gep018.

Calcium-dependent proteases have been shown previously to process and regulate the activity of specific transcription factors. We show here that the protein levels of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) increase during differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. USF was subject to degradation by the Ca(2+)-dependent protease m-calpain in undifferentiated but not in differentiated MEL cells. Treatment of MEL cells with the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin increased the levels of USF and strongly induced expression of the adult alpha- and beta-globin genes. The induction of globin gene expression was associated with an increase in the association of USF and RNA po ly mer ase II with regulatory elements of the beta-globin gene locus. Calpeptin also induced high level alpha- and beta-globin gene expression in primary CD71-positive erythroid progenitor cells.

In approximately 60% of cases, specific recurrent chromosomal aberrations can be identified by modern cytogenetic techniques. This cytogenetic information is the single most important tool to classify patients at their initial diagnosis into three prognostic categories: favorable, intermediate, and poor risk. Currently, favorable risk AML patients are usually treated with contemporary chemotherapy while poor risk AML patients receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation if suitable stem cell donors exist. The largest subgroup of AML patients (aproximately 40%) have no identifiable cytogenetic abnormalities and are classified as intermediate risk. The optimal therapeutic strategies for these patients are still largely unclear. Recently, it is becoming increasingly evident that it is possible to identify a subgroup of poorer risk patients among those with normal cytogenic AML (NC-AML). Molecular risk stratification for NC-AML patients may be possible due to mutations of NPM1, FLT3, MLL, and CEBPalpha as well as alterations in expression levels of BAALC, MN1, ERG, and AF1q. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm if poorer risk NC-AML patients have improved clinical outcomes after more aggressive therapy.","['Gregory, Tara K', 'Wald, David', 'Chen, Yichu', 'Vermaat, Johanna M', 'Xiong, Yin', 'Tse, William']","['Gregory TK', 'Wald D', 'Chen Y', 'Vermaat JM', 'Xiong Y', 'Tse W']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Cancer Center, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA. tara.gregory@ucdenver.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090602,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Markers/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/physiology']",2009/06/06 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-23 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun 2;2:23. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-23.,10.1186/1756-8722-2-23 [doi],PMC2700131,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the seroprevalence of four herpes viruses [Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and -7] in a cohort of European CLL patients (cohort 1, n = 100) in relation to the immunoglobulin variable heavy (IGHV) chain gene use and compared serological results with those obtained from age- and gender-matched healthy adults (n = 100). RESULTS: CMV-seroprevalence was significantly higher in CLL cohort 1 (79%) than in the control cohort (57%, P = 0.001); the seroprevalence of EBV (89% vs. 94%), HHV-6 (73% vs. 60%), or HHV-7 (35% vs. 35%) was not. In CLL cohort 1, use of IGHV3-30 was more prevalent among CMV-seropositive and of IGHV3-21 among HHV-7-seronegative cases. To investigate the generalizability of these findings, we investigated the herpes virus seroprevalence in a second cohort of age-matched CLL patients from a different geographical area (USA, n = 100, cohort 2). In cohort 2, CMV-seroprevalence was comparable with that of the control cohort (53%). Seroprevalence of EBV, HHV-6 and HHV-7 were 85%, 88% and 73% respectively. In CLL cohort 2, use of IGHV3-30 or IGHV3-21 was not associated with any of the herpes viruses investigated. CONCLUSIONS: CMV-seropositivity is associated with CLL in selected patient cohorts. However, the considerable variation in herpes virus-specific seropositivity between geographically distinct CLL cohorts indicates that seropositivity for any of the four human herpes viruses investigated is not generally associated with CLL.","['Steininger, C', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Vanura, K', 'Eigenberger, K', 'Jager, U', 'Kipps, T J', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Popow-Kraupp, T']","['Steininger C', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Vanura K', 'Eigenberger K', 'Jager U', 'Kipps TJ', 'Mannhalter C', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Popow-Kraupp T']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. christoph.steininger@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['J 2750/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 PO1-CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2009/06/06 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/04 09:00'],"['2009/06/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2131 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02131.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2009 Jun;39(6):497-506. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02131.x.,10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02131.x [doi],PMC3709071,['EMS53772'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: EMS53772'],,

We found a statistically significant difference of vital parameters between protocol A and protocol B, while there were no significant differences between sedation scores and the other parameters evaluated. Patients in protocol A showed a higher incidence of major side effects, such as respiratory depression. Pain neuromediator levels did not show any statistical difference between the two groups.

In 2005, a somatic activating mutation in JAK2 (V617F) was identified in most patients with PV and in about half of patients with ET or PMF. The JAK2 mutation causes the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and leads to autonomous cell growth in a cytokine-independent manner. A higher expression of JAK2 V617F would favor erythrocytosis, and a lower one would favor thrombocytosis. This may suggest that the expression levels of JAK2 V617F directly determine which cell lineages increase, possibly leading to the diversity of myeloproliferative diseases. Although only V617F JAK2 may cause myeloproliferative disease (MPD), clonogenic assay, analysis of familial MPD patients, and examination of JAK2 mutation in acute leukemia patients transformed from MPD show that there are additional somatic mutations which contribute to the pathogenesis of V617F JAK2 positive PV, ET, and PMF.","['Nagata, Kenji', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Nagata K', 'Shimoda K']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Miyazaki University, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Since acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) originates from dysregulated hematopoietic cells, the Notch system may be involved in the abnormal growth. We found that AML cells express not only Notch proteins but also Notch ligand proteins, which suggests the possibility of autonomous Notch activation. It is known that more than half of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases have activating mutations of the NOTCH1 gene. We report that one out of 20 AML samples and none out of 20 MDS samples showed NOTCH1 mutation. We established an AML cell line, TMD7, which proliferates in response to a Notch ligand, Dll1 protein. Notch activation by ligand stimulation suppressed the cytokine-induced differentiation and apoptosis of U937 cells. For OCI/AML-6 and THP1 cells, Notch ligands suppressed the growth and self-renewal capacity while inducing differentiation into macrophage-like cells. For primary AML cells, the Notch ligands exhibited diverse effects on the short-term growth. The ligands reduced the self-renewal capacity and induced differentiation in some samples. For NOTCH1-mutated T ALL cells, gamma-secretase inhibitors(GSI), which block Notch activation, suppress the growth. We found that GSI suppressed the in vitro growth of some B-cell lymphoma and AML cell lines without NOTCH1 mutations through the induction of apoptosis. GSI may be useful as a novel molecular target therapy for various leukemias. For this purpose, we have to clarify the mechanism behind the effects.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and analyzed clinicopathological data on 25 children with BAL, and correlated outcomes with prognostic factors. RESULTS: BAL constituted 4.4% of all acute childhood leukemia cases. In terms of immunophenotype, 14 patients had leukemia with myeloid plus B-lymphoid (M + B) marker, 7 with myeloid plus T-lymphoid (M + T) marker, and 4 with myeloid plus B-lymphoid and T-lymphoid (M + B + T) markers. Overall survival was superior in patients with the M + B immunophenotype (P = 0.004). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) did not improve either overall survival or event-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.35-2.76, P = 0.966; hazard ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.41-2.78, P = 0.88).

Follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are two subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which possess t(14;18) and t(11;14) translocations, respectively. The incidence of FL and MCL is higher in the western countries as compared to India. Interestingly, the associated translocations are also found in healthy individuals in western population, which is 50-80% for t(14;18), whereas t(11;14) occurs at a very low frequency. However, there are no studies to explore these translocations in healthy Indian population, which could explain the lower incidence of FL and MCL. We employed Southern hybridization following nested PCR to detect above translocations in healthy individuals from India. Our results suggest that this assay can detect one t(14;18) translocation event in up to 10(7) normal cells where as one t(11;14) in 10(8) normal cells. According to our results, 87 out of 253 individuals carry t(14;18) indicating 34% prevalence in the population. The presence of this translocation was also detectable at the transcript level. Although, no gender-based difference was observed, an age-dependent increase in the prevalence of translocation was found in adults. However, even after studying 210 people, we could not detect any t(11;14) translocation, indicating that it is uncommon in Indian population. These results suggest that lower incidence of FL and MCL in India could be attributed to lower prevalence of these translocations in healthy individuals.","['Nambiar, Mridula', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Nambiar M', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090602,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage/genetics', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/epidemiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/epidemiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/03 09:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0755-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Jan;89(1):35-43. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0755-1.

LGL-leukaemia is usually of the T-cell type, but a minority displays an NK-cell phenotype. Incidence and prevalence are unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified patients with LGL-leukaemia (with well-defined diagnostic criteria) diagnosed at Rikshospitalet University Hospital between 01.10.2001 and 31.12.2007. Their medical records were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS: LGL-leukaemia was diagnosed in 52 patients, 26 women and 26 men, median age of 59 (26 - 86) years, during the study period. The leukaemia displayed NK-cell phenotype in one patient and T-cell phenotype in the remaining 51 patients. Slightly more than one third of the patients were asymptomatic. Cytopenia, mostly neutropenia, was usually the cause of the clinical phenotype in symptomatic patients. Co-morbidity with autoimmune disease was common, and we also found a high prevalence of clonal B-cell disease (17 %). INTERPRETATION: Our data support the notion that LGL-leukaemia is under-diagnosed. Unexplained cytopenias should suggest the possibility of LGL-leukaemia, and appropriate diagnostic measures should be undertaken. An early diagnosis may save patients an extensive and unnecessary diagnostic work-up and ensure that a simple and effective treatment is offered.","['Michalsen, Silje', 'Schrumpf, Elisabeth', 'Beiske, Klaus', 'Tierens, Anne', 'Stenberg, Vigdis', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E']","['Michalsen S', 'Schrumpf E', 'Beiske K', 'Tierens A', 'Stenberg V', 'Tjonnfjord GE']","['Det medisinske fakultet, Universitetet i Oslo.']",['nor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/06/03 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['1840018 [pii]', '10.4045/tidsskr.09.0152 [doi]']",ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2009 May 28;129(11):1098-102. doi: 10.4045/tidsskr.09.0152.,10.4045/tidsskr.09.0152 [doi],,,,"['Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2009 Aug 27;129(16):1660; author reply 1660.

In recent years, our understanding of the biological basis of CLL pathogenesis has substantially improved and novel treatment strategies are emerging. Tailoring and individualizing therapy according to the molecular and cellular biology of the disease is on the horizon, and advances with targeted agents such as monoclonal antibodies combined with traditional chemotherapy have lead to improved remission rates. The proposed key role of the B-cell receptor (BCR) in CLL pathogenesis has led to a number of possible opportunities for therapeutic exploitation. We are beginning to understand that the microenvironment is of utmost importance in CLL because certain T-cell subsets and stromal cells support the outgrowth and development of the malignant clone. Furthermore, an increase in our understanding of the deregulated cell-death machinery in CLL is a prerequisite to developing new targeted strategies that might be more effective in engaging with the cell-death machinery. This Review summarizes the progress made in understanding these features of CLL biology and describes novel treatment strategies that have also been exploited in current clinical trials.","['Pleyer, Lisa', 'Egle, Alexander', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Greil, Richard']","['Pleyer L', 'Egle A', 'Hartmann TN', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research and IIIrd Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090602,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

TRF1 knockout embryos suffer from severe growth defects without apparent telomere dysfunction, suggesting an obligatory role for TRF1 in cell cycle control. To date, the mechanism regulating the mitotic increase in TRF1 protein expression and its function in mitosis remains unclear. Here, we identify guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3 (GNL3L), a GTP-binding protein most similar to nucleostemin, as a novel TRF1-interacting protein in vivo. GNL3L binds TRF1 in the nucleoplasm and is capable of promoting the homodimerization and telomeric association of TRF1, preventing promyelocytic leukemia body recruitment of telomere-bound TRF1, and stabilizing TRF1 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitylation and binding to FBX4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for TRF1. Most importantly, the TRF1 protein-stabilizing activity of GNL3L mediates the mitotic increase of TRF1 protein and promotes the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. This work reveals novel aspects of TRF1 modulation by GNL3L.","['Zhu, Qubo', 'Meng, Lingjun', 'Hsu, Joseph K', 'Lin, Tao', 'Teishima, Jun', 'Tsai, Robert Y L']","['Zhu Q', 'Meng L', 'Hsu JK', 'Lin T', 'Teishima J', 'Tsai RY']","['Center for Cancer and Stem Cell Biology, Alkek Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University System Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA113750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113750-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (Fbx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (GNL3L protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Tinf2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Tert protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity', 'Dimerization', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Spindle Apparatus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Ubiquitination']",2009/06/03 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']","['jcb.200812121 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200812121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2009 Jun 1;185(5):827-39. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200812121.,10.1083/jcb.200812121 [doi],PMC2711588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib, a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC-family kinases, has efficacy in patients with CML-AP who have experienced treatment failure with imatinib. We now report follow-up data from the full patient cohort of 174 patients enrolled onto a phase II trial to provide a more complete assessment of the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with imatinib-resistant (n = 161) or -intolerant (n = 13) CML-AP received dasatinib 70 mg orally twice daily. Results At a median follow-up of 14.1 months (treatment duration, 0.1 to 21.7 months), major and complete hematologic responses were attained by 64% and 45% of patients, respectively, and major and complete cytogenetic responses were achieved in 39% and 32% of patients, respectively. Responses were achieved irrespective of imatinib status (resistant or intolerant), prior stem-cell transplantation, or the presence of prior BCR-ABL mutation. The 12-month progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 66% and 82%, respectively. Dasatinib was generally well tolerated; the most frequent nonhematologic severe treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (52%; grade 3 to 4, 8%). Cytopenias were common, including grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (76%) and thrombocytopenia (82%). Pleural effusion occurred in 27% of patients (grade 3 to 4, 5%).

Patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are frequently monitored for response by QPCR studies for minimal molecular disease. The clinical significance of increasing levels of QPCR in patients in CGCR is uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients in durable CGCR, and on imatinib therapy for at least 18 months, had increases in QPCR levels (documented at least twice consecutively) as defined by literature reports. These were further analyzed by the achievement of major molecular response (MMR) defined as QPCR < or = 0.05%, as well as by the degree of increase in QPCR. RESULTS: Only 11 (9.5%) of 116 patients with increases in QPCR had CML progression; 10 of them were among 44 patients (23%) who either lost a MMR or never had a MMR, and had more than 1 log increase of QPCR. CONCLUSION: Most patients with increases in QPCR remain in CGCR.

These mutations not only result in a loss of wild-type p53 activity, but can also lead to a gain of new oncogenic properties. Understanding how these gained functions are regulated is in its infancy. In this study, we show that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is an important regulator of mutant p53. We show that PML interacts with mutant p53. Importantly, PML enhances the transcriptional activity of mutant p53. Unexpectedly, PML is required for the proliferation and colony formation of cancer cells bearing mutant p53. Down-regulation of PML expression inhibits the growth of mutant p53-expressing cancer cells, predominantly by promoting cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the tumor suppression function of PML depends on the status of p53. In the context of mutant p53, PML enhances its cancer-promoting activities.","['Haupt, Sue', 'di Agostino, Silvia', 'Mizrahi, Inbal', 'Alsheich-Bartok, Osnat', 'Voorhoeve, Mathijs', 'Damalas, Alex', 'Blandino, Giovanni', 'Haupt, Ygal']","['Haupt S', 'di Agostino S', 'Mizrahi I', 'Alsheich-Bartok O', 'Voorhoeve M', 'Damalas A', 'Blandino G', 'Haupt Y']","['Research Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

LMO2 functions in transcription complexes via protein-protein interactions involving two LIM domains and causes a preleukemic T-cell development blockade followed by clonal tumors. Therefore, LMO2 is necessary but not sufficient for overt neoplasias, which must undergo additional mutations before frank malignancy. An open question is the importance of LMO2 in tumor development as opposed to sustaining cancer. We have addressed this using a peptide aptamer that binds to the second LIM domain of the LMO2 protein and disrupts its function. This specificity is mediated by a conserved Cys-Cys motif, which is similar to the zinc-binding LIM domains. The peptide inhibits Lmo2 function in a mouse T-cell tumor transplantation assay by preventing Lmo2-dependent T-cell neoplasia. Lmo2 is, therefore, required for sustained T-cell tumor growth, in addition to its preleukemic effect. Interference with LMO2 complexes is a strategy for controlling LMO2-mediated cancers, and the finger structure of LMO2 is an explicit focus for drug development.","['Appert, Alex', 'Nam, Chang-Hoon', 'Lobato, Natividad', 'Priego, Eva', 'Miguel, Ricardo Nunez', 'Blundell, Tom', 'Drynan, Lesley', 'Sewell, Helen', 'Tanaka, Tomoyuki', 'Rabbitts, Terence']","['Appert A', 'Nam CH', 'Lobato N', 'Priego E', 'Miguel RN', 'Blundell T', 'Drynan L', 'Sewell H', 'Tanaka T', 'Rabbitts T']","[""Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['G0600914/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105178807/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Aptamers, Peptide)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aptamers, Peptide/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",2009/06/03 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['69/11/4784 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4774 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;69(11):4784-90. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4774.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4774 [doi],PMC2690635,['UKMS4469'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: UKMS4469'],,

Agents that inhibit these enzymes may provide novel agents for either the chemoprevention or treatment of diverse malignancies. Recently, jasmonates, a family of plant stress hormones that bear a structural resemblance to prostaglandins, have been shown to elicit anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we show that jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJ) are capable of inhibiting all four human AKR1C isoforms. Although JA is the more potent inhibitor of recombinant AKR1C proteins, including the in vitro prostaglandin F synthase activity of AKR1C3, MeJ displayed greater potency in cellular systems that was, at least in part, due to increased cellular uptake of MeJ. Moreover, using the acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines HL-60 and KG1a, we found that although both jasmonates were able to induce high levels of reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent fashion, only MeJ was able to induce high levels of mitochondrial superoxide (MSO), possibly as an epiphenomenon of mitochondrial damage. There was a strong correlation observed between MSO formation at 24 hours and reduced cellularity at day 5. In conclusion, we have identified AKR1C isoforms as a novel target of jasmonates in cancer cells and provide further evidence of the promise of these compounds, or derivatives thereof, as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of cancer.","['Davies, Nicholas J', 'Hayden, Rachel E', 'Simpson, Paul J', 'Birtwistle, Jane', 'Mayer, Katarina', 'Ride, Jonathan P', 'Bunce, Chris M']","['Davies NJ', 'Hayden RE', 'Simpson PJ', 'Birtwistle J', 'Mayer K', 'Ride JP', 'Bunce CM']","['College of Life and Environmental Sciences, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6RI5N05OWW (jasmonic acid)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (3 alpha-beta, 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.188 (prostaglandin-F synthase)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Acetates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxylipins/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/06/03 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['69/11/4769 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4533 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;69(11):4769-75. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4533.,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4533 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ERG is known to have a crucial role in establishing definitive hematopoiesis and is required for normal megakaryopoiesis. Truncated forms of ERG are associated with multiple cancers such as Ewing's sarcoma, prostate cancer, and leukemia as part of oncogenic fusion translocations. Increased expression of ERG is highly indicative of poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia and ERG is expressed in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL); however, it is unclear if expression of ERG per se has a leukemogenic activity. We show that ectopic expression of ERG in fetal hematopoietic progenitors promotes megakaryopoiesis and that ERG alone acts as a potent oncogene in vivo leading to rapid onset of leukemia in mice. We observe that the endogenous ERG is required for the proliferation and maintenance of AMKL cell lines. ERG also strongly cooperates with the GATA1s mutated protein, found in Down syndrome AMKL, to immortalize megakaryocyte progenitors, suggesting that the additional copy of ERG in trisomy 21 may have a role in Down syndrome AMKL.

It is known that genotoxic agents can increase the frequency of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can initiate DNA recombinational repair mechanisms. In this study we investigated the induction of micronuclei, the formation of gamma-H2A.X as a marker of DNA DSBs, and the induction of somatic DNA recombination events in hematopoietic tissue from pKZ1 transgenic mice exposed acutely or in utero to benzene. Adult male C57Bl/6N mice were treated with a single i.p. injection of benzene, and timed-pregnant females pKZ1 were treated with daily i.p. injections of 200 mg/kg or 400 mg/kg benzene through gestational days 7-15. Acute exposure to 400 mg/kg benzene resulted in a statistically significant increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells in adult male bone marrow cells and in fetal liver and post-natal day 9 bone marrow cells of mice exposed in utero. Immunoblotting techniques did not detect benzene-induced increases in the formation of gamma-H2A.X in bone marrow cells of adult male mice and in maternal bone marrow, fetal liver, and post-natal bone marrow cells after specific time-point exposures. Finally, no recombination events were detected in adult pKZ1 mouse tissue; however, in post-natal day 9 pups in utero exposure to 400 mg/kg of benzene caused a trend towards increasing recombination frequency although this did not reach statistical significance. These results demonstrate that in utero exposure increases the frequency of micronuclei and DNA recombination events in hematopoietic tissue of fetal and post-natal mice and may be an initiating event in the etiology of childhood leukemias. Further investigations into different types of DNA damage and repair pathways are warranted to fully elucidate the role of genotoxic mechanisms in the etiology of benzene-induced childhood leukemias.","['Lau, Annette', 'Belanger, Christine Lea', 'Winn, Louise M']","['Lau A', 'Belanger CL', 'Winn LM']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, K7L3N6.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090410,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/chemically induced', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy']",2009/06/03 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2008/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(09)00149-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 May 31;676(1-2):74-82. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2009.04.001.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is commonest in children, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is more frequent in adults. Apart from childhood ALL, the prognosis of acute leukemia is suboptimal, with many patients experiencing relapse, which carries a poor prognosis, or toxicities from nonspecific therapies. Recent years have witnessed great interest in the application of high-resolution, genome wide approaches to the study of acute leukemia. These studies have identified multiple novel genetic alterations targeting critical cellular pathways that contribute to leukemogenesis, including alterations of genes regulating lymphoid development, tumor suppressors, apoptosis regulators, and oncogenes. These studies have also delineated novel genetic alterations that are associated with prognosis, and have demonstrated substantial evolution in patterns of genetic alterations from diagnosis to relapse, indicating that specific genetic changes determine resistance to therapy in ALL. Overall, fewer recurring alterations have been identified in AML. These studies have demonstrated the power of genome-wide approaches to identify new lesions in acute leukemia, and suggest that ongoing genomic analyses, including deep resequencing and epigenetic analysis, will continue to yield novel, clinically relevant insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.","['Mullighan, C G']",['Mullighan CG'],"[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. charles.mullighan@stjude.org""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090518,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Gene Dosage/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2009/06/03 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1167 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01167.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Aug;31(4):384-97. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01167.x.

However, this may be obscured by the significant morbidity and mortality due to other complications of haematological malignancies, such as bleeding and infections. The vast majority of patients with haematological neoplasias also have clinically silent haemostatic abnormalities, but some may show clinical manifestations, including venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation and life-threatening thrombohaemorrhagic syndrome in acute leukaemias. The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease in haematological malignancies is complex and multifactorial: tumour cell-derived procoagulant, fibrinolytic or proteolytic factors and inflammatory cytokines affect clotting activation, and chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs increase thrombotic risk in patients with lymphoma, acute leukaemia and multiple myeloma. Infectious complications are another important factor: endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria induce the release of tissue factor (TF), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and gram-positive organisms can release bacterial mucopolysaccharides that directly activate factor XII. Leukaemic patients may be affected by other prothrombotic factors, including hyperleukocytosis, increased TF expression and activation, and the prothrombotic properties of therapeutic agents such as all-trans retinoic acid and L-asparaginase, which can induce thrombosis involving multiple organs. The very high risk of haemorrhaging in these patients warrants prospective randomised trials evaluating optimal anti-thrombotic prophylaxis and treatment.","['Castelli, Roberto', 'Ferrari, Barbara', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Guariglia, Achille']","['Castelli R', 'Ferrari B', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Guariglia A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Milan, Via Pace 9, 20122 Milan, Italy. rcastelli@policlinico.mi.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Vasc Pharmacol,Current vascular pharmacology,101157208,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Hemorheology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Leukocytosis/physiopathology', 'Paraproteinemias/complications/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Pulmonary Embolism/drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Thromboembolism/*drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Thrombotic Microangiopathies/etiology/metabolism']",2009/06/03 09:00,2010/08/26 06:00,['2009/06/03 09:00'],"['2010/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['CVP-Abs-039 [pii]', '10.2174/157016110791330799 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Vasc Pharmacol. 2010 Jul;8(4):482-94. doi: 10.2174/157016110791330799.,,,,148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When these complaints predominate in the clinical presentation, they lead the diagnosis towards nonmalignant conditions, that are most common cause of such symptoms in children, like injuries, nonspecific reactive arthritis or inflammatory connective tissue diseases. However, in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the most prevalent childhood malignancy, bone and joint pains are present early in 40-60% of cases and they frequently anticipate any abnormalities in complete blood counts. Findings reported in the literature and own observations indicate that these complaints correlate with: lower white cell counts, lower percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood and lower incidence of organomegaly - that may delay the decision of bone marrow aspiration.

METHODS: MTT assay was used to investigate reversal index of resveratrol to vincristine, adriamycin and paclitaxel. Cell apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of multidrug resistant 1 (MDR1) and B cell lymphoma leukemia-2 (Bcl-2). RESULTS: Resveratrol produced a synergistic effect with chemotherapeutics and obviously reversed the multidrug resistant phenotype of KBv200 cells. The reversal fold (RF) of 200 micromol/L resveratrol to vincristine, paclitaxel and adriamycin were 77.1, 61.3 and 5.9, respectively. The gene array results showed that resveratrol greatly downregulated expression levels of Bcl-2 and MDR1. After treated with 100 micromol/L, 200 micromol/L resveratrol, the expression level of Bcl-2 and MDR1 in KBv200 cells were markedly decreased in comparison with those untreated (t were 2.98, 3.51 and 3.12, 4.56, P < 0.05).

Single nucleotide polymorphism array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of the breakpoint region in three ATLL-related cell lines and four patient samples revealed that the chromosomal breakpoints are localized within the enhancer of polycomb 1 (EPC1) gene locus in an ATLL-derived cell line (SO4) and in one patient with acute-type ATLL. EPC1 is a human homologue of the E(Pc) enhancer of polycomb gene of Drosophila. Inappropriate expression of the polycomb group gene family has been linked to the loss of normal gene silencing pathways, which can contribute to the loss of cell identity and malignant transformation in many kinds of cancers. In the case of the SO4 cell line, which carried a der(10)t(2;10)(p23;p11.2) translocation, EPC1 was fused with the additional sex combs-like 2 (ASXL2) gene at 2p23.3 (EPC1/ASXL2). In the case with an acute-type ATLL, who carried a der(10)del(10)(p11.2)del(10)(q22q24) translocation, a putative truncated EPC1 gene (EPC1tr) was identified. Overexpression of EPC1/ASXL2 enhanced cell growth in T-leukemia cells, and a GAL4-EPC1/ASXL2 fusion protein showed high transcriptional activity. Although a GAL4-EPC1tr fusion protein did not activate transcription, overexpression of EPC1tr accelerated cell growth in leukemia cells, suggesting that the EPC1 structural abnormalities in the SO4 cell line and in the patient with acute-type ATLL may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Nakahata, Shingo', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Hamasaki, Makoto', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Arai, Yasuhito', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Nakahata S', 'Saito Y', 'Hamasaki M', 'Hidaka T', 'Arai Y', 'Taki T', 'Taniwaki M', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (ASXL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (EPC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/10/03 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20681 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Sep;48(9):768-76. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20681.,10.1002/gcc.20681 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Fifty-six children treated for ALL and 56 healthy controls were examined for dental anomalies, and data on decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) score, visible plaque (VPI), and gingival bleeding (GBI) indices, and saliva flow were collected. Mean age of all children treated for ALL was 5.3 +/- 2.6 years at diagnosis and 11.8 +/- 4.2 at evaluation. Thirty-two were males. RESULTS: Forty-five treated children (80.4%) had at least one dental anomaly, and patients treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and bone marrow transplantation had the greatest mean number of dental anomalies (15.37 +/- 15.03). Patients younger than 5 years at beginning of treatment were also more affected (P = 0.031). Children treated for ALL had a DMFT score of 1.9 +/- 4.0, GBI of 26.5%, VPI of 72.0%, and mean saliva flow of 0.19 ml/min; healthy children had a DMFT score of 1.52 +/- 3.5, GBI of 11.1%, VPI of 53.8%, and mean saliva flow of 0.27 ml/min. CONCLUSION: The treatment of ALL causes a significant increase in the number of dental anomalies. Their GBI and VPI were also elevated. Changes in salivary glands during treatment did not affect saliva flow permanently. Follow-up of these patients by an oral health team is recommended.","['Maciel, Julio Cesar Cordova', 'de Castro, Claudio Galvao Jr', 'Brunetto, Algemir Lunardi', 'Di Leone, Luciane Pons', 'da Silveira, Heloisa Emilia Dias']","['Maciel JC', 'de Castro CG Jr', 'Brunetto AL', 'Di Leone LP', 'da Silveira HE']","['School of Dentistry, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil. jcmaciel@hcpa.ufrgs.br']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Dental Plaque/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gingival Hemorrhage/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', '*Oral Health', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Tooth Abnormalities/*epidemiology']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22108 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Sep;53(3):361-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22108.,10.1002/pbc.22108 [doi],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-seven AML patients were treated with HAD regimen containing intermediate dose cytarabine (IDAra-C) as induction therapy, 83 from which with karyotype results were divided into three cytogenetic groups according to SWOG criteria. Complete remission (CR) rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) among different groups were evaluated. The CR rate of the 87 cases was 80/87 (92%). Median DFS and OS have not reached (NR). DFS rates at 1 and 3 years were 76.3% and 63.4%, respectively. OS rates at 1 and 3 years were 86.0% and 58.7%, respectively. According to SWOG criteria, CR rate, median DFS, and OS were 100%, NR and NR for the favorable group; 88.9%, NR, and 16 months for the intermediate group; 83.3%, 4.5 months, and 7.5 months for the adverse group. The differences among the three groups were statistically significant excepting for CR rate between adverse and intermediate groups. HAD regimen containing IDAra-C as induction chemotherapy regimen is effective in de novo AML of adult patients and can achieve higher CR rate and longer survival than standard dose of cytarabine (SDAra-C) regimen. Most of the patients were able to endure the therapy. Cytogenetics is still an important prognostic factor despite of the incorporation of IDAra-C in induction chemotherapy.

Double strand breaks (DSBs) triggering 9p21 deletions in ALL have been reported to occur at a few defined sites by illegitimate action of the V(D)J recombination activating protein complex. We have cloned 23 breakpoint junctions for a total of 46 breakpoints in 17 childhood ALL (9 B- and 8 T-lineages) showing different size deletions at one or both homologous chromosomes 9 to investigate which particular sequences make the region susceptible to interstitial deletion. We found that half of 9p21 deletion breakpoints were mediated by ectopic V(D)J recombination mechanisms whereas the remaining half were associated to repeated sequences, including some with potential for non-B DNA structure formation. Other mechanisms, such as microhomology-mediated repair, that are common in other cancers, play only a very minor role in ALL. Nucleotide insertions at breakpoint junctions and microinversions flanking the breakpoints have been detected at 20/23 and 2/23 breakpoint junctions, respectively, both in the presence of recombination signal sequence (RSS)-like sequences and of other unspecific sequences. The majority of breakpoints were unique except for two cases, both T-ALL, showing identical deletions. Four of the 46 breakpoints coincide with those reported in other cases, thus confirming the presence of recurrent deletion hotspots. Among the six cases with heterozygous 9p deletions, we found that the remaining CDKN2A and CDKN2B alleles were hypermethylated at CpG islands.","['Novara, Francesca', 'Beri, Silvana', 'Bernardo, Maria Ester', 'Bellazzi, Riccardo', 'Malovini, Alberto', 'Ciccone, Roberto', 'Cometa, Angela Maria', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Giorda, Roberto', 'Zuffardi, Orsetta']","['Novara F', 'Beri S', 'Bernardo ME', 'Bellazzi R', 'Malovini A', 'Ciccone R', 'Cometa AM', 'Locatelli F', 'Giorda R', 'Zuffardi O']","['Biologia Generale e Genetica Medica, Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Via Forlanini, 14, 27100 Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090530,Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00439-009-0689-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 2009 Oct;126(4):511-20. doi: 10.1007/s00439-009-0689-7.

Little is known about the level of expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins and of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in KS tumour cells relative to HHV8 expression. We therefore investigated the expression of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1) of HHV8, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax, Bcl-xL, caspase 3 and HIF-1alphain KS tissue specimens at different stages of the disease. The expression of these proteins was evaluated immunohistochemically using tissue microarrays (TMAs) in tissue specimens from 245 HIV-positive patients at different stages of the disease. Both LANA-1 and HIF-1alpha were expressed in KS biopsies taken at different stages, but their level increased throughout tumour progression. Additionally, the levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were higher in visceral KS lesions compared to levels observed in cutaneous and mucosal KS. This study demonstrates that late tumour stages of KS in tissues from HIV-positive patients are associated with high levels of LANA-1, HIF-1alpha and of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Finally, the expression of these proteins can be potentially used as a tissue biomarker in defining patients with a higher risk of disease progression.","['Long, E', 'Ilie, M', 'Hofman, V', 'Havet, K', 'Selva, E', 'Butori, C', 'Lacour, J P', 'Nelson, A M', 'Cathomas, G', 'Hofman, P']","['Long E', 'Ilie M', 'Hofman V', 'Havet K', 'Selva E', 'Butori C', 'Lacour JP', 'Nelson AM', 'Cathomas G', 'Hofman P']","['Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Louis Pasteur Hospital, Nice 06002, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090530,Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (latency-associated nuclear antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Viral/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/virology']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00428-009-0791-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2009 Aug;455(2):159-70. doi: 10.1007/s00428-009-0791-1.

However, these MiHA-specific CD8+ T-cell responses do not result in complete eradication of tumor cells in all patients. Furthermore, CD8+ memory T cells persisting after DLI do not always efficiently expand with recurrence of the disease. Adjuvant immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with hematopoietic-restricted MiHA may boost antitumor CD8+ T-cell immunity without inducing graft-versus-host disease. Here, we explored the use of mRNA-electroporated DC to stimulate MiHA-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. We demonstrate that electroporation of mature DC with P2X5 mRNA encoding for hematopoietic-restricted MiHA LRH-1 results in high expression of both mRNA and protein, and has no negative effect on the mature phenotype and migratory capacity of the DC. Furthermore, these DC can efficiently stimulate LRH-1-specific CD8+ effector T cells to proliferate and produce interferon-gamma. In addition, LRH-1-specific CD8+ memory T cells that are present in patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells at long periods post-DLI can be effectively activated by stimulation with P2X5 mRNA-electroporated DC to proliferate and degranulate upon target cell recognition. These results indicate that adjuvant immunotherapy using DC electroporated with mRNA encoding hematopoietic-restricted MiHA mismatched between patients and donors may enhance the graft versus tumor response induced by stem cell transplantation and DLI.","['Overes, Ingrid M', 'Fredrix, Hanny', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'van der Voort, Robbert', 'de Witte, Theo M', 'Dolstra, Harry']","['Overes IM', 'Fredrix H', 'Kester MG', 'Falkenburg JH', 'van der Voort R', 'de Witte TM', 'Dolstra H']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC), Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (P2RX5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X5)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'Electroporation', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X5', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/10/06 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181987c22 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Jul-Aug;32(6):539-51. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181987c22.,10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181987c22 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cancer registry and medical records of all cancer patients for over a 10-year period in a medical center of Japan were reviewed. We examined the intervals of symptom onset to clinical presentation and the presence of metastasis at diagnosis. RESULTS: In 3,893 cancer patients, the mean interval of symptom onset to clinical presentation was 89 days (median, 30 days). The cancer group with a short interval of only days to weeks included hepatobiliary, ovary, brain, and acute leukemia. The group with a long interval of months to years included head and neck, thyroid, and skin cancers. Other types of cancer were included in the middle group with an interval of weeks to months. Among patients with head & neck, skin, and ovarian cancers, the longer interval was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of distant metastasis. A longer interval with an increment of each month was associated with a lower likelihood for distant metastasis with an odds ratio of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99). CONCLUSION: Hepatobiliary, ovary, brain, and acute leukemia are among the cancer types with an interval of days to weeks, while head and neck, thyroid, and skin cancers are among the types with an interval of months to years. Among patients with solid tumors, those with metastasis are likely to present to a physician more promptly.","['Tokuda, Yasuharu', 'Chinen, Katsuya', 'Obara, Haruo', 'Joishy, Suresh K']","['Tokuda Y', 'Chinen K', 'Obara H', 'Joishy SK']","[""Center for Clinical Epidemiology, St Luke's Life Science Institute, Tokyo. tokuyasu@orange.ocn.ne.jp""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090601,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2009/06/02 09:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/48.1720 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.48.1720 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2009;48(11):899-905. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.48.1720.

RT-PCR and methylation-PCR (MSP) were used to detect the mRNA expression and promoter methylation of GLIPR1, respectively, and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: The level of GLIPR1 mRNA in the AML cell lines was lower than that in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and ALL cell lines, whereas the methylation level of GLIPR1 in the former was higher than that in the latter. The level of GLIPR1 mRNA in the AML cell lines was significantly increased, but had no obvious changes in the CML and ALL cell lines after 5-aza-2dC treatment.

There was a negative correlation between the mRNA level and methylation status of GLIPR1 in the AML bone marrows.

The classical detection methods such as multiparameter flow cytometry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis are expensive, time-consuming and complex, and require considerable technical expertise. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 229 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to the GBTLI-99 protocol at three different Brazilian centers. Minimal residual disease was analyzed in bone marrow samples at diagnosis and on days 14 and 28 by conventional homo/heteroduplex polymerase chain reaction using a simplified approach with consensus primers for IG and TCR gene rearrangements. RESULTS: At least one marker was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 96.4% of the patients. By combining the minimal residual disease results obtained on days 14 and 28, three different prognostic groups were identified: minimal residual disease negative on days 14 and 28, positive on day 14/negative on day 28, and positive on both. Five-year event-free survival rates were 85%, 75.6%, and 27.8%, respectively (p<0.0001). The same pattern of stratification held true for the group of intensively treated children. When analyzed in other subgroups of patients such as those at standard and high risk at diagnosis, those with positive B-derived CD10, patients positive for the TEL/AML1 transcript, and patients in morphological remission on a day 28 marrow, the event-free survival rate was found to be significantly lower in patients with positive minimal residual disease on day 28. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the detection of minimal residual disease on day 28 is the most significant prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: This simplified strategy for detection of minimal residual disease was feasible, reproducible, cheaper and simpler when compared with other methods, and allowed powerful discrimination between children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a good and poor outcome.","['Scrideli, Carlos A', 'Assumpcao, Juliana G', 'Ganazza, Monica A', 'Araujo, Marcela', 'Toledo, Silvia R', 'Lee, Maria Lucia M', 'Delbuono, Elisabete', 'Petrilli, Antonio S', 'Queiroz, Rosane P', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Viana, Marcos B', 'Yunes, Jose A', 'Brandalise, Silvia R', 'Tone, Luiz G']","['Scrideli CA', 'Assumpcao JG', 'Ganazza MA', 'Araujo M', 'Toledo SR', 'Lee ML', 'Delbuono E', 'Petrilli AS', 'Queiroz RP', 'Biondi A', 'Viana MB', 'Yunes JA', 'Brandalise SR', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. scrideli@fmrp.usp.br']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['94/6/781 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.003137 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Jun;94(6):781-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.003137.,10.3324/haematol.2008.003137 [doi],PMC2688569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results revealed that RGZ (>40 mmol/L) inhibits the growth of K562 cells and causes apoptosis in a time and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis is observed clearly by Hoechst 33258 staining. Western blotting analysis demonstrates the cleavage of caspase-3 zymogen protein with the appearance of its 17-kD subunit and a dose-dependent cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Furthermore, RGZ treatment down-regulates anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulates pro-apoptotic protein Bax in a dosedependent manner after the cells are treated for 48 hours. Telomerase activity is decreased concurrently in a dosedependent manner. We therefore conclude that RGZ induces apoptosis in K562 cells in vitro, and that RGZ-induced apoptosis in K562 cells is highly correlated with activation of caspase-3, decreasing telomerase activity, down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.","['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Hu, Ting', 'Wu, Xiang-Yuan', 'Wang, Chun-Zhi', 'Xu, Yan', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Xiao, Ruo-Zhi', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Huang, Ren-Wei', 'Liu, Qiang']","['Liu JJ', 'Hu T', 'Wu XY', 'Wang CZ', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Xiao RZ', 'Lin DJ', 'Huang RW', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510630, P R China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Toxicol,International journal of toxicology,9708436,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bisbenzimidazole/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/analysis']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']","['28/2/123 [pii]', '10.1177/1091581809335312 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Toxicol. 2009 Mar-Apr;28(2):123-31. doi: 10.1177/1091581809335312.,10.1177/1091581809335312 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During infection, the host-pathogen interplay is characterized by very dynamic kinetics resulting in equilibrium between the virus, which attempts to proliferate, and the immune response, which seeks to exert tight control of the virus. A major determinant of disease induction by both viruses is the accumulation of provirus in peripheral blood. In the absence of viral proteins, virus infected cells escape recognition and destruction by the host immune response. We propose a novel therapeutic strategy based on transient activation of viral expression using epigenetic modulators; this exposes infected cells to the immune response and results in significant reductions in proviral loads. In the absence of satisfactory therapies, this viral gene-activation strategy might delay progression, or even be curative, for HTLV-1 induced myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).","['Lezin, Agnes', 'Olindo, Stephane', 'Belrose, Gildas', 'Signate, Aissatou', 'Cesaire, Raymond', 'Smadja, Didier', 'Macallan, Derek', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Bangham, Charles', 'Bouzar, Amel', 'Gillet, Nicolas', 'Defoiche, Julien', 'Florins, Arnaud', 'Verlaeten, Olivier', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Willems, Luc']","['Lezin A', 'Olindo S', 'Belrose G', 'Signate A', 'Cesaire R', 'Smadja D', 'Macallan D', 'Asquith B', 'Bangham C', 'Bouzar A', 'Gillet N', 'Defoiche J', 'Florins A', 'Verlaeten O', 'Burny A', 'Willems L']","['Laboratory of Virology-Immunology, Neurology and JE 2503, University Hospital of Fort-de-France, 97200 Fort-de-France, Martinique, France.']",['eng'],['G0601072/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090601,Singapore,Front Biosci (Schol Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Scholar edition),101485241,,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', '*Models, Biological', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/genetics/*therapy', 'Sheep']",2009/06/02 09:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['20 [pii]', '10.2741/S20 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Schol Ed). 2009 Jun 1;1:205-15. doi: 10.2741/S20.,,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, Tax provides infected T-cells with a growth advantage and with the potential to get transformed through the deregulation of cell-cycle progression and the acquisition of genetic alterations. Considering that leukemias are induced by disturbances in hematopoietic cells development, we hypothesize that the expression of Tax in human immature thymocytes is a prerequisite to the emergence of ATL cells. Studies of alph abeta T-cell development in the thymus have shown that beta-selection, an early important checkpoint, is regulated by transcription factors that are decisive in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Interestingly, Tax is endowed with the ability to interfere with the activity of these transcription factors. We therefore propose that the HTLV-1 infection of these specific target thymocytes leads to a transcriptional deregulation of early alphabeta T cell development, thus inducing a pre-leukemogenic event that favours the subsequent proliferation of ATL cells.","['Wencker, Melanie', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine']","['Wencker M', 'Gazzolo L', 'Duc Dodon M']","['Virologie Humaine, INSERM -U758, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090601,Singapore,Front Biosci (Schol Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Scholar edition),101485241,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",2009/06/02 09:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['19 [pii]', '10.2741/S19 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Schol Ed). 2009 Jun 1;1:194-204. doi: 10.2741/S19.,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discuss recent evidence from sheep studies in the context of the growing knowledge that has accumulated in the field of epigenetics in human cancer. These results support the hypothesis that epigenetic events, which were initially identified as a causative mechanism of virus silencing, are also major players in host gene regulation.

The case for a JAK2-type mutation as a prequel to the connective tissue disorders.,651-4,"The JAK2 [V617F] mutation has recently been recognised as critical to the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). Thus, a common mutation affecting a haematopoietic precursor stem cell is capable of giving rise to diverse clinical phenotypes. In this hypothesis paper, we propose that a similar mutation affecting a stem cell precursor, most likely of the B cell lineage, could underlie the development of the connective tissue disorders which could be regarded as ""lymphoproliferative"" disorders. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that there are similarities between the myeloproliferative disorders and the connective tissue disorders in terms of their biological behaviour. Diseases within each family can transform into each other and sometimes into haematological malignancies (most often B cell origin non-Hodgkins lymphoma for the connective tissue disorders and acute myeloid leukemia for the myeloproliferative disorders). The timecourse for development of the connective tissue disorders involves a long latent period when autoantibodies are present (anti-CCP and ANA) possibly reflecting production by a B cell clone. A similar time-dependent increase in clonal dominance has been described in erythroblastic clones taken from the bone marrow of polycythemia vera patients, long before the onset of clinical disease. Evidence of B cell clonality has been described in bone marrow samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and from glandular biopsies from those with Sjogren's syndrome. Moreover, pseudofollicles containing activated B cells are features of rheumatoid synovial membrane and have also recently been described in subchondral bone where they are associated with macrophages, T cells and osteoclasts. The success of B cell depletion therapy in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus is also strong circumstantial evidence for this hypothesis.","['McQueen, Fiona M', 'Dalbeth, Nicola']","['McQueen FM', 'Dalbeth N']","['Dept. of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, 85 Park Rd., Grafton, Auckland, New Zealand. f.mcqueen@auckland.ac.nz']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090530,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Connective Tissue Diseases/enzymology/*genetics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Mutation']",2009/06/02 09:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(09)00315-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2009.03.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2009 Nov;73(5):651-4. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.03.050.

Extensive studies have indicated that ROS are involved in 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis. Herein, we provide further evidence that the Akt signaling pathway is involved in 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis. Of note is the fact that the expression of PI3K (p110) does not change obviously, and neither LY294002 nor insulin could influence the apoptosis induced by 4-HPR. These observations implicate the direct interaction between Akt and ROS. Our data also reveal that 4-HPR-mediated ROS evoke Akt conformational change by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond; N-acetylcysteine and glutathione, as thiol antioxidants, significantly abate the ROS generation in 4-HPR-exposed cells. Further experiments indicate that the conformational change in Akt not only disrupts Akt-Hsp90 binding, but also enhances Akt-PP2A interaction. All these results collectively suggest that 4-HPR-induced apoptosis is associated with a ROS-mediated conformational change in Akt, and this change, as a consequence, mediates dephosphorylation of Akt via regulating Akt-Hsp90 or Akt-PP2A complex formation.","['Cao, Ji', 'Xu, Danqing', 'Wang, Duoduo', 'Wu, Rui', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhu, Hong', 'He, Qiaojun', 'Yang, Bo']","['Cao J', 'Xu D', 'Wang D', 'Wu R', 'Zhang L', 'Zhu H', 'He Q', 'Yang B']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*pharmacology', 'Serine/metabolism']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(09)00317-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2009 Sep 1;47(5):536-47. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.05.024.

However, all studies so far analyzed the stoichiometry of the CNTF receptor complex in vitro and not in the context of living cells. We generated and expressed in mammalian cells acyl carrier protein-tagged versions of both CNTF and CNTFR. After labeling CNTF and CNTFR with different dyes we analyzed their diffusion behavior at the cell surface. Fluorescence (cross) correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) measurements reveal that CNTFR diffuses with a diffusion constant of about 2 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) independent of whether CNTF is bound or not. FCS and FCCS measurements detect the formation of receptor complexes containing at least two CNTFs and CNTFRs. In addition, we measured Forster-type fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two differently labeled CNTFs within a receptor complex indicating a distance of 5-7 nm between the two. These findings are not consistent with a tetrameric structure of the CNTFR complex suggesting that either hexamers and or even higher-order structures (e.g. an octamer containing two tetramers) are formed.","['Neugart, Felix', 'Zappe, Andrea', 'Buk, Deborah M', 'Ziegler, Inna', 'Steinert, Steffen', 'Schumacher, Monika', 'Schopf, Eva', 'Bessey, Ralph', 'Wurster, Kathrin', 'Tietz, Carsten', 'Borsch, Michael', 'Wrachtrup, Jorg', 'Graeve, Lutz']","['Neugart F', 'Zappe A', 'Buk DM', 'Ziegler I', 'Steinert S', 'Schumacher M', 'Schopf E', 'Bessey R', 'Wurster K', 'Tietz C', 'Borsch M', 'Wrachtrup J', 'Graeve L']","['Institut fur Biologische Chemie und Ernahrungswissenschaft, Universitat Hohenheim, Emil-Wolff-Str. 14, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090529,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Chemical', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/10/20 06:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0005-2736(09)00168-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2009.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009 Sep;1788(9):1890-900. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamem.2009.05.013.

In this study, we elucidated the apoptotic mechanisms of DMPS action on a human leukemia cell line using functional pharmacologic and genetic approaches. First, we demonstrated that DMPS-induced apoptosis is evidenced by nuclear morphological change, distinct internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and an increased sub-G1 cell population. DMPS treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, accompanied by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and led to cytochrome c release, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family. Ectopic expression of bcl-2 and bcl-xL conferred resistance of HL-60 cells to DMPS-induced cell death, suggesting that DMPS-induced apoptosis occurs predominantly through the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. We also observed that DMPS activated the caspase-8-Bid-Bax pathway and that the inhibition of caspase-8 by z-IETD-fmk or small interfering RNA suppressed the cleavage of Bid, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptotic cell death. In addition, cells subjected to DMPS exhibited significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and ROS scavengers, such as quercetin and Tiron, but not N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited DMPS-induced activations of caspase-8, -3 and subsequent apoptotic cell death, indicating the role of ROS in caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that caspase-8 acts upstream of caspase-3, and that the caspase-8-mediated mitochondrial pathway is important in DMPS-induced apoptosis. Our results also suggest that ROS are critical regulators of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in DMPS-treated leukemia cells.","['Kim, Byeong Mo', 'Choi, Yun Jung', 'Han, Youngsoo', 'Yun, Yeon-Sook', 'Hong, Sung Hee']","['Kim BM', 'Choi YJ', 'Han Y', 'Yun YS', 'Hong SH']","['Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Gongneung-Dong, Nowon-Gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (N,N-dimethylphytosphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/08/12 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(09)00219-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.05.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2009 Aug 15;239(1):87-97. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.05.020.

Because of the symmetric distal involvement and vesiculobullous nature of the skin lesions, the differential diagnosis included erythema multiforme and vasculitis. However, a skin biopsy specimen revealed infiltration with a striking predominance of blast cells in the dermis. These cells were also observed within the walls of the venules along with fibrin. Leukemia cutis associated with vasculitis was diagnosed. A few blast cells can be observed in many reactive dermatoses in patients with leukemia.

The human DPY-30-like protein (DPY-30L) homolog is a conserved member of certain histone methyltransferase (HMT) complexes. In the human MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukemia-1) HMT complex, DPY-30L binds to the BRE2 homolog ASH2L in order to regulate histone 3-lysine 4 trimethylation. We have determined the 1.2-A crystal structure of the human DPY-30L C-terminal domain (DPY-30L(C)). The DPY-30L(C) structure, harboring the conserved DPY-30 motif, is composed of two alpha-helices linked by a sharp loop and forms a typical X-type four-helix bundle required for dimer formation. DPY-30L(C) dimer formation is largely mediated by an extensive hydrophobic interface with some additional polar interactions. The oligomerization of DPY-30L(C) in solution, together with its reported binding to ASH2L, leads us to propose that the hydrophobic surface of the dimer may provide a platform for interaction with ASH2L in the MLL1 HMT complex.","['Wang, Xianping', 'Lou, Zhiyong', 'Dong, Xiuhua', 'Yang, Wen', 'Peng, Yong', 'Yin, Bin', 'Gong, Yanhua', 'Yuan, Jiangang', 'Zhou, Weihong', 'Bartlam, Mark', 'Peng, Xiaozhong', 'Rao, Zihe']","['Wang X', 'Lou Z', 'Dong X', 'Yang W', 'Peng Y', 'Yin B', 'Gong Y', 'Yuan J', 'Zhou W', 'Bartlam M', 'Peng X', 'Rao Z']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090527,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DPY30 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry', '*Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(09)00643-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2009.05.061 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2009 Jul 17;390(3):530-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.05.061.

Bz-423 modulates the F(1)F(0)-ATPase, inducing the formation of superoxide within the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which then functions as a second messenger initiating apoptosis. In order to understand some of the features that contribute to the increased sensitivity of lymphocytes, we report the signaling pathway engaged by Bz-423 in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Ramos). Following the generation of superoxide, Bz-423-induced apoptosis requires the activation of Bax and Bak to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Knockdown of the BH3-only proteins Bad, Bim, Bik, and Puma inhibits Bz-423 apoptosis, suggesting that these proteins serve as upstream sensors of the oxidant stress induced by Bz-423. Treatment with Bz-423 results in superoxide-dependent Mcl-1 degradation, implicating this protein as the link between Bz-423-induced superoxide and Bax and Bak activation. In contrast to fibroblasts, B cell death induced by Bz-423 is independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These results demonstrate that superoxide generated from the mitochondrial respiratory chain as a consequence of a respiratory transition can signal a specific apoptotic response that differs across cell types.","['Blatt, Neal B', 'Boitano, Anthony E', 'Lyssiotis, Costas A', 'Opipari, Anthony W Jr', 'Glick, Gary D']","['Blatt NB', 'Boitano AE', 'Lyssiotis CA', 'Opipari AW Jr', 'Glick GD']","['Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, F6865 Mott SPC 5297, 1500 E.

ABCD guidelines on prevention and management.,565-74,"OVERVIEW: Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that may induce depression of the immune system, anaemia and/or lymphoma. Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of FeLV infection has decreased considerably, thanks both to reliable tests for the identification of viraemic carriers and to effective vaccines. INFECTION: Transmission between cats occurs mainly through friendly contacts, but also through biting. In large groups of non-vaccinated cats, around 30-40% will develop persistent viraemia, 30-40% show transient viraemia and 20-30% seroconvert. Young kittens are especially susceptible to FeLV infection. DISEASE SIGNS: The most common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia are immune suppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Less common signs are immune-mediated disease, chronic enteritis, reproductive disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Most persistently viraemic cats die within 2-3 years. DIAGNOSIS: In low-prevalence areas there may be a risk of false-positive results; a doubtful positive test result in a healthy cat should therefore be confirmed, preferably by PCR for provirus. Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats should be retested. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: Supportive therapy and good nursing care are required. Secondary infections should be treated promptly. Cats infected with FeLV should remain indoors. Vaccination against common pathogens should be maintained. Inactivated vaccines are recommended. The virus does not survive for long outside the host. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS: All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure should be vaccinated against FeLV. Kittens should be vaccinated at 8-9 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later. The ABCD suggests that, in cats older than 3-4 years of age, a booster every 2-3 years suffices, in view of the significantly lower susceptibility of older cats.","['Lutz, Hans', 'Addie, Diane', 'Belak, Sandor', 'Boucraut-Baralon, Corine', 'Egberink, Herman', 'Frymus, Tadeusz', 'Gruffydd-Jones, Tim', 'Hartmann, Katrin', 'Hosie, Margaret J', 'Lloret, Albert', 'Marsilio, Fulvio', 'Pennisi, Maria Grazia', 'Radford, Alan D', 'Thiry, Etienne', 'Truyen, Uwe', 'Horzinek, Marian C']","['Lutz H', 'Addie D', 'Belak S', 'Boucraut-Baralon C', 'Egberink H', 'Frymus T', 'Gruffydd-Jones T', 'Hartmann K', 'Hosie MJ', 'Lloret A', 'Marsilio F', 'Pennisi MG', 'Radford AD', 'Thiry E', 'Truyen U', 'Horzinek MC']",['European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD). hlutz@vetclinics.uzh.ch'],['eng'],"['BB/D008425/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0300387/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Leukemia, Feline/diagnosis/*prevention & control/therapy/transmission', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Societies', 'United States', 'Vaccination/*veterinary', 'Veterinary Medicine/*standards', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Viremia/veterinary']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S1098-612X(09)00117-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2009 Jul;11(7):565-74. doi: 10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.005.,10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.005 [doi],PMC7172531,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the second biopsy the hsr and MLL amplification appears as nonreciprocal translocation of multiple copies in the form of marked amplification of MLL on chromosome 16 in a background of increasing chromosomal aberrations. This case suggests that either the MLL amplification and translocation alone or in conjunction with other flanking oncogenes may have played an important role in poor patient outcome.","['Maitta, Robert W', 'Cannizzaro, Linda A', 'Ramesh, K H']","['Maitta RW', 'Cannizzaro LA', 'Ramesh KH']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Cytogenetics, Montefiore Medical Center of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)'],IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",2009/06/02 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/06/02 09:00'],"['2008/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00136-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.02.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Jul;192(1):40-3. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.02.018.,10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.02.018 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Th1 lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages (MM) likely induce lesion formation, whereas Th2 lymphocytes may inhibit formation. To explore the role of cytokines in MS lesions, we used gene arrays to investigate effects of cytokines representative of Th1 and Th2 cells and M/M on gene expression in cultured CNS glia; at 6 hr, all three increased expression of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene and decreased expression of the leptin receptor gene (obr), which mediates IL-6 production and other inflammatory responses. However, expression of a closely related gene, the interleukin-6 signal transducer or gp130 (IL-6st), showed no changes at 6 hr. IL-6st is an essential component of receptor complexes for IL-6 and other cytokines and growth factors that play critical roles in CNS inflammation, protection, and/or regeneration. To analyze expression of IL-6st and leptin receptor over time, we incubated rat CNS glial cultures for 6 hr to 5 days with the cytokines. All three cytokine mixtures down-regulated both IL-6st and leptin receptor mRNA and protein for up to 5 days. Immunocytochemical staining showed expression of both IL-6st and leptin receptor in all three types of glia, with lower IL-6st expression by 3 days. Down-regulation of IL-6st and leptin receptor in glia by cytokines could lead to decreased signaling by the proinflammatory IL-6 and reduced responses to regenerative/protective growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor, potentially affecting the disease course in MS.","['Rose, Jason J', 'Bealmear, Beverly', 'Nedelkoska, Liljana', 'Studzinski, Diane', 'Lisak, Robert P', 'Benjamins, Joyce A']","['Rose JJ', 'Bealmear B', 'Nedelkoska L', 'Studzinski D', 'Lisak RP', 'Benjamins JA']","['Department of Neurology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/immunology/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Neuroglia/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Leptin/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.22135 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2009 Nov 1;87(14):3098-106. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22135.,10.1002/jnr.22135 [doi],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We determined ZAP-70 expression in 1,229 patients with CLL using the SBZAP clone by applying three different ways of analysis (% positive B-cells, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in B-cells, MFI ratio T-cells:B-cells). RESULTS: ZAP-70 expression was related to somatic hypermutation status of IgVH genes for all three ways of analysis (P < 0.0001 each). The strongest correlation was found for MFI ratio (r = -0.475, P < 0.0001); cases with mutated and unmutated IgVH status significantly differed in their mean MFI ratio (6.33 vs. 3.34, P < 0.0001). ZAP-70 expression was weaker in sole del(13q) (5.44 vs. 4.44, P = 0.001) and stronger in del(11q) (3.31 vs. 5.29, P < 0.0001) and del(6q) (3.29 vs. 5.18, P = 0.005). MFI ratio was significantly related to time to therapy (P = 0.004, RR = 0.79) in 221 evaluable cases. Multivariate analysis proved MFI ratio (P = 0.043, RR = 0.64) and CD38 (P = 0.047, RR = 1.20 per 10%) as only parameters independently related to time to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of ZAP-70 expression using SBZAP and applying MFI ratio T-cells:B-cells results in significant relations to IgVH mutation status, cytogenetics, and outcome and should be further analyzed and considered for routine application in CLL.","['Kern, Wolfgang', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kern W', 'Dicker F', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. wolfgang.kern@mll-online.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In this overview, inspired by the lectures and the discussions among participants, we summarize current knowledge on exposure to EMF and disease risk, with emphasis on studies of use of mobile phones and brain tumours and exposure to power lines and childhood leukaemia. Sources of bias and error hamper straightforward conclusions in some areas and, in order to move forward, improvements in study design and exposure assessment are necessary. The scientific evidence available to date on possible long-term effects from exposure to ELF and RF fields is not strong enough to revise current protection limits based on the known acute effects of such exposures. Precautionary measures may be considered to reduce ELF exposure of children or exposure to RF during mobile phone use, keeping in mind that it is unclear whether they involve any preventive benefit. Possible health effects from mobile phone use in adults and in children should be investigated further by prospective epidemiological studies with improved exposure assessment and brain tumour incidence rates should be monitored. Further studies on the relation between childhood leukaemia and ELF magnetic fields would be worthwhile if they focus on heavily exposed groups and attempt to minimize possible selection bias.

Recently, norzoanthamine derivatives were demonstrated to inhibit strongly the growth of P-388 murine leukemia cell lines, in addition to their potent antiplatelet activities on human platelet aggregation. Their distinctive biological properties, combined with novel chemical structures, make this family of alkaloids extremely attractive targets for chemical synthesis.

The purpose of this study was to first characterise the activities of a novel PBOX analogue, PBOX-16 and then investigate the anti-angiogenic potential of both PBOX-16 and its prototype PBOX-6. METHODS: The effects of PBOX-6 and -16 on cancerous cells (chronic myeloid leukaemia K562 cells and ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells) and primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined by assessing cell proliferation, microtubular organisation, DNA analysis of cell cycle progression and caspase-3/7 activity. Their anti-angiogenic properties were then investigated by examining their ability to interfere with HUVEC differentiation into capillary-like structures and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated HUVEC migration. RESULTS: PBOX-6 and -16 inhibited proliferation of K562, A2780 and HUVEC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. PBOX-16, confirmed as a novel depolymerising agent, was approximately tenfold more potent than PBOX-6. Inhibition of cell proliferation was mediated by G(2)/M arrest followed by varying degrees of apoptosis depending on the cell type; endothelial cells underwent less apoptosis than either of the cancer cell lines. In addition to the antitumourigenic properties, we also describe a novel antiangiogenic function for PBOXs: treatment with PBOXs inhibited the spontaneous differentiation of HUVECs into capillary-like structures when grown on a basement membrane matrix preparation (Matrigel) and also significantly reduced VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration. CONCLUSION: Dual targeting of both the tumour cells and the host endothelial cells by PBOX compounds might enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of these drugs.","['Nathwani, Seema-Maria', 'Butler, Stephen', 'Meegan, Mary J', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Nathwani SM', 'Butler S', 'Meegan MJ', 'Campiani G', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. nathwans@tcd.ie']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0', '(4-((N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)oxy)-5-(naphth-1-yl)naphtho(2,3-b)pyrrolo(1,2-d)(1,4)o', 'xazepine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzazepines)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzazepines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carbamates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Oxazepines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology']",2009/05/30 09:00,2011/05/10 06:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1033-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Jan;65(2):289-300. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1033-6.,10.1007/s00280-009-1033-6 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signaling pathways leading to apoptotic PMN death are classified in two categories: the intrinsic and the extrinsic. In the present study the expressions of proteins participating in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (DR5, FADD, caspase-8 activity) and the intensity of apoptosis of PMNs from patients with cancer of the oral cavity were examined. The expression of proteins participating in the intrinsic pathway (Bax and Mcl-1) were also examined in these cells. The results can be helpful in explaining the reasons for the decreased activity of these cells in oral cavity cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The examinations were carried out in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity before and after treatment. The expressions of all the proteins were measured in neutrophils and, for comparison, in autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Western blot analysis was used to assay the expressions of DR5, FADD, Bax, and Mcl-1 in cell lysates. The apoptosis level was determined by flow cytometry and caspase-8 activity by colorimetric assay. RESULTS: A lack of changes in DR5 expression associated with increased FADD protein expression and caspase-8 activity accompanied the accelerated apoptosis rates in the PMNs of the patients before treatment. Decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein was associated with an unchanged expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein. There were no such changes in the patients PBMCs. Increased expression of Mcl-1 in the PMNs of the patients following surgical treatment was found. CONCLUSION: The acceleration of the apoptosis of PMNs of oral cavity cancer patients before treatment is dependent on both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.","['Jablonska, Ewa', 'Garley, Marzena', 'Jablonski, Jakub']","['Jablonska E', 'Garley M', 'Jablonski J']","['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland. ewaj@amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090529,Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/surgery', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology/surgery', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00005-009-0023-z [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2009 May-Jun;57(3):229-34. doi: 10.1007/s00005-009-0023-z.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for phosphoantigen-mediated activation of human gammadelta T-cells remain unclear. In particular, previous reports have described a very slow kinetics of activation of T-cell receptor (TCR)-associated signal transduction pathways by isopentenyl pyrophosphate and bromohydrin pyrophosphate, seemingly incompatible with direct binding of these antigens to the Vgamma9Vdelta2 TCR. Here we have studied the most potent natural phosphoantigen yet identified, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMB-PP), produced by Eubacteria and Protozoa, and examined its gammadelta T-cell activation and anti-tumor properties. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have performed a comparative study between HMB-PP and the anti-CD3epsilon monoclonal antibody OKT3, used as a reference inducer of bona fide TCR signaling, and followed multiple cellular and molecular gammadelta T-cell activation events. We show that HMB-PP activates MEK/Erk and PI-3K/Akt pathways as rapidly as OKT3, and induces an almost identical transcriptional profile in Vgamma9(+) T-cells. Moreover, MEK/Erk and PI-3K/Akt activities are indispensable for the cellular effects of HMB-PP, including gammadelta T-cell activation, proliferation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity, which are also abolished upon antibody blockade of the Vgamma9(+) TCR Surprisingly, HMB-PP treatment does not induce down-modulation of surface TCR levels, and thereby sustains gammadelta T-cell activation upon re-stimulation. This ultimately translates in potent human gammadelta T-cell anti-tumor function both in vitro and in vivo upon transplantation of human leukemia cells into lymphopenic mice, CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The development of efficient cancer immunotherapy strategies critically depends on our capacity to maximize anti-tumor effector T-cell responses. By characterizing the intracellular mechanisms of HMB-PP-mediated activation of the highly cytotoxic Vgamma9(+) T-cell subset, our data strongly support the usage of this microbial antigen in novel cancer clinical trials.","['Correia, Daniel V', ""d'Orey, Francisco"", 'Cardoso, Bruno A', 'Lanca, Telma', 'Grosso, Ana R', 'deBarros, Ana', 'Martins, Leila R', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Silva-Santos, Bruno']","['Correia DV', ""d'Orey F"", 'Cardoso BA', 'Lanca T', 'Grosso AR', 'deBarros A', 'Martins LR', 'Barata JT', 'Silva-Santos B']","['Molecular Immunology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090521,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl pyrophosphate)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Diphosphates)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Diphosphates/immunology', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Molecular Mimicry/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005657 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 May 21;4(5):e5657. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005657.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005657 [doi],PMC2682580,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTAP and CDKN2A are homozygously co-deleted, with a frequency of 35 to 70%, in lung and pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, mesothelioma, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In normal cells, but not in tumor cells lacking MTAP, MTAP cleaves the natural substrate, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P), which are then converted to adenine nucleotides and methionine. This distinct difference between normal MTAP-positive cells and tumor MTAP-negative cells led to several proposals for therapy. We offer a novel strategy in which both MTA and a toxic adenine analog, such as 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), 6-methylpurine (MeP), or 2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade), are administered. In MTAP-positive cells, abundant adenine, generated from supplied MTA, competitively blocks the conversion of an analog, by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), to its active nucleotide form. In MTAP-negative tumor cells, the supplied MTA cannot generate adenine; hence conversion of the analog is not blocked. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that this combination treatment--adenine analog plus MTA--kills MTAP-negative A549 lung tumor cells, while MTAP-positive human fibroblasts (HF) are protected. In co-cultures of the breast tumor cell line, MCF-7, and HF cells, MCF-7 is inhibited or killed, while HF cells proliferate robustly. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG) may also be used with our strategy. Though neither analog is activated by APRT, in MTAP-positive cells, adenine produced from supplied MTA blocks conversion of 5-FU and 6-TG to their toxic nucleotide forms by competing for 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The combination of MTA with 5-FU or 6-TG, in the treatment of MTAP-negative tumors, may produce a significantly improved therapeutic index. CONCLUSION: We describe a selective strategy to kill tumor cells lacking MTAP.","['Lubin, Martin', 'Lubin, Adam']","['Lubin M', 'Lubin A']","['Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America. martin.lubin@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090529,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', ""4754-39-6 (5'-deoxyadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005735 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 May 29;4(5):e5735. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005735.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005735 [doi],PMC2684647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2010;5(4). doi: 10.1371/annotation/54fad81d-c975-4b30-bb2b-249650ec3d66'],,,

RESULTS: The mean pretreatment proportion of p89 PARP-positive cells was 3.5%. Six and twelf hours after prednisone administration it increased significantly (p<0.01) only in the group of good treatment responders. A significant rise (p<0.05) in cytoplasmic Bax expression was seen in the good responders as early as 6 hours after prednisone administration followed by a significant rise in Bax nuclear expression after 12 hours. At the same time points the mean percentage of apoptotic cells as well as Bax expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus remained unchanged in the group of poor responders.

Despite extensive study, the mechanism by which SP600125 inhibits mitosis-related effects in human leukemia cells remains unclear. We investigated the effects of SP600125 on the inhibition of cell proliferation and the cell cycle, and on microtubule dynamics in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of synchronized leukemia cells with varying concentrations of SP600125 results in significant G2/M cell cycle arrest with elevated p21 levels, phosphorylation of histone H3 within 24 h, and endoreduplication with elevated Cdk2 protein levels after 48 h. SP600125 also induces significant abnormal microtubule dynamics in vivo. High concentrations of SP600125 (200 microM) were required to disorganize microtubule polymerization in vitro. Additionally, SP600125- induced delayed apoptosis and cell death was accompanied by significant poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and caspase-3 activity in the late phase (at 72 h). Endoreduplication showed a greater increase in ectopic Bcl-2-expressing U937 cells at 72 h than in wild-type U937 cells without delayed apoptosis.

However, it is difficult to discriminate leukemic invasion into the lung from infectious pulmonary complications. The serum level of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), which is a mucin-like glycoprotein, is increased in more than 70% of patients with interstitial pneumonia. Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is produced mainly in the lung by alveolar type II and bronchiolar epithelial cells and is a useful serum marker for interstitial pneumonia. We therefore measured the levels of KL-6 and SP-D in sera from 128 patients (76 males and 52 females, mean age: 59 years) with hematological malignancies, including adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Overall, the increase in KL-6 or SP-D, above each cut-off value (500 U/ml for KL-6 and 110 ng/ml for SP-D), was detected in 11 patients (8.6%) or 10 patients (7.8%), respectively. In contrast, among 67 ATL patients, 15 patients had high serum levels of KL-6 and/or SP-D; both were elevated in 2 patients, only KL-6 was elevated in 6 patients and only SP-D was elevated in 7 patients. Thus, serum KL-6 and SP-D appear to be elevated in a mutually exclusive manner in ATL. Indeed, high serum levels of KL-6 were closely related to the stage of ATL, while the serum SP-D was elevated in ATL patients with pulmonary infection. In conclusion, the combined measurement of KL-6 and SP-D in ATL may become a useful means to discriminate leukemic pulmonary lesions from infectious pulmonary complications.","['Osaka, Akemi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Inokuchi, Naoko', 'Hayashi, Tomayoshi', 'Komoda, Minori', 'Nakamura, Shigeki', 'Aoyama, Muneo', 'Sawada, Takashi', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Osaka A', 'Yanagihara K', 'Yamada Y', 'Hasegawa H', 'Inokuchi N', 'Hayashi T', 'Komoda M', 'Nakamura S', 'Aoyama M', 'Sawada T', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/*complications/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*blood/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucin-1/*blood', 'Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D/*blood']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/tjem/218.99 [pii]', '10.1620/tjem.218.99 [doi]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2009 Jun;218(2):99-105. doi: 10.1620/tjem.218.99.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, why are HPNs induced equivocally and at only threshold level with low-dose benzene exposure despite the significant genotoxicity of benzene even at low doses both in experiments and in epidemiology? Second, why is there no linear increase in incidence at high-dose exposure despite a lower acute toxicity (LD(50) > 1000 mg/kg body weight; WHO, 2003, Benzene in drinking-water. Background document for development of WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality)? Third, why are particular acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) not commonly observed in mice, although AMLs are frequently observed in human cases of occupational exposure to benzene? In this study, we hypothesized that the threshold-like equivocal induction of HPNs at low-dose benzene exposure is based on DNA repair potential in wild-type mice and that the limited increase in HPNs at a high-dose exposure is due to excessive apoptosis in wild-type mice. To determine whether Trp53 deficiency satisfies the above hypotheses by eliminating or reducing DNA repair and by allowing cells to escape apoptosis, we evaluated the incidence of benzene-induced HPNs in Trp53-deficient C57BL/6 mice with specific regard to AMLs. We also used C3H/He mice, AML prone, with Trp53 deficiency to explore whether a higher incidence of AMLs on benzene exposure might explain the above human-murine differences. As a result, heterozygous Trp53-deficient mice of both strains showed a nonthreshold response of the incidence of HPNs at the lower dose, whereas both strains showed an increasing HPN incidence up to 100% with increasing benzene exposure dose, including AMLs, that developed 38% of heterozygous Trp53-deficient C3H/He mice compared to only 9% of wild-type mice exposed to the high dose. The detection of AMLs in heterozygous Trp53-deficient mice, even in the C57BL/6 strain, implies that benzene may be a potent inducer of AMLs also in mice with some strain differences.","['Kawasaki, Yasushi', 'Hirabayashi, Yoko', 'Kaneko, Toyozo', 'Kanno, Jun', 'Kodama, Yukio', 'Matsushima, Yuuko', 'Ogawa, Yukio', 'Saitoh, Minoru', 'Sekita, Kiyoshi', 'Uchida, Osayuki', 'Umemura, Takashi', 'Yoon, Byung-Il', 'Inoue, Tohru']","['Kawasaki Y', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Kaneko T', 'Kanno J', 'Kodama Y', 'Matsushima Y', 'Ogawa Y', 'Saitoh M', 'Sekita K', 'Uchida O', 'Umemura T', 'Yoon BI', 'Inoue T']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, Center for Biological Safety and Research, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Species Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/09/18 06:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['kfp107 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfp107 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2009 Aug;110(2):293-306. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfp107.

Information on proportion of optimal birth weight, a measure of the appropriateness of fetal growth, was collected from mothers by questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using logistic regression. Risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was positively associated with proportion of optimal birth weight; the odds ratio for a 1-standard-deviation increase in proportion of optimal birth weight was 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.35) after adjustment for the matching variables and potential confounders. This association was also present among children who did not have a high birth weight, suggesting that accelerated growth, rather than high birth weight per se, is associated with risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Similar associations between proportion of optimal birth weight and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were observed for both sexes and across age groups and leukemia subtypes. Results of this study confirm earlier findings of a positive association between rapidity of fetal growth and subsequent risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood, and they are consistent with a role for insulin-like growth factors in the causal pathway.","['Milne, E', 'Royle, J A', 'de Klerk, N H', 'Blair, E', 'Bailey, H', 'Cole, C', 'Attia, J', 'Scott, R J', 'Armstrong, B K']","['Milne E', 'Royle JA', 'de Klerk NH', 'Blair E', 'Bailey H', 'Cole C', 'Attia J', 'Scott RJ', 'Armstrong BK']","['Centre for Child Health Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. lizm@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia/epidemiology', '*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Fetal Development', '*Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Logistic Models', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['kwp117 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwp117 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2009 Jul 15;170(2):221-8. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwp117.

We present the case of a girl with cutaneous involvement prior to the diagnosis of a malignant lymphoproliferative process. A previously healthy 5-month old girl who presented with an inflammatory subcutaneous lesion on the right foot. During hospital admission due to bronchiolitis at 7 months with associated pancytopenia while the myelogram showed myeloid and megakaryocytic hypoplasia, the abdominal and foot ultrasound were normal. After completing corticoid therapy for her respiratory process and transfusional support, the foot lesion had disappeared at discharge. Two months later she had a local recurrence with associated scattered subcutaneous nodules. The skin biopsy confirmed malignant infiltration; the myelogram showed 6% blast infiltration, and both abdominal ultrasound and CT scan demonstrated lymph node involvement. Immunophenotype confirmed the diagnosis of Precursor B Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma. Although complete remission was achieved at the end of the induction chemotherapy according Euro-LB-02 protocol for stage IV, the patient presented a refractory leukaemia relapse thirteen months after diagnosis. COMMENTARY: Malignancy should be suspected in the presence of a skin lesion with torpid evolution and biopsy should be considered. Differential diagnosis of malignant skin lesions in children, especially in infants, must include mainly secondary involvement of leukaemia, lymphoma, metastases of neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma and less frequently other primary processes.

Flt3 mutations are found in approximately one-third of AML patients and correlate with a poor prognosis, thus making the Flt3 receptor a potential therapeutic target. The aim of the investigation was to analyze the kinetics and specificity of Flt3 autophosphorylation in wild-type Flt3 as well as in oncogenic Flt3 mutants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have used Ba/F3 cells stably expressing either wild-type, internal tandem duplication, or D835Y mutants of Flt3 in order to compare the site selectivity of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. By the use of a panel of phosphospecific antibodies directed against potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Flt3, we identified several novel phosphorylation sites in Flt3 and studied the kinetics and specificity of ligand-induced phosphorylation in living cells. RESULTS: Eight phosphorylated tyrosines (pY589, pY591, pY599, pY726, pY768, pY793, pY842, and pY955) were investigated and shown to be differentially phosphorylated in the wild-type versus the mutated receptors. Furthermore, we show that tyrosines 726, 793, and 842 are novel phosphorylation sites of Flt3 in intact cells. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have looked at the site-specific phosphorylation in the wild-type Flt3 in comparison to the mutants found in AML. We observed not only quantitative changes but, more importantly, qualitative differences in the phosphorylation patterns of the wild-type and the mutated Flt3 receptors, which might enhance the understanding of the mechanisms by which Flt3 contributes to AML in patients with mutations in Flt3.","['Razumovskaya, Elena', 'Masson, Kristina', 'Khan, Rasheed', 'Bengtsson, Susanne', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Razumovskaya E', 'Masson K', 'Khan R', 'Bengtsson S', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Malmo University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090527,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00176-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Aug;37(8):979-89. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.05.008.

Based on the decline in cellular ATP pool following 8-Cl-Ado treatment, we hypothesized that 8-Cl-ADP and 8-Cl-ATP may interfere with ATP synthase, a key enzyme in ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthase is composed of two major parts; F(O) intermembrane base and F1 domain, containing alpha and beta subunits. Crystal structures of both alpha and beta subunits that bind to the substrate, ADP, are known in tight binding (alpha(dp)beta(dp)) and loose binding (alpha(tp)beta(tp)) states. Molecular docking demonstrated that 8-Cl-ADP/8-Cl-ATP occupied similar binding modes as ADP/ATP in the tight and loose binding sites of ATP synthase, respectively, suggesting that the chlorinated nucleotide metabolites may be functional substrates and inhibitors of the enzyme. The computational predictions were consistent with our whole cell biochemical results. Oligomycin, an established pharmacological inhibitor of ATP synthase, decreased both ATP and 8-Cl-ATP formation from exogenous substrates, however, did not affect pyrimidine nucleoside analogue triphosphate accumulation. Synthesis of ATP from ADP was inhibited in cells loaded with 8-Cl-ATP. These biochemical studies are in consent with the computational modeling; in the alpha(tp)beta(tp) state 8-Cl-ATP occupies similar binding as ANP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP mimic that is a known inhibitor. Similarly, in the substrate binding site (alpha(dp)beta(dp)) 8-Cl-ATP occupies a similar position as ATP mimic ADP-BeF(3)(-). Collectively, our current work suggests that 8-Cl-ADP may serve as a substrate and the 8-Cl-ATP may be an inhibitor of ATP synthase.","['Chen, Lisa S', 'Nowak, Billie J', 'Ayres, Mary L', 'Krett, Nancy L', 'Rosen, Steven T', 'Zhang, Shuxing', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Chen LS', 'Nowak BJ', 'Ayres ML', 'Krett NL', 'Rosen ST', 'Zhang S', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

Consequent ds-RNA over ds-DNA selectivity of 7 and 8 is the most appealing and rather rare property among small molecules.

Virions of PRRSV contain six membrane proteins: the major proteins GP5 and M and the minor proteins GP2, GP3, GP4, and E. The GP5 is the major envelope proteins, which was involved in the formation and infectivity of PRRSV by coaction with other membrane proteins. Here, to determine the function of alone GP5 envelope protein in viral entry, we investigated the formation and infectivity of GP5-pseudotyped virus particles. By co-transfection of GP5 expression plasmids with murine leukemia virus (MuLV) based retroviral vectors (pHIT60, encoding MuLV Gag-Pol; pHIT111, encoding an MuLV genome with a beta-galactosidase reporter gene) into 293 T cells and analysis of the culture medium using ultracentrifugation, Western blot, and infection assay. We observed that the GP5 envelope protein was incorporated into the MuLV retroviral vectors to generate an pseudotyped murine leukemia virus, which was infectious to PAM and Mack-145 target cells and displayed the same host range with wild-type PRRSV. The infection of the pseudotyped virus on PAM target cells is effectively neutralized by polyclonal antibodies specific for PRRSV or GP5. The results suggested that the GP5 protein may play a key role in the viral entry by interacting with the host cell receptor. The GP5-pseudotyped virus will be useful in the identification of the cellular receptor binding with GP5 protein.","['Xia, Ping an', 'Dang, Zhan guo', 'Qiu, Huang', 'Fan, Xu', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Cui, Bao an', 'Chen, Pu yan']","['Xia Pa', 'Dang Zg', 'Qiu H', 'Fan X', 'Zhou B', 'Cui Ba', 'Chen Py']","['Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China. xpa88@163.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090419,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein 5, PRRSV)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Humans', 'Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus/*classification/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(09)00203-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2009 Sep 18;138(3-4):297-303. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.04.013.

Patients or their parent completed simple visual analogue scales (VASs; 0-10) for relaxation, vitality, overall well-being, stress, anxiety, and depression before and after a 20-minute period of rest and a standardized HT treatment. Patients' heart rates were monitored and later analyzed for heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics. Of the nine patients, all completed VASs and six had usable HRV data. The average age was 9 years. VAS scores for stress decreased significantly more for HT treatment than for rest (HT: 4.4-1.7; rest: 2.3-2.3; p = .03). The HRV characteristic of total power was significantly lower during HT than for rest (HT 599 +/- 221; rest: 857 +/- 155; p = .048), and sympathetic activity was somewhat but not significantly lower (HT: 312 +/- 158; rest: 555 +/- 193; p = .06).

Immediate treatment of APL is critical, as it is an oncologic emergency, with a high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, administration of chemotherapy and differentiating agents in pregnancy is controversial because of potential teratogenic effects. In addition, complications associated with APL, including retinoic acid syndrome, add to the complexity of management. To better understand how to manage this complex patient care situation, we searched the PubMed database (January 1972-May 2008) for English-language articles about maternal and fetal outcomes resulting from APL treatment during pregnancy. A total of 42 cases from 35 articles were identified: 12 first-trimester, 21 second-trimester, and 9 third-trimester cases. The most commonly administered agents were all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), anthracyclines, and antimetabolites. Complete remission was reported in 35 (83%) of 42 patients. Administration of ATRA or chemotherapy in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations and spontaneous abortion, whereas administration in the second and third trimesters was associated with relatively favorable fetal outcomes. The overall treatment of the pregnant patient with APL should include a discussion about pregnancy termination, especially if APL is diagnosed in the first trimester. If the pregnancy is to continue, then the appropriate chemotherapy regimen needs to be determined. Frequent fetal monitoring, along with aggressive management of potential APL-related complications, is necessary to allow for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes.","['Yang, Daisy', 'Hladnik, Lindsay']","['Yang D', 'Hladnik L']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Texas M.

Applications to the testing of different drug combinations and the parallel screening of different leukemia cell lines as well as primary patient cells are presented. The diffusion device yields qualitatively and quantitatively comparable results to an MTT viability assay conducted in a standard 96-well format albeit with a tremendous reduction of processing steps. In addition, a fluorescence-based annexin V binding assay of cell death was implemented. Next to the reduction of processing steps, the diffusion device constitutes a considerable assay miniaturization that overcomes the problems typically associated with miniaturization as a consequence of small sample volumes. Given its ease of handling, the device will greatly advance the development and optimization of combination drugs and the identification of optimum drug combinations in personalized medicine.","['Ganser, Alexander', 'Roth, Gunter', 'van Galen, Joost C', 'Hilderink, Janneke', 'Wammes, Joost J G', 'Muller, Ingo', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N', 'Wiesmuller, Karl-Heinz', 'Brock, Roland']","['Ganser A', 'Roth G', 'van Galen JC', 'Hilderink J', 'Wammes JJ', 'Muller I', 'van Leeuwen FN', 'Wiesmuller KH', 'Brock R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Clofarabine', 'Diffusion', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Miniaturization', 'Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Toxicity Tests/*instrumentation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/05/30 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/05/30 09:00'],"['2009/05/30 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac900415s [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2009 Jul 1;81(13):5233-40. doi: 10.1021/ac900415s.,10.1021/ac900415s [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protocol included IDA at 20 mg/sqm daily as 3 days continuous infusion (from day -13 to -11) and intravenous BU at 3.2 mg/kg daily from day -5 to -2. Patients aged over 60 years received a reduced schedule (2 days IDA and 3 days BU at the same dose). Twenty-five patients with a median age of 51 years (28-72) were enrolled. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). The median interval between diagnosis and ASCT was 4 months. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5.9 x 10E6/kg. The median number of days to PMN >500/cmm and platelets >20000/cmm was 10 and 13, respectively. In order to perform a comparison in terms of haematological and non haematological toxicity, a group of 30 patients, who were previously autografted after conditioning with IDA and oral Bu was considered. Selection of factors for a matched pair analysis included median age, percentage of subjects aged over 60 years, median CD34+ cell received, cytogenetic and molecular findings and per cent of secondary AML. As compared to previous series, the occurrence of severe mucositis was dramatically reduced (80% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001).

These patients have been followed together with a control group of 1,324 ankylosing spondylitis patients treated neither with radioactive drugs nor with X-rays. The mean follow-up time was 26.3 years in the exposed and 24.6 years in the control group. To date, causes of death have been ascertained for 1,006 exposed patients and 1,072 controls. Special emphasis was placed on the reporting of malignant diseases. Expected numbers of cases were computed for the age, sex and calendar year distribution of both groups using cancer registry incidence rates. In the exposed group 18 cases of kidney cancer (vs. 9.1 cases expected, P < 0.01) and 4 malignant thyroid tumours (vs. 1.2 cases expected, P = 0.03) were observed. In the control group the observed cases for these tumours were not significantly elevated. The most striking observation, however, were the 21 cases of leukaemia in the exposed group (vs. 6.8 cases expected, P < 0.001) compared to 12 cases of leukaemia in the control group (vs. 7.5 cases expected). Further sub-classification of the leukaemias demonstrated a high increase of myeloid leukaemia in the exposed group (12 cases observed vs. 2.9 cases expected, P < 0.001), and out of these, especially a high excess of acute myeloid leukaemias (7 cases observed vs. 1.8 expected, P = 0.003). In the controls the observed cases are within the expected range (4 myeloid leukaemias vs. 3.1 cases). This increase in total leukaemias as well as particularly in myeloid leukaemias is significant in direct comparison between the exposed and control groups too (P < 0.05). The enhanced leukaemia incidence in the exposed group is in line with the observation of increased leukaemia incidence in mice injected with (224)Ra.","['Wick, Roland R', 'Atkinson, M J', 'Nekolla, E A']","['Wick RR', 'Atkinson MJ', 'Nekolla EA']","['Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Institute of Radiobiology, Neuherberg, Germany. wick@helmholtz-muenchen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090528,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,"['13233-32-4 (thorium X)', '60YU5MIG9W (Thorium)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alpha Particles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radium/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/radiotherapy', 'Thorium', 'Time Factors']",2009/05/29 09:00,2009/10/13 06:00,['2009/05/29 09:00'],"['2008/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-009-0227-y [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2009 Aug;48(3):287-94. doi: 10.1007/s00411-009-0227-y.

We studied alterations in the mRNA expression levels of BCL2, BAX, CYC, BCL-XL, and VDR genes in the K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell line in response to treatment with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Morphological observation of K562 cells was evaluated by the staining with Wright's solution. Cell percentage at different phases of the cell cycle was measured, and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found that treatment with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) down-regulates BCL2 and BCL-XL mRNA expressions, as well as up-regulates expressions of BAX and p21 mRNA. The expression pattern of CYC and VDR genes were not influenced. However, K562 cells treated with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) caused an arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 phase resulting in a decreased number of cells in the S phase, complemented by an accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phases.

This observation formed the conceptual basis for developing oncolytic viruses deleted for viral proteins that inhibit the host IFN-dependent antiviral response, such as herpes simplex virus type-1 infected cell protein-0 (ICP0) and vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein. Many viruses have evolved means to disrupt promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. For example, ICP0 promotes PML degradation to inhibit the antiviral activities of this IFN-stimulated gene. As PML is downregulated in a variety of tumors, we hypothesized ICP0-null herpes simplex type-1 viruses are selectively oncolytic in tumors with impaired PML expression. We illustrate that ICP0-null herpes simplex type-1 viruses target tumor cells that either possess impaired PML signaling or cannot upregulate PML because of impaired IFN responsiveness. Disruption of PML signaling through overexpression of the dominant-negative protein PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha in PML-positive cells renders them sensitive to oncolysis by ICP0-null herpes simplex virus type-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus M protein mutant viruses, whereas PML overexpression reverses this phenomenon. Together, these data illustrate that PML mediates an antiviral mechanism that predicts the tropism of IFN-sensitive oncolytic viruses. To our knowledge, these viruses are the first examples of anti-cancer therapeutics capable of targeting deficiencies in PML expression.","['Sobol, P T', 'Hummel, J L', 'Rodrigues, R M', 'Mossman, K L']","['Sobol PT', 'Hummel JL', 'Rodrigues RM', 'Mossman KL']","['Departments of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090528,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*methods', 'Oncolytic Viruses/drug effects/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Simplexvirus/drug effects/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/drug effects/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Viral Tropism']",2009/05/29 09:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2009/05/29 09:00'],"['2009/05/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['gt200968 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2009.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2009 Sep;16(9):1077-87. doi: 10.1038/gt.2009.68.

With the availability of imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, physicians must weigh the efficacy and safety profile of each agent when choosing the best therapeutic option for individual patients. Each agent targets tyrosine kinases within the cell uniquely to cause the desired antiproliferative effect. In addition to inhibiting the BCR-ABL kinase, imatinib and nilotinib target the same array of other tyrosine kinases, including c-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), albeit with differing potencies. While targeting BCR-ABL with the highest potency among approved agents in CML, dasatinib also targets a broad array of off-target kinases, including SRC family members, PDGFR and EPHB4. The differences in kinase inhibition profiles among these agents in vitro probably account for the differing clinical safety profiles of these agents.

The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of MNDA in normal and reactive human tissue, and in a large series of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas, with particular emphasis on NMZL and FL. Our results showed that MNDA is expressed in normal tissue by a subset of the marginal zone B cells. They also showed MNDA expression in subgroups of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle-cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but MNDA was especially expressed by lymphomas derived from the marginal zone, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma, splenic marginal-zone lymphoma and NMZL. MNDA expression was rarely observed in FL, a characteristic that is of potential value in distinguishing between NMZL and FL.

The mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well defined. METHODS: We conducted a combination of molecular, cytogenetic, comparative-genomic-hybridization, and single-nucleotide-polymorphism analyses to identify a candidate tumor-suppressor gene common to patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The coding sequence of this gene, TET2, was determined in 320 patients. We analyzed the consequences of deletions or mutations in TET2 with the use of in vitro clonal assays and transplantation of human tumor cells into mice. RESULTS: We initially identified deletions or mutations in TET2 in three patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, in three of five patients with myeloproliferative disorders, in two patients with primary AML, and in one patient with secondary AML. We selected the six patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or AML because they carried acquired rearrangements on chromosome 4q24; we selected the five patients with myeloproliferative disorders because they carried a dominant clone in hematopoietic progenitor cells that was positive for the V617F mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. TET2 defects were observed in 15 of 81 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (19%), in 24 of 198 patients with myeloproliferative disorders (12%) (with or without the JAK2 V617F mutation), in 5 of 21 patients with secondary AML (24%), and in 2 of 9 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (22%). TET2 defects were present in hematopoietic stem cells and preceded the JAK2 V617F mutation in the five samples from patients with myeloproliferative disorders that we analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic mutations in TET2 occur in about 15% of patients with various myeloid cancers.","['Delhommeau, Francois', 'Dupont, Sabrina', 'Della Valle, Veronique', 'James, Chloe', 'Trannoy, Severine', 'Masse, Aline', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Le Couedic, Jean-Pierre', 'Robert, Fabienne', 'Alberdi, Antonio', 'Lecluse, Yann', 'Plo, Isabelle', 'Dreyfus, Francois J', 'Marzac, Christophe', 'Casadevall, Nicole', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Romana, Serge P', 'Dessen, Philippe', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Viguie, Franck', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Bernard, Olivier A']","['Delhommeau F', 'Dupont S', 'Della Valle V', 'James C', 'Trannoy S', 'Masse A', 'Kosmider O', 'Le Couedic JP', 'Robert F', 'Alberdi A', 'Lecluse Y', 'Plo I', 'Dreyfus FJ', 'Marzac C', 'Casadevall N', 'Lacombe C', 'Romana SP', 'Dessen P', 'Soulier J', 'Viguie F', 'Fontenay M', 'Vainchenker W', 'Bernard OA']","['INSERM U790, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion']",2009/05/29 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/05/29 09:00'],"['2009/05/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['360/22/2289 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0810069 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2009 May 28;360(22):2289-301. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0810069.,10.1056/NEJMoa0810069 [doi],,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2009 May 28;360(22):2355-7.

For a decade, gene expression profiling (GEP) has been applied in leukaemia research. Thus, various studies demonstrated worldwide that the majority of genetically defined leukaemia subtypes are accurately predictable by GEP, for example, with respect to reciprocal rearrangements in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Moreover, novel prognostically relevant gene classifiers were developed as, for example, in normal karyotype AML. Considering the lymphatic malignancies, GEP studies defined novel clinically relevant subtypes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and improved the discrimination of Burkitt lymphoma and DLBCL cases, overcoming considerable overlaps of these entities that exist from morphological and genetic perspectives. Treatment-specific sensitivity assays are being developed for targeted drugs such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors in AML or imatinib in BCR-ABL1 positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Irrespectively of these proceedings, an introduction of the microarray technology in haematological practice requires diagnostic algorithms and strategies for interaction with currently established diagnostic techniques. Large multicentre studies such as the MILE Study (Microarray Innovations in LEukemia) aim at translating this methodology into clinical routine workflows and to catalyze this process.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Kohlmann A', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, D-81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090527,England,Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic,Briefings in functional genomics & proteomics,101150306,,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Humans']",2009/05/29 09:00,2009/12/31 06:00,['2009/05/29 09:00'],"['2009/05/29 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['elp011 [pii]', '10.1093/bfgp/elp011 [doi]']",ppublish,Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic. 2009 May;8(3):184-93. doi: 10.1093/bfgp/elp011.

It has been implicated in embryonic patterning and leukemia, and causally linked to restless legs syndrome. The MEIS1A C terminus harbors a transcriptional activation domain that is stimulated by protein kinase A (PKA) in a manner dependent on the co-activator of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-binding protein (CBP). We explored the involvement of another mediator of PKA-inducible transcription, namely the CREB co-activators transducers of regulated CREB activity (TORCs). Overexpression of TORC1 or TORC2 bypassed PKA for activation by MEIS1A. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between MEIS1 and TORC2 that is dependent on the MEIS1A C terminus, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed PKA-inducible recruitment of MEIS1, PBX1, and TORC2 on the MEIS1 target genes Hoxb2 and Meis1. The MEIS1 interaction domain on TORC1 was mapped to the N-terminal coiled-coil region, and TORC1 mutants lacking this domain attenuated the response to PKA on a natural MEIS1A target enhancer.

The parent's own mental health was assessed by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30). Children treated for ALL showed on average significantly more symptoms as measured by the CBCL Total Behaviour Score for mother's report (P = 0.005), and for father's report (P = 0.004) compared with healthy children. Fathers reported more anxiety (P = 0.03) and depression (P = 0.02) as measured by the GHQ-30 compared with healthy controls. Children in remission from ALL showed on average significantly more problems regarding mental health and psychosocial adjustment, as reported by their parents, compared with healthy controls.

Compound 4, the more promising of the two compounds, exerts earlier onset of anticancer effects on Jurkat cells via induction of apoptosis compared to the traditional alkylating anticancer agent melphalan. In addition, it demonstrated higher potency on ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 cell line and lower fold resistance between Jurkat and Jurkat-M cells selected for the resistance to melphalan.

The 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid malignancies included these MPDs under the broader category of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD), which also included chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia/hypereosinophilic syndrome (CEL/HES), and ""CMPD, unclassifiable."" The revised 2008 WHO classification system featured the following changes: 1) the term ""CMPD"" was replaced by ""myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN),"" 2) mast cell disease was formally included under the category of MPN, and 3) the subcategory of CEL/HES was reorganized into ""CEL not otherwise specified (CEL-NOS)"" and ""myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1""; CEL-NOS remained a subcategory of ""MPN,"" whereas the latter neoplasms were now assigned a new category of their own. Furthermore, diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF were revised by incorporating recently described molecular markers (eg, JAK2 and MPL mutations) as well as underscoring the role of histology in differentiating reactive from clonal myeloproliferations. As a result, red cell mass measurement is no longer necessary for the diagnosis of PV, and ET can now be diagnosed at a lower platelet count threshold. The revised WHO document continues to promote the recognition of histologic categories as a necessary first step toward the genetic characterization of myeloid malignancies.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Thiele, Juergen', 'Vardiman, James W']","['Tefferi A', 'Thiele J', 'Vardiman JW']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*classification', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/classification', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/classification', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/classification', 'World Health Organization']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24440 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Sep 1;115(17):3842-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24440.,10.1002/cncr.24440 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we demonstrated that Tax1 enhances cancer cell proliferation via Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway by using molecular section strategy. The pull-down assay showed that the four amino acid domain, that is, Tax1 350-353, might specifically interact with Erbin, but not any other Tax1 deletion mutants. The coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed that Tax1 350-353 domain bound with Erbin in vivo. Functional study demonstrated that overexpression of Tax1 in cancer cell lines of liver cancer SMMC-7721, colon cancer HCT-116, and breast cancer MCF-7 facilitated the cell proliferation. And the transfection of Tax1 353 in MCF-7 cells with endogenous Erbin expression markedly increased phosphorylation of Ras, Raf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, PI3K, and IkappaBalpha, suggesting that Tax1-enhanced cell proliferation tracks Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway.","['Song, Chunjiao', 'Wang, Weimin', 'Li, Meng', 'Liu, Yanxin', 'Zheng, Dexian']","['Song C', 'Wang W', 'Li M', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng D']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (ERBIN protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TAX1BP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/iub.221 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2009 Jun;61(6):685-92. doi: 10.1002/iub.221.,10.1002/iub.221 [doi],,,,,,,,['(c) 2009 IUBMB.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient developed the symptoms of fever, generalized myalgia, dysarthria, and asymptomatic sinus tachycardia at DLI day +102, and 17 days after the discontinuation of immunosuppressants. The laboratory testing showed elevated muscle enzymes, and the electromyographic examination revealed myopathic abnormalities compatible with the diagnosis of myositis. The muscle biopsy showed CD8+ T cell infiltration of the muscle fibers. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block, anteroseptal ST elevation and lateral ST depression. Echocardiography showed mild hypokinesia of the left interventricular septal wall without evidence of infection or leukemic relapse.

These cellular activities often rely on the localization of PML to unique subnuclear structures known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs). More than 50 cellular proteins are known to traffic in and out of PML NBs, either transiently or constitutively. In order to understand the dynamics of these NBs, it is important to delineate the regulation of PML itself. PML is subject to extensive regulation at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. Many of these modes of regulation depend on the cellular context and the presence of extracellular signals. This review focuses on the current knowledge of regulation of PML under normal cellular conditions as well as the role for regulation of PML in viral infection and cancer.","['Reineke, Erin L', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Reineke EL', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University and the Comprehensive Cancer Center of CWRU, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090522,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.7150/ijbs.5.366 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2009 May 22;5(4):366-76. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.5.366.,,PMC2686094,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PML', 'cell signaling', 'nuclear body', 'tumor suppressor', 'virus']",,,,

But the molecular causes of uterine leiomyoma remain unclear. We conducted the current investigation in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms in the development of uterine leiomyoma. METHODS: We employed a new and accurate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method that involved annealing control primers (ACPs) to identify the genes that are differently expressed in uterine leiomyoma. RESULTS: Using 120 ACPs, we identified and sequenced 14 differently expressed genes (DEGs) in uterine leiomyoma compared with normal myometrium. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches were performed to examine the known functions of these genes associated with uterine leiomyoma. We confirmed differently expressed patterns in more cases using the RT-PCR method. We also detected two novel genes, Tenascin-X and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR), which had not yet been reported to have any functions associated with uterine leiomyoma. RT-PCR confirmation shows that both of these two genes are down-regulated in uterine leiomyoma. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Tenascin-X and LIFR may play a role in the development of uterine leiomyoma. Although further studies are required to establish the precise mechanisms with which these genes are involved in the genesis of uterine leiomyoma, the present research is significant in that it is the first study which detects down-regulated novel genes in uterine leiomyoma using the ACP system.","['Lee, Sun Ok', 'Lee, Soo Yoon', 'Lee, Sa Ra', 'Ju, Woong', 'Kim, Seung Cheol']","['Lee SO', 'Lee SY', 'Lee SR', 'Ju W', 'Kim SC']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080620,Korea (South),J Gynecol Oncol,Journal of gynecologic oncology,101483150,,,,2009/05/28 09:00,2009/05/28 09:01,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/28 09:01 [medline]']",['10.3802/jgo.2008.19.2.139 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gynecol Oncol. 2008 Jun;19(2):139-44. doi: 10.3802/jgo.2008.19.2.139.

Because topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo-IIalpha) is a target for doxorubicin and is coamplified in 20% to 50% of HER2-amplified tumors, we postulated that Topo-IIalpha copy number might account for the benefit from CAF dose escalation in HER2-positive tumors. To address this hypothesis, we examined Topo-IIalpha and HER2 copy number, CAF dose, and clinical outcomes in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8541. PATIENTS AND METHODS Topo-IIalpha and HER2 copy number were measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a triple-probe system, which includes Topo-IIalpha, HER2, and chromosome 17 (CEP17). Topo-IIalpha and/or HER2 were classified as amplified (> or = two copies/CEP17, deleted (< or = 0.67 copies/CEP17) and normal copy number (> .67 to < 2.0 copies/CEP17). Results Topo-IIalpha/HER2/CEP17 measurement was successful in 624 of 687 cases. HER2 was amplified in 117 cases (19%). Topo-IIalpha was amplified in 41 cases (7%) and deleted in 69 cases (11%). Topo-IIalpha amplification was highly correlated with HER2 amplification (39 of 41; P < .0001), HER2 by immunohistochemistry, and by dual-probe FISH. Topo-IIalpha was deleted in both the HER2-amplified (30 of 69; 43%), normal (22 of 69; 32%) and HER2-deleted tumors (17 of 69; 25%). Although Topo-IIalpha-amplified tumors were nearly always HER2 amplified, these tumors did not receive benefit from increasing the dose of CAF (P = .15). CONCLUSION The correlative companion study CALGB 8541-150013 does not support the hypothesis that Topo-IIalpha amplification is the mechanism behind benefit from increased dose of anthracyclines in HER2-positive breast cancer.","['Harris, Lyndsay N', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Abu-Khalaf, Maysa', 'Cowan, David', 'Thor, Ann D', 'Budman, Daniel', 'Cirrincione, Constance T', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A', 'Hayes, Daniel F', 'Friedman, Paula', 'Ellis, Matthew', 'Dressler, Lynn']","['Harris LN', 'Broadwater G', 'Abu-Khalaf M', 'Cowan D', 'Thor AD', 'Budman D', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Berry DA', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA', 'Hayes DF', 'Friedman P', 'Ellis M', 'Dressler L']","['333 Cedar St, WWW 213, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06850, USA. lyndsay.harris@yale.edu']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090526,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.4085 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.4085 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jul 20;27(21):3430-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.4085.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with asymptomatic Rai stage 0 to II CLL were eligible for participation. Polyphenon E with a standardized dose of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was administered using the standard phase I design with three to six patients per dose level (range, 400 to 2,000 mg by mouth twice a day). Trough plasma EGCG levels were measured 1 month after initiation of therapy. Response was classified using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group (WG) Criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible patients were accrued to dose levels 1 to 8. The maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. The most common adverse effects included transaminitis (33%, all grade 1), abdominal pain (30% grade 1, 0% grade 2, and 3% grade 3), and nausea (39% grade 1 and 9% grade 2). One patient experienced an NCI WG partial remission. Other signs of clinical activity were also observed, with 11 patients (33%) having a sustained > or = 20% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and 11 (92%) of 12 patients with palpable adenopathy experiencing at least a 50% reduction in the sum of the products of all nodal areas during treatment. Trough plasma EGCG levels after 1 month of treatment ranged from 2.9 to 3,974 ng/mL (median, 40.4 ng/mL).

In this study, we purified RUNX-1-containing multiprotein complexes from phorbol ester-induced L8057 murine megakaryoblastic cells and identified the ets transcription factor FLI-1 as a novel in vivo-associated factor. The interaction occurs via direct protein-protein interactions and results in synergistic transcriptional activation of the c-mpl promoter. Interestingly, the interaction fails to occur in uninduced cells. Gel filtration chromatography confirms the differentiation-dependent binding and shows that it correlates with the assembly of a complex also containing the key megakaryocyte transcription factors GATA-1 and Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1). Phosphorylation analysis of FLI-1 with uninduced versus induced L8057 cells suggests the loss of phosphorylation at serine 10 in the induced state. Substitution of Ser10 with the phosphorylation mimic aspartic acid selectively impairs RUNX-1 binding, abrogates transcriptional synergy with RUNX-1, and dominantly inhibits primary fetal liver megakaryocyte differentiation in vitro. Conversely, substitution with alanine, which blocks phosphorylation, augments differentiation of primary megakaryocytes. We propose that dephosphorylation of FLI-1 is a key event in the transcriptional regulation of megakaryocyte maturation.

Because most nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients harbor EBV, we proceeded to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of seliciclib in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cytotoxicity of seliciclib was investigated in the EBV-positive cell line C666-1 and the C666-1 and C15 xenograft models. Caspase activities and cell cycle analyses were measured by flow cytometry. Efficacy of combined treatment of seliciclib with radiation therapy was also evaluated. RESULTS: Seliciclib caused significant cytotoxicity in the C666-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in both sub-G(1) and G(2)-M phases, indicative of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, respectively. Caspase-2, -3, -8, and -9 activities were all increased, with caspase-3 being the most significantly activated at 48 h after treatment. These cells also showed a reduction of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels. Combined treatment of seliciclib with radiation therapy showed a synergistic interaction with enhanced cytotoxicity in C666-1 cells and delayed repair of double-strand DNA breaks. For in vivo models, significant delays in tumor growth were observed for both C666-1 and C15 tumors, which were associated with enhanced apoptosis as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and immunohistochemistry analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Seliciclib enhanced the antitumor efficacy of radiation therapy in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma, characterized by G(2)-M arrest, and apoptosis, associated with an induction in caspase activity. This process is mediated by reduction in Mcl-1 expression and by attenuation of double-strand DNA break repair.","['Hui, Angela B Y', 'Yue, Shijun', 'Shi, Wei', 'Alajez, Nehad M', 'Ito, Emma', 'Green, Simon R', 'Frame, Sheelagh', ""O'Sullivan, Brian"", 'Liu, Fei-Fei']","['Hui AB', 'Yue S', 'Shi W', 'Alajez NM', 'Ito E', 'Green SR', 'Frame S', ""O'Sullivan B"", 'Liu FF']","['Division of Applied Molecular Oncology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090526,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 2/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*therapeutic use', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Roscovitine', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2790 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2790 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;15(11):3716-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2790.

Previous studies suggest that the unfolded protein response is activated in some cancer cell lines and involved in tumor development. The role of the unfolded protein response during leukemogenesis is unknown thus far. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we assessed the induction of key effectors of the unfolded protein response in leukemic cells at diagnosis of 105 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients comprising all subtypes. We determined the formation of the spliced variant of the X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, as well as expression levels of calreticulin, GRP78, and CHOP mRNA. RESULTS: The formation of the spliced variant of XBP1s was detectable in 16.2% (17 of 105) of AML patients. Consistent with activated unfolded protein response, this group also had significantly increased expression of calreticulin, GRP78, and CHOP. AML patients with activated unfolded protein response had lower WBC counts, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and more frequently, secondary AML. The incidence of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations was significantly lower in patients with activated unfolded protein response. In addition, an association was observed between activated unfolded protein response and deletion of chromosome 7. Finally, the clinical course of AML patients with activated unfolded protein response was more favorable with lower relapse rate (P = 0.0182) and better overall (P = 0.041) and disease-free survival (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the unfolded protein response is activated in a considerable subset of AML patients. AML patients with activated unfolded protein response present specific clinical characteristics and a more favorable course of the disease.","['Schardt, Julian A', 'Weber, Daniel', 'Eyholzer, Marianne', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Schardt JA', 'Weber D', 'Eyholzer M', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Departments of Medical Oncology and Clinical Research, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090526,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', '*Protein Folding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2870 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2870 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;15(11):3834-41. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2870.

A total of 457 patients were enrolled with 24% 80 years of age or older. Tipifarnib 600 mg orally twice a day was administered for the first 21 consecutive days, in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The median survival was 107 days for the tipifarnib arm and 109 days for the BSC arm. The hazard ratio (tipifarnib vs BSC) for overall survival was 1.02 (P value by stratified log-rank test, .843). The complete response rate for tipifarnib in this study (8%) was lower than that observed previously, but with a similar median duration of 8 months. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were cytopenias in both arms, slightly more infections (39% vs 33%), and febrile neutropenia (16% vs 10%) seen in the tipifarnib arm.

To determine whether these observations could be extended to humans, a list of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53 pathway that can modify the function of p53 was assembled and used to study their impact on human fertility. The p53 allele encoding proline at codon 72 (P72) was found to be significantly enriched over the allele encoding arginine (R72) among in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients. The P72 allele serves as a risk factor for implantation failure. LIF levels are significantly lower in cells with the P72 allele than in cells with the R72 allele, which may contribute to the decreased implantation and fertility associated with the P72 allele. Selected alleles in SNPs in LIF, Mdm2, Mdm4, and Hausp genes, each of which regulates p53 levels in cells, are also enriched in IVF patients. Interestingly, the role of these SNPs on fertility was much reduced or absent in patients older than 35 years of age, indicating that other functions may play a more important role in infertility in older women. The association of SNPs in the p53 pathway with human fertility suggests that p53 regulates the efficiency of human reproduction. These results also provide a plausible explanation for the evolutionary positive selection of some alleles in the p53 pathway and demonstrate the alleles in the p53 pathway as a good example of antagonistic pleiotropy.","['Kang, Hey-Joo', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Sun, Yvonne', 'Atwal, Gurinder', 'Murphy, Maureen E', 'Rebbeck, Timothy R', 'Rosenwaks, Zev', 'Levine, Arnold J', 'Hu, Wenwei']","['Kang HJ', 'Feng Z', 'Sun Y', 'Atwal G', 'Murphy ME', 'Rebbeck TR', 'Rosenwaks Z', 'Levine AJ', 'Hu W']","['Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA102184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090522,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Codon', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Fertility/*genetics', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['0904280106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0904280106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Jun 16;106(24):9761-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0904280106.

Mutation of genes encoding tyrosine kinases is uncommon in ALL, with the exception of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, where the t(9,22)(q34;q11) translocation encodes the constitutively active BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. We recently identified a poor prognostic subgroup of pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative ALL patients characterized by deletion of IKZF1 (encoding the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS) and a gene expression signature similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, raising the possibility of activated tyrosine kinase signaling within this leukemia subtype. Here, we report activating mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 (n = 3), JAK2 (n = 16), and JAK3 (n = 1) in 20 (10.7%) of 187 BCR-ABL1-negative, high-risk pediatric ALL cases. The JAK1 and JAK2 mutations involved highly conserved residues in the kinase and pseudokinase domains and resulted in constitutive JAK-STAT activation and growth factor independence of Ba/F3-EpoR cells. The presence of JAK mutations was significantly associated with alteration of IKZF1 (70% of all JAK-mutated cases and 87.5% of cases with JAK2 mutations; P = 0.001) and deletion of CDKN2A/B (70% of all JAK-mutated cases and 68.9% of JAK2-mutated cases). The JAK-mutated cases had a gene expression signature similar to BCR-ABL1 pediatric ALL, and they had a poor outcome.

Although haploinsufficiency for the RPS14 gene and others encoded within the common deleted region (CDR) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the del(5q) phenotype, the molecular basis of the karyotype specificity of lenalidomide remains unexplained. We focused our analysis on possible haplodeficient enzymatic targets encoded within the CDR that play key roles in cell-cycle regulation. We show that the dual specificity phosphatases, Cdc25C and PP2Acalpha, which are coregulators of the G(2)-M checkpoint, are inhibited by lenalidomide. Gene expression was lower in MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) specimens with del(5q) compared with those with alternate karyotypes. Lenalidomide inhibited phosphatase activity either directly (Cdc25C) or indirectly (PP2A) with corresponding retention of inhibitory phospho-tyrosine residues. Treatment of del(5q) AML cells with lenalidomide induced G(2) arrest and apoptosis, whereas there was no effect in nondel(5q) AML cells. Small interfering RNA (shRNA) suppression of Cdc25C and PP2Acalpha gene expression recapitulated del(5q) susceptibility to lenalidomide with induction of G(2) arrest and apoptosis in both U937 and primary nondel(5q) MDS cells. These data establish a role for allelic haplodeficiency of the lenalidomide inhibitable Cdc25C and PP2Acalpha phosphatases in the selective drug sensitivity of del(5q) MDS.","['Wei, Sheng', 'Chen, Xianghong', 'Rocha, Kathy', 'Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'Liu, Qing', 'Byrd, John', 'Sokol, Lubomir', 'Lawrence, Nick', 'Pireddu, Roberta', 'Dewald, Gordon', 'Williams, Ann', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'List, Alan']","['Wei S', 'Chen X', 'Rocha K', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Djeu JY', 'Liu Q', 'Byrd J', 'Sokol L', 'Lawrence N', 'Pireddu R', 'Dewald G', 'Williams A', 'Maciejewski J', 'List A']","['Immunology Program and Malignant Hematology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA131076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA129952-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA131076-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129952/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA11211201-A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI056213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090526,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2CA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/08/27 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [medline]']","['0811267106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0811267106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Aug 4;106(31):12974-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0811267106.

Out of these, 136 genes were up-regulated and 150 down-regulated in early MDS compared to advanced MDS. Using clustering analysis those two patient categories were clearly differentiated. Further, we selected three genes (ADAM8, BIRC5, MPL) for gene expression validation by qRT-PCR in an additional set of 29 MDS and sAML patients. We confirmed decreasing trend for BIRC5 expression from early to advanced stages of MDS, with the lowest levels in sAML patients. On the contrary, higher ADAM8 and MPL expression was observed in most advanced MDS patients compared to the early MDS patients. Association between gene expression levels and bone marrow blast proportion was tested, but only BIRC5 expression showed negative correlation (r=-0.83 at p<0.001).

METHODS: Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. RESULTS: The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of leukemia due to occupational exposure is very low in Iran, although males are at greater risk than females.","['Mosavi-Jarrahi, Alireza', 'Mohagheghi, Mohammad Ali', 'Kalaghchi, Bita', 'Mousavi-Jarrahi, Yasaman', 'Kolahi, Ali Asghar', 'Noori, Mohammad Kazem']","['Mosavi-Jarrahi A', 'Mohagheghi MA', 'Kalaghchi B', 'Mousavi-Jarrahi Y', 'Kolahi AA', 'Noori MK']","['Dept. of Epidemiology, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services, Tehran, Iran. rmosavi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['J64922108F (Benzene)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)']",IM,"['Benzene/adverse effects', 'Ethylene Oxide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupations']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/08/27 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2009 Jan-Mar;10(1):67-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age-adjusted total cancer incidence rates per 100,000 population for the major ethnic groups represented on Guam were generally lower than U.S. averages (the exception was the Caucasian group which was higher). Some highlights include: 1). Chamorros (the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands) living on Guam had a slightly lower total cancer incidence rate than the total U.S. population (406.8/100,000 vs. 478.6 U.S.). Chamorros had high age-adjusted incidence rates for cancers of the mouth and pharynx (24.4 vs. U.S. 10.7), nasopharynx (13.9 vs. 0.6 U.S.), liver (13.2 vs. 5.2 U.S.), and cervix (16.2 vs. 9.6 U.S.).

Due to the high prevalence of consanguinity in Qatar (54%), its influence may nevertheless be of special importance. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine whether parental consanguinity affects the risk of cancer in a local Arab highly inbred population. DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING: The study was carried out in Al-Amal cancer hospital and primary health care centers in Qatar over a period from August 2008 to February 2009. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 370 Qataris and other Arab expatriates with various types of cancers and 635 controls matched by age and ethnicity. A questionnaire that included socio-demographic information, type of consanguinity, medical history, and tumor grade was designed to collect the information of cases and controls. RESULTS: The study revealed that the rate of parental consanguinity was similar in both cases (29.5%) and controls (29.9%) with a higher inbreeding coefficient in controls (0.017-/+0.03), compared to cancer patients (0.0155-/+0.03). Other Arab expatriates had a higher incidence of cancer (61.1%) than Qataris (38.9%). The inbreeding coefficient was higher in male cancer patients (0.0189-/+0.03), but lower in female cancer patients (0.014-/+0.03) as compared to controls. Controls were more inbred in the overall studied subjects (23.6%) and women (23.8%) than cases. The coefficient of inbreeding was lower in patients with breast (0.014), skin (0.012), thyroid (0.008) and female genital (0.014) cancers, whereas it was higher in cases for leukemia and lymphoma (0.018), colorectal (0.025) and prostate (0.017), with no significant difference between cases and controls. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls in the parental consanguinity, mean coefficient of inbreeding and proportion of more inbred subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings revealed that although the consanguinity rate is high in our Arab population, it has no effect on the incidence of cancers overall. However, there was an increased risk found for leukemia and lymphoma, colorectal and prostate cancer groups, but a reduced risk in breast, skin, thyroid and female genital cancer groups.","['Bener, Abdulbari', 'El Ayoubi, Hanadi R', 'Chouchane, Lotfi', 'Ali, Awab I', 'Al-Kubaisi, Aisha', 'Al-Sulaiti, Haya', 'Teebi, Ahmad S']","['Bener A', 'El Ayoubi HR', 'Chouchane L', 'Ali AI', 'Al-Kubaisi A', 'Al-Sulaiti H', 'Teebi AS']","['Dept. of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, Hamad Medical Corporation, Hamad General Hospital, Qatar. abener@hmc.org.qa']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adult', '*Consanguinity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Qatar/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/08/27 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/27 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2009 Jan-Mar;10(1):35-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective survey was performed at the haematology ward of the University Hospital of Brazzaville on files that were compiled from January 1st, 1994 to December 31st, 2004. RESULTS: 74 patients presenting Hypersplenism were identified, that were characterised by splenomegalia associated with multiple cytopenia of blood cells. This list of patients included 41 female and 33 male, with an overall average age of 34 years. The etiologic profile is established based on clinical and laboratory parameters. Thus, haemograms, liver enzymes, microbiology, histopathology, including or not spleenectomy were determined to establish the etiologic profile. Splenomegalia was often large and cytopenia was frequently severe. The profile shows a highest rate of lymphoproliferative disease (48 cases; 64.6%), including lymphomas and tricholeucocytic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Cirrhoses, hemoglobinopathies, and HIV infections were among the other causes of the disease. In spite of the disease. In spite of the risk associated with splenectomy, this surgical procedure enabled to establish diagnosis and allowed correction of the Hyperspleenism.

Many of them cannot be fed enterally, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is necessary. On the other hand, TPN is often not fully effective, and may be associated with various side effects and complications. We have assessed our practice by seeking the answers to three questions: (1) Was the TPN sufficient and adequate? (2) Did the TPN improve the nutritional status of patients? and (3) Were there any disease-dependent differences? METHODS: Seventy-one adult patients receiving TPN for at least 2 weeks, were allocated to five groups according to their underlying disease: A--patients after cardiovascular surgery, B--patients with acute pancreatitis, C--multiple trauma victims, D--patients after abdominal surgery; and E--septic or leukemic patients.The following parameters were assessed twice a week, in all cases: serum total protein, albumin, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and C-reactive protein, as well as nitrogen daily excretion and nitrogen balance. All patients were receiving ""all-in-one"" nutritional mixtures, consisting of amino acids, glucose, electrolytes, fat emulsion, vitamins and microelements. RESULTS: TPN increased serum total protein and serum albumin concentrations and improved nitrogen balance in all patients. Nutritional status also improved, regardless of underlying disease. Hyperglycemia was common, but glucose concentrations did not differ among the groups. There were no TPN-related complications. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, in the categories of patients studied, standard TPN is sufficient for improvement of nutritional status during life-threatening illness.","['Steffek, Mariusz', 'Owczuk, Radoslaw', 'Wujtewicz, Maria']","['Steffek M', 'Owczuk R', 'Wujtewicz M']",['Klinika Anestezjologii i Intensywnej Terapii AM w Gdansku. klanest@amg.gda.pl'],['pol'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Anestezjol Intens Ter,Anestezjologia intensywna terapia,9424972,,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/complications/surgery', 'Critical Care/*methods', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/etiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Trauma/complications', 'Pancreatitis/complications', '*Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Sepsis/complications', 'Stress, Psychological/complications']",2009/05/28 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/05/28 09:00'],"['2009/05/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Anestezjol Intens Ter. 2008 Apr-Jun;40(2):80-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,Ocena skutecznosci calkowitego zywienia pozajelitowego krytycznie chorych.,,,,,,,,,

We synthesized an organic arsenic derivative (OAD), S-dimethylarsino-thiosuccinic acid (MER1), which offers a superior toxicity profile and comparable in vitro activity relative to ATO. In Swiss Webster mice, maximally-tolerated cumulative dose of MER1 when given i.v. for 5 days was 100 mg/kg/d. We demonstrated that MER1 induced apoptosis and dose- and time-dependent inhibition of survival and growth in a panel of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Unlike ATO, this activity was independent of PML-RARalpha status and was not associated with induction of myeloid maturation. In NB4 and HL60 cells, MER1 and ATO induced caspase activation and dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. At the same time, MER1 induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and proved to be more potent than ATO at inducing apoptosis. ROS generation and intracellular glutathione levels were key modulators of MER1-induced cytotoxicity as evidenced by abrogation of apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines pretreated with the disulfide bond-reducing agent dithiothreitol or the radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Collectively, these data indicate that MER1 induces apoptosis in PML-RARalpha-positive and -negative myeloid leukemia cells by enhancing oxidative stress. This agent, therefore, combines low in vivo toxicity with formidable in vitro pro-apoptotic ROS-mediated activity, and may represent a novel OAD suitable for clinical development against a variety of hematological malignancies.","['Golemovic, Mirna', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Orsolic, Nada', 'Duzkale, Hatice', 'Johansen, Mary', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Zingaro, Ralph A', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Golemovic M', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Manshouri T', 'Orsolic N', 'Duzkale H', 'Johansen M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Zingaro RA', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The present study further demonstrates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in abundance in Jurkat leukemia cells upon AD5-10 stimulation and that ROS accumulation subsequently evoked sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of endonuclease G (Endo G) from mitochondria into the cytosol. The reducing agent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), effectively inhibited the sustained activation of JNK, release of Endo G, and cell death in Jurkat cells treated by AD5-10. Moreover, a dominant-negative form of JNK (but not of p38) enhanced NF-kappaB activation, suppressed caspase-8 recruitment in death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs), and reduced adverse effects on mitochondria, thereby inhibiting AD5-10-induced cell death in Jurkat leukemia cells.

A perspective in 2009.,135-9,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Kinase inhibitor therapy options for Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemias have rapidly developed and continue to expand. In 2001, imatinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and revolutionized the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); in 2006 and 2007, approval of dasatinib and nilotinib followed for use in imatinib-resistant or intolerant disease; additional kinase inhibitors continue in development to optimize toxicity and circumvent resistance. Decision-making regarding key questions of initial therapy choice, role of allografting, and changes in therapy remains a fluid discussion; this review aims to give a current perspective. RECENT FINDINGS: Imatinib remains a highly effective and well characterized choice for patients with CML in chronic phase; long-term toxicity continues to be assessed, and data surrounding stability of response are quite promising. Dasatinib and nilotinib have proven to be highly effective alternate approaches when imatinib is inadequate or intolerable, yet direct comparison in trials is lacking. Limited clinical and molecular data can aid in decision-making between these agents. SUMMARY: Multiple options exist today for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemias. Careful monitoring of response and categorization based on guidelines, utilization of molecular diagnostics, particularly kinase domain mutation analysis, as well as early review of allograft options, can allow for efficient and optimal management of the chronic phase CML patient.","['Mauro, Michael J']",['Mauro MJ'],"['Center for Hematologic Malignancies, OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA. maurom@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",2009/05/27 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/05/27 09:00'],"['2009/05/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257b2b [doi]', '00062752-200903000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Mar;16(2):135-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257b2b.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257b2b [doi],,,16,['Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Mar;16(2):63.

Unfortunately, the currently available modalities for postremission therapy, namely chemotherapy, have proven largely ineffective in changing the natural history of AML. The challenges to overcome therapeutic failure in the minimal residual disease status may relate to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and cell populations that are directly related to disease relapse as well as suboptimal ability to identify patients at highest risk for relapse. RECENT FINDINGS: Being a heterogeneous disease, relapsed AML is unlikely to emanate from one predominant mechanism; instead, there are likely multiple biologic factors at play that allow for clinical relapse to occur. These factors likely include multidrug resistance proteins, aberrant signal transduction pathways, survival of leukemia stem cells, microenvironmental interactions, and immune tolerance. Many novel strategies are in development that target these mechanisms, ranging from chemotherapeutic modalities, to signal transduction inhibitors, to upregulation of antileukemic immune responses.

However, prognostic markers cannot guide the decision for a specific treatment, as they are associated with a differential outcome regardless of the given treatment. In contrast, predictive markers indicate a treatment benefit in patients that are characterized through these markers. Thus, predictive markers can guide clinical decision-making. RECENT FINDINGS: In young adults, mutations of the nucleophosmin (gene 9NPM1) in the absence of concurrent FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (FLT3-ITD) have impressive prognostic and, beyond prognostication, predictive properties. This NPM1/FLT3-ITD genotype predicts equivalent favorable outcome after intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, whereas in the absence of this marker clinical outcome was significantly improved after an allogeneic transplantation. In addition, within a retrospective study performed on older adults, the same genotype predicted a significantly improved outcome if all-trans retinoic acid was added to intensive chemotherapy. SUMMARY: The discovery of new prognostic and predictive markers has increased our understanding of leukemogenesis and this may lead to improved prognostication and, more important, to novel genotype-specific treatment strategies.","['Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Schlenk RF', 'Dohner K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Germany. richard.schlenk@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/05/27 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/05/27 09:00'],"['2009/05/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257adb [doi]', '00062752-200903000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Mar;16(2):98-104. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257adb.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257adb [doi],,,57,['Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Mar;16(2):63.

Given the relatively good outcome of patients with CBF-AML, when treated with intensive chemotherapy including high-dose cytarabine, they are generally not considered as candidates for intensification with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the first complete remission. The optimal treatment strategy (place of stem cell transplantation, best postremission chemotherapy, role of targeted agents) remains, however, to be defined in these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The biological and prognostic heterogeneity of both CBF-AML subtypes, including gene mutation and gene expression profiles as well as molecular response to therapy, has been recently described.

However, the successful clinical application of differentiation therapy has only been realized since the late 1980s and only in one subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, both of which induce degradation of the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy/retinoic acid receptor alpha oncoprotein, in combination with chemotherapy is currently the accepted treatment of APL, presenting a potential paradigm for differentiation therapy in clinical oncology. RECENT FINDINGS: We have begun to understand why ATRA fails to induce differentiation in AML. The underlying reasons identified thus far are associated with an inability to target the removal of leukemogenic fusion proteins, aberrant epigenetic regulation of genes involved in the ATRA signaling pathway and the presence of factors that interfere with proper retinoic acid receptor alpha function. SUMMARY: Here, we examine the reasons why the exquisite sensitivity of APL to ATRA-based differentiation therapy has not been extended to other of AML subtypes. Current differentiation-based combinatorial approaches to target AML will also be analyzed. Finally, we will evaluate the potential of novel strategies, high-throughput screening, and functional genomics to uncover new differentiation-based therapies for AML.","['Petrie, Kevin', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Petrie K', 'Zelent A', 'Waxman S']","['Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2009/05/27 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/05/27 09:00'],"['2009/05/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257aee [doi]', '00062752-200903000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Mar;16(2):84-91. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257aee.,10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283257aee [doi],,,73,['Curr Opin Hematol. 2009 Mar;16(2):63.

The heterogeneous nature of MDS, and the paucity of randomized studies make individual therapeutic decisions, still largely based on the international prognostic scoring system, difficult.

In higher-risk patients, progress has come from the use of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic SCT in elderly patients, and from results obtained with the hypomethylating agents azacytidine and decitabine, leading to their approval for the treatment of symptomatic MDS by the Food and Drug Administration. In particular, results of a phase III trial show a significant survival benefit for azacytidine over conventional treatments in higher-risk MDS.

RECENT FINDINGS: Heightened awareness of the myelodysplastic syndrome burden has garnered rising interest in the development of new treatment strategies and investigation of the molecular basis of this complex disease. A multistep process explains the heterogeneity observed in myelodysplastic syndrome better than a single event, whereby multiple biological forces culminate in telomere erosion and genomic instability. Intrinsic genetic factors within myeloid progenitors along with extrinsic factors in the microenvironment may foster clonal selection. Specific targeted intervention at critical stages along this multistep pathway, prior to acute myeloid leukemia transformation, may produce the best clinical outcome.

We investigated its underlying mechanisms in 56 untreated patients with CLL. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) lymphocytic infiltration was estimated in trephine biopsies. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by ELISA. The potential of BM CD34+ to differentiate into erythroid cells was evaluated by methylcellulose-based assays and in liquid cultures supplemented with EPO, SCF, IL-3 +/- TNF-alpha. The response of erythroid precursors to EPO +/- TNF-alpha was assessed by detecting activated key proteins of EPO-EPO receptor signalling pathway using Western Blot and EMSA. RESULTS: Bone marrow lymphocytic infiltration was not exclusively responsible for disease-related anemia and CD34+ cells were intrinsically capable of generating erythroid precursors. Also, no deficiency of serum erythropoietin (EPO) or defective intracellular response of erythroid precursors to EPO +/- TNF-alpha stimulation was observed. Serum TNF-alpha levels were found increased in anemic CLL patients and TNF-alpha appeared to directly inhibit the erythroid development in early stages of erythropoiesis. CONCLUSION: We concluded that CLL-related anemia was not due to intrinsic defects of erythroid precursors, but might result from the direct suppressive effect of TNF-alpha on the erythroid production.","['Tsopra, Olga A', 'Ziros, Panos G', 'Lagadinou, Eleni D', 'Symeonidis, Argiris', 'Kouraklis-Symeonidis, Alexandra', 'Thanopoulou, Eleni', 'Angelopoulou, Maria K', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Pangalis, Gerassimos A', 'Zoumbos, Nicholas C']","['Tsopra OA', 'Ziros PG', 'Lagadinou ED', 'Symeonidis A', 'Kouraklis-Symeonidis A', 'Thanopoulou E', 'Angelopoulou MK', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Pangalis GA', 'Zoumbos NC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Division, University Medical School of Patras, Patras, Greece. olgatsopra@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090526,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications/physiopathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",2009/05/27 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/05/27 09:00'],"['2008/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['000220331 [pii]', '10.1159/000220331 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2009;121(4):187-95. doi: 10.1159/000220331.

In asynchronously dividing ALT-positive cell populations, a small fraction of the cells have ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (APBs), which contain (TTAGGG)n DNA and telomere-binding proteins. We found that restoring p53 function in ALT cells caused p21 up-regulation, growth arrest/senescence, and a large increase in cells containing APBs. Knockdown of p21 significantly reduced p53-mediated induction of APBs. Moreover, we found that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is present in APBs, and knockdown of HP1alpha and/or HP1gamma prevented p53-mediated APB induction, which suggests that HP1-mediated chromatin compaction is required for APB formation. Therefore, although the presence of APBs in a cell line or tumor is an excellent qualitative marker for ALT, the association of APBs with growth arrest/senescence and with ""closed"" telomeric chromatin, which is likely to repress recombination, suggests there is no simple correlation between ALT activity level and the number of APBs or APB-positive cells.","['Jiang, Wei-Qin', 'Zhong, Ze-Huai', 'Nguyen, Akira', 'Henson, Jeremy D', 'Toouli, Christian D', 'Braithwaite, Antony W', 'Reddel, Roger R']","['Jiang WQ', 'Zhong ZH', 'Nguyen A', 'Henson JD', 'Toouli CD', 'Braithwaite AW', 'Reddel RR']","[""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead 2145, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090525,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PCNP protein, human)', '0 (TERF2 protein, human)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/physiology', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/analysis/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/analysis', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/05/27 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/05/27 09:00'],"['2009/05/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']","['jcb.200810084 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200810084 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2009 Jun 1;185(5):797-810. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200810084.

In older patients, these disabilities can have an influence on the natural course of the malignant disease, on the tolerance to treatment and clinical decision making. Moreover caring of patients with several illnesses may generate high costs. To evaluate their incidence and their influence on treatment decisions, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 330 charts of patients treated for malignant diseases in the Department of Hematology at Saint Antoine Hospital during 2003 and 2004. The median age was 61 years. Forty percent of the patients were treated for lymphomas, mainly non-Hodgkin lymphomas; 16% for myelomas, 16% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 16% for a myeloproliferative disorder and 8% for acute leukemia. Comorbidities were present in 84% of the patients: hypertension in 35%, coronary disease in 16%, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 13%, renal failure, heart failure and arrhythmias in 10% respectively. Due to the presence of comorbidities, treatment was changed in 62/276 patients (22,46%). The diseases associated with a change were in a decreasing order: neurologic deficiency (out of stroke) (odds ratio [OR]: 4.86; 95% CI: [1.47-16.02]; P = 0.009), insulin-dependent diabetes (OR: 4.33; 95% CI: [1.40-13.31]; P = 0.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 3.33; 95% CI: [1.37-8.08]; P = 0.007), renal failure (OR: 3.07; 95% CI: [1.27-7.43]; P = 0.01), coronary disease (OR: 2.89; 95% CI: [1.30-6.42]; P = 0.009) and hypertension (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: [1.39-5.38]; P = 0.003).

There are currently several FLT3 inhibitors that are undergoing clinical investigation. However, the discovery of drug-resistant leukemic blast cells in FLT3 inhibitor-treated AML patients has prompted the search for novel, structurally diverse FLT3 inhibitors that could be alternatively used to circumvent drug resistance. Here, we provide an overview of FLT3 inhibitors under preclinical and clinical investigation, and we discuss mechanisms whereby AML cells develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and the ways in which combination therapy could potentially be utilized to override drug resistance. We discuss how the cross-talk between major downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK, and Jak/STAT, can be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting key signaling molecules with selective inhibitors, such as mTOR inhibitors, HSP90 inhibitors, or farnesyltransferase inhibitors, and identifying those agents with the ability to positively combine with inhibitors of FLT3, such as PKC412 and sunitinib. With the widespread onset of drug resistance associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, due to mechanisms involving development of point mutations or gene amplification of target proteins, the use of a multi-targeted therapeutic approach is of potential clinical benefit.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Barrett, Rosemary', 'Liu, Qingsong', 'Stone, Richard', 'Gray, Nathanael', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Barrett R', 'Liu Q', 'Stone R', 'Gray N', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

It is the culmination of the genetic profile of the leukemia, the individual patient, and molecular monitoring that has led to the earlier identification of patients who respond less favorably to treatment and thus prompts their treatment intensification and improved outcomes.

However, PAX2 expression was frequently identified in neoplasia responsible for the growth and survival of cancer cells. Due to alternative splicing of exon 6, exon 10 and exon 12 four isoforms of PAX2 are described so far. METHODS: The expression of an intron 9 containing PAX2 splice variant was analyzed in neoplastic B cell and solid tumor cell lines as well as in primary tumor samples by quantitative RT-PCR. PAX2 proteins were detected by Western Blot in a subset of cell lines. RESULTS: All 14 lymphoma cell lines expressed an undescribed PAX2 splice variant containing the entire intron 9 sequence and the exon 10 sequence. This splice variant could also be detected in 35 solid tumor cell lines, in leukemia and lymphoma as well as in colon carcinoma and melanoma patient samples and in blood samples of healthy donors. Expression of this new splice variant on protein level was verified by Western Blot analysis. CONCLUSION: We discovered a previously undescribed intron 9 and exon 10 containing splice variant of PAX2 in B-cell neoplasia and in solid tumors on mRNA and protein level.","['Busse, Antonia', 'Rietz, Anika', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Keilholz, Ulrich']","['Busse A', 'Rietz A', 'Schwartz S', 'Thiel E', 'Keilholz U']","['Department of Medicine III, Charite, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany. antonia.busse@charite.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090525,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Introns/*genetics', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/05/27 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/05/27 09:00'],"['2009/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-7-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-7-36 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2009 May 25;7:36. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-7-36.,10.1186/1479-5876-7-36 [doi],PMC2689858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, in seven of 65 samples (approximately 10%) of CLL, a minority of the leukaemic cells in the proliferation centres expressed cyclin D1. Cytogenetic analysis had been performed in three of seven cases and there was no evidence of translocation involving CCND1 locus. Our findings suggest that a small subset of CLL overexpresses cyclin D1 in amounts that can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry.

In recent years the zebrafish has emerged as an exciting new organism in which to model leukaemogenesis. The zebrafish model has distinct advantages over other animal models, most notably a capacity for forward genetic studies and rapid small molecule screens which can be used to dissect novel genetic pathways contributing to the development of leukaemia. Additionally, the high fecundity and optical clarity of the zebrafish make it an attractive organism in which to directly visualize the localization and development of normal and abnormal haematopoiesis in vivo. Until recently, targeting mutations to specific genes was technically difficult in the zebrafish, but new technology using chimeric zinc fingers to create targeted gene knockouts has made reverse genetic modelling possible and promises to deliver many new and exciting models. This review summarizes the benefits of using the zebrafish to study leukaemogenesis, reviews current zebrafish models of specific leukaemias, and gives an overview of future direction for the zebrafish in the study of cancer.","['Payne, Elspeth', 'Look, Thomas']","['Payne E', 'Look T']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.

However, there is no universally acceptable consensus on how to efficiently identify mutations in the target TKD. Recently, high-resolution melting (HRM) technology was developed, which allows gene scanning using an inexpensive generic heteroduplex-detecting dsDNA-binding dye. This study aimed to validate the introduction of HRM in a practical clinical setting for screening of mutations in sporadic sites of the chimerical bcr-abl TKD. All chimerical and wild-type abl TKD regions selectively amplified were used for HRM assays and direct sequencing. The HRM test had approximately 5-90% detection sensitivity for mutations. In contrast to mixture samples with mutant and wild-type cells, all mutant cell samples had indeterminate melting curves equivalent to those of the wild-type due to formation of only a homodulex. This issue was improved by the addition of exogenous wild-type DNA after PCR. Subsequently, HRM results gave a high accordance rate of 97.8% (44/45 samples) compared to the sequencing data. The discordant results in one appear to be due to unsuccessful amplification. Thus, HRM may be considered to be suitable for reliable scanning of mutations in the chimerical abl TKD in a clinical setting.","['Doi, Yuko', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Terada, Chiharu', 'Mori, Sayaka', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Matsuo, Emi', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Nagai, Kazuhiro', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Doi Y', 'Sasaki D', 'Terada C', 'Mori S', 'Tsuruda K', 'Matsuo E', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Nagai K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan. kamihira@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090523,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'U937 Cells']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/11/18 06:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0337-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0337-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Jul;90(1):37-43. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0337-y.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional prevalence study at the Discipline of Hematology, Hospital Sao Paulo, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo. METHODS: We investigated FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD+) in 40 adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), categorized according to cytogenetic results, from September 2001 to May 2005. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (32.5%) were classified as presenting the favorable karyotype, 11 patients (27.5%) as an intermediate group, 7 patients (17%) as an undefined group and 9 patients (22.5%) as the unfavorable group. FLT3/ITD+ was found in 10 patients (25%): 3 with FLT3/ITD+ and favorable karyotype; 4 with FLT3/ITD+ and intermediate karyotype; 2 with FLT3/ITD+ and undefined karyotype; and only 1 with FLT3/ITD+ and unfavorable karyotype. Among the patients without FLT3/ITD+, 10 presented favorable karyotype, 8 intermediate, 4 undefined and 8 unfavorable karyotype. The cytogenetic results showed no correlations between FLT3/ITD presence and the prognostic groups (P = 0.13). We found that 2 patients were still alive more than 24 months later, FLT3/ITD+ did not influence the patients' survival rate. CONCLUSION: We found the same frequency of AML with FLT3/ITD+ in both the favorable and intermediate prognosis groups. Only one patient presented AML, FLT3/ITD+ and unfavorable karyotype (the hypothetical worst clinical situation). Therefore, the prognostic advantage of favorable cytogenetics among patients with FLT3/ITD+ remains to be elucidated, for it to be better understood.","['Krum, Everson Augusto', 'Yamamoto, Mihoko', 'Chauffaille, Maria de Lourdes Lopes Ferrari']","['Krum EA', 'Yamamoto M', 'Chauffaille Mde L']","['Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa, Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,['EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2008/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1516-31802009000100006 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802009000100006 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2009 Jan;127(1):23-7. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802009000100006.,S1516-31802009000100006 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, studies concerning overweight have focused on acute lymphocytic leukemia and brain tumors, since they are at risk for hypothalamic-pituitary axis damage secondary to cancer therapies (cranial irradiation, chemotherapy, and brain surgery) or to primary tumor location. Obesity and cancer have metabolic syndrome features in common. Thus, it remains controversial if overweight is a cause or consequence of cancer, and to date additional mechanisms involving adipose tissue and hypothalamic derangements have been considered, comprising premature adiposity rebound, hyperinsulinemia, leptin regulation, and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with hematologic malignancy and pathologically proven secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis were identified from 2000 to 2007. Six had chest computed tomography scans, which were analyzed retrospectively; medical records were also reviewed. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 30 to 54 years. Four had chronic myelogenous leukemia, 1 had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 had cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. As in idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, geographic ground-glass opacities with or without septal thickening were most common (5/6). No axial or zonal predominance was present. Two patients died from respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis as a cause of geographic ground-glass opacities and septal thickening in a patient with hematologic malignancy. Whereas idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis has a low mortality rate, the death of 2 of our 6 patients implies that secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may have a worse prognosis. Our case of secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is the first described in the literature.","['Chung, Jonathan H', 'Pipavath, Sudhakar J', 'Myerson, David H', 'Godwin, David']","['Chung JH', 'Pipavath SJ', 'Myerson DH', 'Godwin D']","['Department of Radiology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. jchung2@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Thorac Imaging,Journal of thoracic imaging,8606160,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/09/16 06:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/RTI.0b013e3181930ed6 [doi]', '00005382-200905000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Imaging. 2009 May;24(2):115-8. doi: 10.1097/RTI.0b013e3181930ed6.,10.1097/RTI.0b013e3181930ed6 [doi],PMC2742334,['NIHMS85818'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of apoptosis in cancerous cells has been proposed to be the underlying mechanism for the therapeutic efficacy of arsenic. To further understand the cytotoxicity of arsenic compounds in APL cells, HL-60 cells were exposed to graded concentrations of the following arsenicals for up to 48 h: arsenic trioxide (As(III)), sodium arsenate (As(V)), phenylarsine oxide (PAO(III)), monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)), and the viability and modes of cell death assessed. The arsenic-exposed cells were stained with annexin V-PE and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) and analyzed by flow cytometry in order to detect apoptotic and viable cells while cell morphology was visualized using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Acridine orange staining and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP-LC3) detection were used to recognize autophagic cell death. The results showed that the compounds reduced viable HL-60 cells by inducing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner.

An increase in caspase-3 activity by PAO(III), MMA(III) and DMA(V) implied that these compounds induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through a caspase-dependent mechanism, but the other arsenic compounds failed to activate caspase-3, suggesting that they induce apoptosis by an alternative pathway.","['Charoensuk, Vichaya', 'Gati, Wendy P', 'Weinfeld, Michael', 'Le, X Chris']","['Charoensuk V', 'Gati WP', 'Weinfeld M', 'Le XC']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090522,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/08/12 09:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/12 09:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(09)00207-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2009 Aug 15;239(1):64-70. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.05.016.

These include leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, male breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and cancers of the brain, stomach, colon, rectum, prostate, urinary bladder, testes, and thyroid. Firefighters are exposed to a long list of recognized or probable carcinogens in combustion products and the presumed route of exposure to these carcinogens is by inhalation. Curiously, respiratory system cancers and diseases are usually not increased in firefighters as they are in workers exposed to known inhaled carcinogens. The list of cancers with increased risk in firefighters strongly overlaps the list of cancers at increased risk in workers exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and radiofrequency radiation (RFR). Firefighters have increased exposure to RFR in the course of their work, from the mobile two-way radio communications devices which they routinely use while fighting fires, and at times from firehouse and fire vehicle radio transmitters. I suggest that some of the increased cancer risk in firefighters is caused by RFR exposure, and is therefore preventable. The precautionary principle should be applied to reduce the risk of cancer in firefighters, and workman's compensation rules will necessarily need to be modified.","['Milham, S']",['Milham S'],"['Washington State Department of Health (retired) Olympia Washington, USA. smilham2@comcast.net']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090522,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Carcinogens/*toxicity', '*Fires', 'Humans', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', '*Radio Waves']",2009/05/26 09:00,2010/01/05 06:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2009/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(09)00288-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2009.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2009 Nov;73(5):788-9. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.04.020.

Initially described as a combination of pancytopenia with a limited number of physical anomalies, it was later recognized that additional features were compatible with the FA phenotype, including a form without detectable malformations (Estren-Dameshek variant). The discovery of somatic mosaicism extended the boundaries of the FA phenotype to cases even without any overt hematological manifestations. This clinical heterogeneity was augmented by new conceptualizations. There was the realization of a constant risk for the development of myelodysplasia and certain malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma, and there was the emergence of a distinctive cellular phenotype. A striking degree of genetic heterogeneity became apparent with the delineation of at least 12 complementation groups and the identification of their underlying genes. Although functional genetic insights have fostered the interpretation of many phenotypic features, surprisingly few stringent genotype-phenotype connections have emerged. In addition to myriad genetic alterations, less predictable influences are likely to modulate the FA phenotype, including modifier genes, environmental factors and chance effects. In reviewing the current status of genotype-phenotype correlations, we arrive at a unifying hypothesis to explain the remarkably wide range of FA phenotypes. Given the large body of evidence that genomic instability is a major underlying mechanism of accelerated ageing phenotypes, we propose that the numerous FA variants can be viewed as differential modulations and compression in time of intrinsic biological ageing.","['Neveling, Kornelia', 'Endt, Daniela', 'Hoehn, Holger', 'Schindler, Detlev']","['Neveling K', 'Endt D', 'Hoehn H', 'Schindler D']","['Department of Human and Medical Genetics, University of Wurzburg, Biozentrum, Am Hubland, Wurzburg D-97074, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090521,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'DNA Repair', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', '*Genomic Instability', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Progeria/genetics', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(09)00168-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 Jul 31;668(1-2):73-91. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.05.006.

Previously we observed enhanced degradation of Akt in P388D1 moncocyte/macrophages following treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) or 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In the present report we examine the role of the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway in this process. We show that treatment with 25-OH or 7-KC results in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated Akt, an effect that is enhanced by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Modification of Akt by the addition of a Gly-Ala repeat (GAr), a domain known to block ubiquitin-dependent targeting of proteins to the proteasome, resulted in a chimeric protein that is resistant to turn-over induced by 25-OH or 7-KC and provides protection from apoptosis induced by these oxysterols. These results uncover a new aspect of oxysterol regulation of Akt in macrophages; oxysterol-stimulated poly-ubiquitination of Akt and degradation by the proteasomal pathway.","['Liu, June', 'Netherland, Courtney', 'Pickle, Theresa', 'Sinensky, Michael S', 'Thewke, Douglas P']","['Liu J', 'Netherland C', 'Pickle T', 'Sinensky MS', 'Thewke DP']","['Department of Urology, University of Pittsburg School of Medicine, Pittsburg, PA 15232, USA.']",['eng'],"['R15 HL085137/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 HL085137-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL085137/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090521,United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Ketocholesterols)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '767JTD2N31 (25-hydroxycholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'O7676FE78M (7-ketocholesterol)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hydroxycholesterols/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ketocholesterols/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2008/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9861(09)00150-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2009.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2009 Jul 1;487(1):54-8. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2009.05.004.

For Hsp90 inhibition, we used geldanamycin derivates, 17-AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) and 17-DMAG (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino) 17-demethoxygeldanamycin) in this study. The inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 17-AAG in an ATL cell line, designated as TaY, and two HTLV-1 transformed cell lines (MT-2 and MT-4) was 300-700 nM, and that of 17-DMAG was 150-200nM. Fresh ATL cells obtained from patients were more sensitive to both 17-AAG and 17-DMAG. Gene expression analysis of TaY cells revealed up-regulation of HSPA1A encoding Hsp70, a hallmark of Hsp90 inhibition. Genes regulating cell proliferation or anti-apoptosis (i.e. BCL2 and BIRC5), genes related to cytokines or chemokines (i.e. IL9 and CCL27), and notably TCF7L2, a down-stream effecter of beta-catenin were remarkably down-regulated. Down-regulation of TCF7L2 mRNA was noted in the three cell lines and two patient specimens after Hsp90 inhibition. Hsp90 inhibitors dephosphorylate AKT, thereby, activate GSK-3beta, which phosphorylates beta-catenin for ubiquitination. This indicates the possibility that beta-catenin/TCF7L2 pathway plays an important role in Hsp90 inhibitor-induced cell death in ATL cells and HTLV-1 transformed cells. Our results have provided new insights into the complex molecular pharmacology of Hsp90 inhibitors, and suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors might be beneficial as anti-proliferative agents in treating ATL patients.","['Kurashina, Ryosuke', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Hamamura, Ryoko', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Hirano, Toshihiko', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Kurashina R', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Kobayashi C', 'Hamamura R', 'Zhang Y', 'Hirano T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090521,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TCF Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2008/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00270-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2009 Oct 18;284(1):62-70. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.04.012.

The expression of miR-143 was up-regulated during the apoptosis with time. The increased expression of miR-143 emerged from 1 to 2h after the treatment, at which time the caspases-8 and -3 were also activated; and this increase was almost canceled by the pretreatment with an inhibitor of caspase-3 or -8. Furthermore, the transfection of Jurkat cells with mature miR-143 induced a significant growth suppression and enhancement of CH-11-induced apoptosis. On the contrary, an extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 (ERK5), which was determined to be a target of miR-143 in colon cancer DLD-1 cells, was time-dependently down-regulated at the translational level after the treatment. During the apoptosis, the expression level of FasL was maintained and the level of nuclear-Foxo3a was increased in the early phase.

The more definite mechanisms by which GO exerts its cell death-inducing propensity, and thus how sensitivity and resistance to GO are regulated, still remain to be elucidated. We have studied proapoptotic signaling events induced by GO and free calicheamicin in AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML cell lines and primary blood cells from six patients with acute leukemia were incubated with GO or calicheamicin and the effects on cell viability and proapoptotic signaling were analyzed using MTT assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. RESULTS: GO and free calicheamicin at clinically relevant concentrations resulted in decreased cell viability, appearance of apoptotic morphology, depolarization of mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3 signaling in HL60 and NB4 AML cells. In contrast, none of these events were observed in GO-exposed KG1a AML cells. Notably, GO treatment also caused proapoptotic conformation of Bak and Bax and activation of stress-activated protein kinase p38 in responsive but not in resistant AML cells. In patient-derived AML cells, GO and calicheamicin induced a heterogeneous cytotoxic response, partly linked to CD33 expression and with signs of caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSION: Our novel data on GO-induced proapoptotic activation of Bax, Bak, and stress-activated protein kinase indicate an important role for these signal proteins in the regulation of GO sensitivity in AML.","['Haag, Petra', 'Viktorsson, Kristina', 'Lindberg, Marita Lagergren', 'Kanter, Lena', 'Lewensohn, Rolf', 'Stenke, Leif']","['Haag P', 'Viktorsson K', 'Lindberg ML', 'Kanter L', 'Lewensohn R', 'Stenke L']","['Karolinska Biomics Center, Department of Oncology/Pathology, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2008/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00080-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jun;37(6):755-66. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.03.002.,10.1016/j.exphem.2009.03.002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the finding that an Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) gene mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) was observed in approximately 15% of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), we investigated synergistic leukemogenesis effects of the two genes in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line, 32Dc, expression of MLL-AF4 and mutant Flt3 was induced using a lentiviral vector. We analyzed apoptosis induction in the absence of IL-3 and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-related induction of differentiation, gene expression profiling, and the mechanism involved in the synergistic effects of MLL-AF4 and Flt3-TKD. RESULTS: Neither Flt3-expressing 32Dc (32Dc(Flt3-TKD)) nor MLL-AF4-expressing 32Dc (32Dc(MLL-AF4)) acquired IL-3-independent proliferative capacity in semisolid/liquid media. However, Flt3-TKD+MLL-AF4-expressing 32Dc (32Dc(Flt3-TKD+MLL-AF4)) acquired a non-IL-3-dependent proliferative capacity by inhibiting apoptosis in the two media. The 32Dc(Flt3-TKD) and 32Dc(MLL-AF4) cells differentiated into granulocytes in the presence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. However, in the 32Dc(Flt3-TKD+MLL-AF4) cells, there was no differentiation. Subsequently, we performed gene expression profiling. The enhancement of Hox genes expression was not identified. However, expression of S100A6 was synergistically enhanced in the presence of both MLL-AF4 and Flt3-TKD genes. Moreover, anti-S100A6 small interfering RNA downregulated leukemic proliferation. CONCLUSION: We conclude that their synergistic enhancement of S100A6 expression plays an important role in MLL-AF4-associated leukemogenesis.","['Yamaguchi, Hiroki', 'Hanawa, Hideki', 'Uchida, Naoya', 'Inamai, Mitsuharu', 'Sawaguchi, Kazuhiro', 'Mitamura, Yoshio', 'Shimada, Takashi', 'Dan, Kazuo', 'Inokuchi, Koiti']","['Yamaguchi H', 'Hanawa H', 'Uchida N', 'Inamai M', 'Sawaguchi K', 'Mitamura Y', 'Shimada T', 'Dan K', 'Inokuchi K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, Japan. y-hiroki@fd6.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100a6 protein, mouse)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6', 'S100 Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2008/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00055-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Jun;37(6):701-14. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.02.007.,10.1016/j.exphem.2009.02.007 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of combining PTK787/ZK 222584 with a chemotherapeutic agent, such as Idarubicin, for treatment of AML. We have analyzed in four AML cell lines and seven AML patient samples, cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis. and activation of several related intracellular pathways after treatment with PTK787/ZK 222584 alone or combined with Idarubicin. PTK787/ZK 222584 decreased VEGF levels and VEGF receptor phosphorylation in the AML cells showing Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3/internal tandem duplication mutation (Flt3/ITD). Both drugs, given separately, inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, combined treatment promoted more apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation than each compound administered separately in all AML cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frequent MRD monitoring was performed in all AML treatment phases using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for fusion transcripts (CBFB/MYH11; RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts of MLL gene) and for the Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene. A total of 2,664 samples, taken from 79 AML patients and 6 healthy volunteers, were examined. Presence of fusion gene was detected in 25 of 79 examined patients. RESULTS: Vast correlation was discovered for fusion transcripts as well as for the WT1 gene between levels in bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, CD34(+) BM cells, and CD34(-) BM cells. WT1 expression, however, was usually positive for cases showing fusion transcripts negativity and in healthy volunteers. Moreover, no universal value of the WT1 expression could unequivocally discriminate between remission and relapse. Therefore, detection of molecular relapses relied on fusion transcripts only and was characterized by strong expression in CD34(+) cells. Considering relapsed patients, duration from molecular to hematological relapse was 8 to 79 days (median: 25.5 days). Twelve patients were treated (chemotherapy, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, or immunomodulation after allogeneic transplantation) for 21 molecular relapses and 14 responses to treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent quantitative monitoring of fusion transcripts is useful for reliably predicting hematological relapse in AML patients.

OBJECTIVE: The roles of autoimmunity and the molecular mimicry was evaluated in TSP/HAM patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were characterized from patients in the Pacific coastal region of Colombia. Thirty-seven were identified as TSP/HAM, 10 were diagnosed with adult T-cell leukemia virus, 22 were asymptomatic carriers but seropositive for HTLV-I and 20 were seronegative and served as negative controls. Plasmatic levels of the following were determined: antinuclear antibody (ANA) levels, anticardiolipine-2 (ACL-2), interferon- (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Using Western blot, the crossreactivity of the seropositive and seronegative samples was evaluated against proteins extracted from several central nervous system components of non infected Wistar rats. The HTLV-I seropositive plasmas were crossreacted with a monoclonal tax (LT4 anti-taxp40) from spinal cord neurons of non infected Wistar rats. RESULTS: Of the TSP/HAM patients, 70.2% were reactive against ANA and 83.8% against ACL-2, in contrast with those ATL and asymptomatic seropositives subjects that were not reactive (P<0.001). Moreover, 70.3% had detectable levels of IFN and 43.2% had detectable IL-4. LT4 anti-taxp40 and plasma of TSP/HAM exhibited cross reactivity with a MW 33-35 kDa protein from the rat spinal cord nuclei. CONCLUSION: Support was provided for the existence of an autoimmune syndrome mediated by molecular mimicry; the syndrome was responsible for some of the axonal degeneration observed in TSP/HAM patients.","['Dominguez, Martha C', 'Torres, Miyerlandi', 'Tamayo, Oscar', 'Criollo, William', 'Quintana, Milton', 'Sanchez, Adalberto', 'Garcia, Felipe']","['Dominguez MC', 'Torres M', 'Tamayo O', 'Criollo W', 'Quintana M', 'Sanchez A', 'Garcia F']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular y Patogenesis, Departamento de Ciencias Fisiologicas, Escuela de Ciencias Basicas, Facultad de Salud, Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/blood/immunology', '*Autoimmune Diseases/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*HTLV-I Infections/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Mimicry', '*Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Spinal Cord/pathology']",2009/05/26 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/05/26 09:00'],"['2009/05/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']",['S0120-41572008000400005 [pii]'],ppublish,Biomedica. 2008 Dec;28(4):510-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,Sindrome autoinmune en la paraparesia tropical espastica/mielopatia asociada a la infeccion por el virus linfotropico humano tipo I de la costa pacifica colombiana.,,,,,,,,,

We observed that both human and murine lung cancer cell lines secrete more MVs in response to non-apoptotic doses of hypoxia and irradiation. These tumor-derived (t)MVs activate and chemoattract stroma fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Furthermore, they induce expression of several pro-angiopoietic factors in stromal cells such as IL-8, VEGF, LIF, OSM, IL-11 and MMP-9. We also noticed that conditioned media harvested from stroma cells stimulated by tMVs enhanced the metastatic potential of both human and murine lung cancer cells in vivo.

Mechanisms regulating INK4/ARF expression are not fully characterized. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that in young proliferating embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2 together with PRC1 members BMI1 and M33 are strongly expressed and localized at the INK4/ARF regulatory domain (RD) identified as a DNA replication origin. When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This loss is accompanied with an increased expression of the histone demethylase Jmjd3 and with the recruitment of the MLL1 protein, and correlates with the expression of the Ink4a/Arf genes. Moreover, we show that the Polycomb protein BMI1 interacts with CDC6, an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Polycomb proteins and associated epigenetic marks are crucial for the control of the replication timing of the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the replication licencing factor CDC6 as a new partner of the Polycomb group member BMI1. Our results suggest that in young cells Polycomb proteins are recruited to the INK4/ARF locus through CDC6 and the resulting silent locus is replicated during late S-phase. Upon senescence, Jmjd3 is overexpressed and the MLL1 protein is recruited to the locus provoking the dissociation of Polycomb from the INK4/ARF locus, its transcriptional activation and its replication during early S-phase. Together, these results provide a unified model that integrates replication, transcription and epigenetics at the INK4/ARF locus.","['Agherbi, Hanane', 'Gaussmann-Wenger, Anne', 'Verthuy, Christophe', 'Chasson, Lionel', 'Serrano, Manuel', 'Djabali, Malek']","['Agherbi H', 'Gaussmann-Wenger A', 'Verthuy C', 'Chasson L', 'Serrano M', 'Djabali M']","[""Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille Luminy, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090520,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CDC6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Replication Timing', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/05/23 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/05/23 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005622 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 May 20;4(5):e5622. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005622.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005622 [doi],PMC2680618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central node in PI3K downstream signalling is controlled by the serine-threonine kinase AKT1. A somatic mutation affecting residue E17 of the AKT1 gene has recently been identified in breast and colon cancer. The E17K change results in constitutive AKT1 activation, induces leukaemia in mice, and accordingly, may be therapeutically exploited to target the PI3K pathway. Assessing whether AKT1 is activated by somatic mutations in GBM is relevant to establish its role in this aggressive disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic mutational analysis of the complete coding sequence of the AKT1 gene in a panel of 109 tumor GBM samples and nine high grade astrocytoma cell lines. However, no somatic mutations were detected in the coding region of AKT1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that in GBM oncogenic deregulation of the PI3K pathway does not involve somatic mutations in the coding region of AKT1.","['Bleeker, Fonnet E', 'Lamba, Simona', 'Zanon, Carlo', 'van Tilborg, Angela A', 'Leenstra, Sieger', 'Troost, Dirk', 'Hulsebos, Theo', 'Vandertop, W Peter', 'Bardelli, Alberto']","['Bleeker FE', 'Lamba S', 'Zanon C', 'van Tilborg AA', 'Leenstra S', 'Troost D', 'Hulsebos T', 'Vandertop WP', 'Bardelli A']","['Neurosurgical Center Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. f.e.bleeker@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090520,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)'],IM,"['Female', 'Glioblastoma/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics']",2009/05/23 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/05/23 09:00'],"['2008/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005638 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 May 20;4(5):e5638. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005638.,10.1371/journal.pone.0005638 [doi],PMC2680963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also provide additional evidence supporting the notion that IL2RG and LMO2 cooperate in leukemia induction but are not sufficient and require additional cooperating mutations. The highly concordant nature of the genetic events giving rise to mouse and human leukemias with mutations at Lmo2 are an encouraging sign to those wanting to use mice to model human cancer and may help in designing safer methods for retroviral gene therapy.","['Dave, Utpal P', 'Akagi, Keiko', 'Tripathi, Rati', 'Cleveland, Susan M', 'Thompson, Mary A', 'Yi, Ming', 'Stephens, Robert', 'Downing, James R', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G']","['Dave UP', 'Akagi K', 'Tripathi R', 'Cleveland SM', 'Thompson MA', 'Yi M', 'Stephens R', 'Downing JR', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. utpal.dave@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['1K08HL089403-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA009385-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY08126/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL089403-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY008126/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL089403/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK58404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090522,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL2RG protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Virus Integration/genetics', 'X-Linked Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases/complications/genetics/*therapy']",2009/05/23 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/05/23 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pgen.1000491 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2009 May;5(5):e1000491. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000491.

Multiple operative and nonoperative treatments have been explored in the pediatric patient population, and core decompression is a relatively safe and possibly effective option. To optimize core decompression further, we have tested a new technique involving thorough decompression of the osteonecrotic zone under endoscopic visualization (TDEV) combined with cancellous bone grafting and stabilization with a nail plate device. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 16 hips in 13 patients (< or =20 years old) with femoral head osteonecrosis related to steroid treatment, sickle cell anemia, or leukemia. The Steinberg classification system was used to classify all cases. Each patient underwent TDEV, bone grafting, and stabilization of the grafting site. Patients were followed up postoperatively for changes in pain level, functional ability, and Steinberg radiologic stage. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 28 months (range, 18-49 months). All patients in whom the procedure was successful had improvement in pain symptoms at latest follow-up, except for 1. Radiologically, all Steinberg stage II cases (B and C), except for 1, demonstrated good incorporation of graft without further progression of disease. Seven of the 8 patients that showed radiologic progression and deterioration of function or progressive symptoms had grade IIIB disease or higher at the time of procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial results demonstrate that TDEV combined with cancellous bone grafting and stabilization produces encouraging early results for pediatric patients with lesions graded lower than Steinberg stage IIIB. Our findings were less optimistic for patients with higher-grade lesions. Our recommendation, therefore, is to use TDEV by trained surgeons for treatment of early-stage lesions, preferably less than Steinberg stage IIIB.

We report the use of two single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based techniques to determine 13q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status in 15 patients with CLL: (i) digital SNP (dSNP), where analysis of heterozygous SNPs detects allelic imbalances, and (ii) DNA sequencing, where LOH is identified by comparison of allelic peak heights in normal and neoplastic cells. The SNP-based techniques were compared with established molecular techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, to determine their utility and relative sensitivity. dSNP proved to be the most sensitive technique, identifying 13q14 LOH in 11 of 13 (85%) patients (95% CI: 55%, 98%) without the need for neoplastic cell enrichment. Three cases showed evidence of LOH by dSNP that was not apparent by other techniques. In 8 of 13 (62%) cases, partial or interstitial patterns of LOH were observed by dSNP. Our findings demonstrate that dSNP represents a useful, sensitive technique for the analysis of chromosomal aberrations that result in LOH.

As in multivariate analysis all these parameters maintained their discriminating power (mutational status of IgV(H,)P < 0.0001; soluble CD26, P = 0.02) their combined effect on clinical outcome was assessed. When three groups were considered: (1) Low-risk group (n = 31), patients with concordant IgVH(mut) and low level of soluble CD26; (2) intermediate risk group (n = 26), patients with discordant pattern; (3) high-risk group (n = 12), patients with concordant IgVH(unmut) and high level of soluble CD26, differences in the TFT were statistically significant, with a TFT at 5 yr of respectively 88%, 51% and 43% (P < 0.0001). Our results indicate that in early B-cell CLL biological profile including among other parameters soluble CD26 may provide a useful insight into the complex interrelationship of prognostic variables. Furthermore, CD26 along with mutational status of IgV(H) can be adequately used to predict clinical behavior of patients with low risk disease.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Digiesi, Giovanna', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Antenucci, Anna', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Sperduti, Isabella', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Baldini, Luca', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Molica S', 'Digiesi G', 'Mirabelli R', 'Cutrona G', 'Antenucci A', 'Molica M', 'Giannarelli D', 'Sperduti I', 'Morabito F', 'Neri A', 'Baldini L', 'Ferrarini M']","['Medical Oncology Unit, Hematology-Oncology Department, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Viale Pio X - 88100 Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090502,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Aged', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*biosynthesis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",2009/05/23 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/05/23 09:00'],"['2009/05/23 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1273 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01273.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Sep;83(3):208-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01273.x.

PROCEDURE: Rates of self-reported thyroid dysfunction and thyroid cancer were determined among 3,579 ALL survivors participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with 3,846 siblings and population rates, respectively. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of hypo- and hyperthyroidism among survivors 15 years following leukemia diagnosis was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1, 2.1) and 0.6% (95% CI 0.3, 1.1), respectively, both significantly increased compared with siblings. In multivariate analysis, survivors who received >or=20 Gy cranial radiotherapy plus any spinal radiotherapy had the highest risk of subsequent hypothyroidism (HR 8.3, 95% CI 3.3, 20.5) compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone. Craniospinal radiotherapy also was associated with an increased risk of subsequent hyperthyroidism (HR 6.1, 95% CI 1.1, 34.2) compared with chemotherapy alone, as well as an increased risk of subsequent thyroid cancers (SIR 30.3, 95% CI 14.5, 55.7) compared with population rates. In radiation dosimetry analysis, pituitary doses >or=20 Gy combined with thyroid doses >or=10 Gy were associated with hypothyroidism, whereas pituitary doses >or=20 Gy combined with thyroid doses >or=15 Gy were associated with hyperthyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid cancer was increased among childhood ALL survivors treated with craniospinal radiotherapy. In these individuals, long-term surveillance is warranted as no obvious plateau in risk was seen, even after 25 years of follow-up.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Whitton, John A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Sklar, Charles A']","['Chow EJ', 'Friedman DL', 'Stovall M', 'Yasui Y', 'Whitton JA', 'Robison LL', 'Sklar CA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'Thyroid Diseases/*etiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*etiology']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22082 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Sep;53(3):432-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22082.,10.1002/pbc.22082 [doi],PMC2713362,['NIHMS108352'],,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analysed data obtained from a population-based case-control study conducted in seven Canadian provinces. Risk estimates were generated by applying multivariate logistic regression methods to 653 incident histologically confirmed leukemia cases and 3,106 controls aged 20-74. RESULTS: We observed a 25% risk reduction for adult leukemia associated with the highest category of vigorous physical activity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.99). This reduction was stronger among men (OR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.41-0.95), than among women (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.52-1.29). For women, reduced risk estimates were observed for all levels of vigorous activity; for men, reduced risk estimates were restricted to the highest category of vigorous activity High levels of vigorous activity were associated with some degree of risk reduction for each of the five histological subtypes except chronic myeloid leukemia. Risk reductions associated with high levels of vigorous activity were more pronounced with higher body mass index (BMI): BMI < 25 (OR 0.93; 95% CI = 0.61-1.40); BMI > 25 to <30 (OR 0.75; 95% CI = 0.40-1.21); BMI > or = 30 (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.28-0.95).

We found that inhibition of KSP by a selective inhibitor, ARRY-520, blocked cell cycle progression, leading to apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines that express high levels of KSP. Knockdown of p53, overexpression of XIAP and mutation in caspase-8 did not significantly affect sensitivity to ARRY-520, suggesting that the response is independent of p53, XIAP and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although ARRY-520 induced mitotic arrest in both HL-60 and Bcl-2-overexpressing HL-60Bcl-2 cells, cell death was blunted in HL-60Bcl-2 cells, suggesting that the apoptotic program is executed through the mitochondrial pathway. Accordingly, inhibition of Bcl-2 by ABT-737 was synergistic with ARRY-520 in HL-60Bcl-2 cells. Furthermore, ARRY-520 increased Bim protein levels prior to caspase activation in HL-60 cells. ARRY-520 significantly inhibited tumor growth of xenografts in SCID mice and inhibited AML blast but not normal colony formation, supporting a critical role for KSP in proliferation of leukemic progenitor cells. These results demonstrate that ARRY-520 potently induces cell cycle block and subsequent death in leukemic cells via the mitochondrial pathway and has the potential to eradicate AML progenitor cells.","['Carter, B Z', 'Mak, D H', 'Woessner, R', 'Gross, S', 'Schober, W D', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Andreeff, M']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak DH', 'Woessner R', 'Gross S', 'Schober WD', 'Estrov Z', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090521,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KIF11 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '8A49OSO368 (filanesib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Thiadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009101 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.101 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1755-62. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.101.

We isolated and characterized an HUCB-derived population of progenitors (HUCBNP), differentiated toward neuronal phenotype by human neuroblastoma-conditioning medium (CM) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which have been found to confer neuroprotection toward hypoxia-mediated neuronal injury. This study investigated whether interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) contributes to HUCBNP differentiation. IFN-gamma was detected in the CM used for the induction of differentiation of HUCBNP and a neutralizing antibody of IFN-gamma significantly inhibited either IFN-gamma or CM-induced differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of CM-differentiated HUCBNP, identified 86 genes as highly upregulated, among them 25 were IFN-induced (such as 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 and 2, IFN-induced protein and transmembrane proteins, STAT1 (IFN-gamma-receptor signal transducer and activator of transcription) and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 5). Treatment of HUCBNP with human recombinant IFN-gamma, inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-gamma (1-100 ng/ml) enhanced neuronal differentiation, expressed by neurite outgrowths and increased expression of the neuronal markers beta-tubulin III, microtubule-associated protein 2, neuronal nuclei, neurofilament M and neuronal-specific enolase. IFN-gamma additively cooperated with NGF to induce the differentiation of HUCBNP. These data indicate that IFN-gamma promotes neuronal differentiation of HUCB-derived progenitors, proposing its use in future protocols towards cell therapy.","['Arien-Zakay, H', 'Lecht, S', 'Bercu, M M', 'Amariglio, N', 'Rechavi, G', 'Galski, H', 'Lazarovici, P', 'Nagler, A']","['Arien-Zakay H', 'Lecht S', 'Bercu MM', 'Amariglio N', 'Rechavi G', 'Galski H', 'Lazarovici P', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090521,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/genetics/metabolism"", 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009106 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.106 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1790-800. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.106.

Topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) is the major decatenating enzyme. Topo IIalpha inhibitors prevent decatenation, causing cells to arrest during mitosis. Here we report that acute myeloid leukemia cells fail to arrest at the mitotic decatenation checkpoint, and their progression through this checkpoint is regulated by the DNA repair component Metnase (also termed SETMAR). Metnase contains a SET histone methylase and transposase nuclease domain, and is a component of the nonhomologous end-joining DNA double-strand break repair pathway. Metnase interacts with Topo IIalpha and enhances its decatenation activity. Here we show that multiple types of acute leukemia cells have an attenuated mitotic arrest when decatenation is inhibited and that in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line this is mediated by Metnase. Of further importance, Metnase permits continued proliferation of these AML cells even in the presence of the clinical Topo IIalpha inhibitor VP-16. In vitro, purified Metnase prevents VP-16 inhibition of Topo IIalpha decatenation of tangled DNA. Thus, Metnase expression levels may predict AML resistance to Topo IIalpha inhibitors, and Metnase is a potential therapeutic target for small molecule interference.","['Wray, Justin', 'Williamson, Elizabeth A', 'Sheema, Sheema', 'Lee, Suk-Hee', 'Libby, Edward', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Nickoloff, Jac A', 'Hromas, Robert']","['Wray J', 'Williamson EA', 'Sheema S', 'Lee SH', 'Libby E', 'Willman CL', 'Nickoloff JA', 'Hromas R']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Cancer Research and Treatment Center, Department of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 S10 RR14668/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR19287/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR11830/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019287/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075783/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084020/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR016918/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090520,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETMAR protein, human)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mitosis', 'Models, Biological']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37011-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-175760 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Aug 27;114(9):1852-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-175760.

The mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is thought to positively regulate eIF4F assembly and subsequent oncogenic protein synthesis through 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. We showed here that the translation inhibitor 4EGI-1 decreased the clonogenic growth of leukemic progenitors and induced apoptosis of blast cells, with limited toxicity against normal hematopoiesis, which emphasize the importance of translation deregulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) biology. However, the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (a rapamycin derivate) did not induce AML blast cell apoptosis. We herein demonstrated that mTORC1 disruption using raptor siRNA or RAD001 failed to inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in AML. Moreover, RAD001 failed to inhibit eIF4F assembly, to decrease the proportion of polysome-bound c-Myc mRNA, and to reduce the translation-dependent accumulation of oncogenic proteins. We identified the Pim-2 serine/threonine kinase as mainly responsible for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation on the S(65) residue and subsequent translation control in AML.

A pharmacologic inhibitor, BI2536, blocks proliferation in established cell lines, and dramatically inhibits the clonogenic potential of leukemic cells from patients. Plk1 knockdown by small interfering RNA also blocked proliferation of leukemic cell lines and the clonogenic potential of primary cells from patients. Interestingly, normal primary hematopoietic progenitors are less sensitive to Plk1 inhibition than leukemic cells, whose proliferation is dramatically decreased by the inhibitor.

Streptococcus mitis group species (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis) are among the VGS most often encountered in clinical practice. Identifying the portal of entry for S. mitis group strains is crucial for interventions preventing bacterial translocation. Unfortunately, tracking the source of S. mitis group strains is dependent on a combination of extremely laborious and time-consuming cultivation and molecular techniques (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR [ERIC-PCR]). To simplify this procedure, a PCR analysis with newly designed primers targeting the household gene glucose kinase (gki) was used in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). This gki-PCR-DGGE technique proved to be specific for S. mitis group strains. Moreover, these strains could be detected in samples comprised of highly diverse microbiota, without prior cultivation. To study the feasibility of this new approach, a pilot study was performed. This confirmed that the source of S. mitis group bacteremia in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia could be tracked back to the throat in five out of six episodes of bacteremia, despite the fact that throat samples are polymicrobial samples containing multiple S. mitis group strains. In contrast, using the classical combination of cultivation techniques and ERIC-PCR, we could detect these strains in only two out of six cases, showing the superiority of the newly developed technique. The new gki-PCR-DGGE technique can track the source of S. mitis group strains in polymicrobial samples without prior cultivation. Therefore, it is a valuable tool in future epidemiological studies.","['van Vliet, M J', 'Tissing, W J E', 'de Bont, E S J M', 'Meessen, N E L', 'Kamps, W A', 'Harmsen, H J M']","['van Vliet MJ', 'Tissing WJ', 'de Bont ES', 'Meessen NE', 'Kamps WA', 'Harmsen HJ']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090520,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Bacterial/*genetics', 'Electrophoresis/*methods', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology/methods', '*Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology', 'Streptococcus mitis/*classification/*isolation & purification']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']","['JCM.00089-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.00089-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2009 Jul;47(7):2181-6. doi: 10.1128/JCM.00089-09.

Hence, sustained remission requires a long phase of therapy. Data indicate that a combination of different available targeted drugs might prevent treatment failure due to drug resistance, especially at advanced stages of the disease. However, for long-term multiple-drug treatments, complications can arise from side effects. We investigate whether and how the number of drugs could be reduced during long-term therapy. Using computational models, we show that one or more drugs can be removed once the number of tumor cells is reduced significantly, without compromising the chances of sustained tumor suppression. Which drug to remove first depends on the number of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene that confer resistance to the drugs, as well as on how effectively the drugs inhibit Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase activity and inhibit tumor growth. We further show that the number of CML cells at which the number of drugs can be reduced does not correlate with the two phases of decline of the BCR-ABL transcript numbers. Neither does it depend much on kinetic parameters of CML growth, except for the mutation rates at which resistance is generated. This is a significant finding because even without any information on most parameters, and using only the data on the number of cancer cells and the rate at which resistant mutants are generated, it is possible to predict at which stage of treatment the number of drugs can be reduced.","['Komarova, Natalia L', 'Wodarz, Dominik']","['Komarova NL', 'Wodarz D']","['Departments of Mathematics and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],['1R01CA129286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090519,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Genes, abl/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/physiology']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-1959 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1959 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;69(11):4904-10. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1959.

Rel/NF-kappaB transcriptional and oncogenic activities are modulated by several posttranslational modifications and coregulatory proteins, and previous studies showed that cytokine treatment induces binding of Pin1 to the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB, thereby enhancing RelA nuclear localization and stability. Here we show that Pin1 associates with the Rel subunits of NF-kappaB that are implicated in leukemia/lymphomagenesis and modulates their transcriptional and oncogenic activities. Pin1 markedly enhanced transformation of primary lymphocytes by the human c-Rel protein and also increased cell transformation by the potent viral Rel/NF-kappaB oncoprotein v-Rel, in contrast to a Pin1 mutant in the WW domain involved in interaction with NF-kappaB. Pin1 promoted nuclear accumulation of Rel proteins in the absence of activating stimuli. Importantly, inhibition of Pin1 function with the pharmacologic inhibitor juglone or with Pin1-specific shRNA led to cytoplasmic relocalization of endogenous c-Rel in human lymphoma-derived cell lines, markedly interfered with lymphoma cell proliferation, and suppressed endogenous Rel/NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. Together, these results show that Pin1 is an important regulator of Rel/NF-kappaB transforming activity and suggest that Pin1 may be a potential therapeutic target in Rel/NF-kappaB-dependent leukemia/lymphomas.","['Fan, Gaofeng', 'Fan, Yongjun', 'Gupta, Nupur', 'Matsuura, Isao', 'Liu, Fang', 'Zhou, Xiao Zhen', 'Lu, Kun Ping', 'Gelinas, Celine']","['Fan G', 'Fan Y', 'Gupta N', 'Matsuura I', 'Liu F', 'Zhou XZ', 'Lu KP', 'Gelinas C']","['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School 679 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA054999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054999-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA054999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090519,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'W6Q80SK9L6 (juglone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/physiology', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Naphthoquinones/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4117 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4117 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;69(11):4589-97. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4117.

Recent reports suggest that the multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) gene is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. To investigate whether additional drug transporters are regulated by HDACi and how this affects cytotoxicity, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were examined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AML cells were cultured in the presence of phenylbutyrate, valproate, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, or trichostatin A and analyzed for drug transporter expression and function as well as sensitivity to anticancer drugs. RESULTS: MDR1, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) 7 and 8 were induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner as shown by semiquantitative PCR. The pattern of gene induction was cell line specific. Phenylbutyrate induced P-glycoprotein and BCRP expression and the efflux of drugs as determined with labeled substrates. KG-1a cells treated with phenylbutyrate developed resistance to daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, vinblastine, paclitaxel, topotecan, gemcitabine, and 5-fluorouracil; as a result drug-induced apoptosis was impaired. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the hyperacetylation of histone proteins in the promoter regions of MDR1, BCRP, and MRP8 on valproate treatment. Furthermore, an alternative MRP8 promoter was induced by HDACi treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of AML cells to HDACi induces a drug resistance phenotype broader than the ""classic multidrug resistance,"" which might negatively affect treatment effectiveness.","['Hauswald, Stefanie', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Wagner, Michaela M', 'Schertl, Florian M', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Keller, Ulrich', 'Licht, Thomas']","['Hauswald S', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Wagner MM', 'Schertl FM', 'Lubbert M', 'Peschel C', 'Keller U', 'Licht T']","['III.

Because clinical outcomes vary markedly within cytogenetic subgroups, additional biological markers are needed for risk stratification.

RESULTS: All three enzymatic activities were significantly (P < 0.001) increased in the plasma of patients with AML and MDS compared with normal controls. Both chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, but not trypsin-like activity, correlated with outcome. Chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, but not trypsin-like activity, predicted response in univariate analysis (P = 0.002).

Similarly, both chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, but not trypsin-like activity, were predictors of overall survival in univariate analysis (P < 0.0001), but only chymotrypsin-like activity was independent of cytogenetics, age, performance status, blood urea nitrogen, and beta(2)-microglobulin in multivariate Cox regression models. Chymotrypsin-like activity was also a strong independent predictor of survival in patients with intermediate karyotype (n = 124). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring plasma chymotrypsin-like activity may provide a powerful biomarker for risk stratification in patients with AML and advanced-stage MDS, including those with normal karyotype.","['Ma, Wanlong', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Bekele, Benjamin', 'Donahue, Amber C', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Zhang, Zhong J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Estey, Elihu', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Keating, Michael', 'Giles, Francis', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Ma W', 'Kantarjian H', 'Bekele B', 'Donahue AC', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang ZJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Estey E', 'Estrov Z', 'Cortes J', 'Keating M', 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, California, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20090519,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Caspases/blood/metabolism', 'Chymotrypsin/blood/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*blood/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trypsin/blood/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-3034 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3034 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;15(11):3820-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-3034.

Concentration dependency for the increase in the DNA melting temperature was used to determine the DNA binding strength and whether bisintercalation occurred for the newly synthesized analogs. The ability of the compounds to inhibit the growth of the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line and inhibit the decatenation activity of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha was also measured. Finally, the compounds were evaluated for their ability to act as topoisomerase II poisons by measuring the topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated double strand cleavage of DNA. All of the bisanthrapyrazoles inhibited K562 cell growth and topoisomerase IIalpha in the low micromolar range. Compounds with either two or three methylene linkers formed bisintercalation complexes with DNA and bound as strongly as, or more strongly than, doxorubicin.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of ATO action on APL-derived NB4 cells and gastric cancer cell lines. ATO decreased the viability of both cell lines, but gastric cancer cells were much less susceptible. ATO-induced G2/M phase arrest and p53 degradation in gastric cancer MGC803 cells. In contrast, ATO-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells without degradation of p53. Both processes were accompanied by transient activation of Akt. The PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 significantly increased the amount of p53 protein and ATO-induced apoptosis in both cell lines and decreased G2/M phase arrest of MGC803 cells. In addition, ATO up-regulated the expression of Cbl proteins in both cell lines. Inhibition of Cbl with the proteasome inhibitor Ps341 decreased apoptosis in NB4 cells and increased the G2/M phase arrest of MGC803 cells, and it also prolonged the activation of PI3K/Akt by ATO. Consistent results with those in MGC803 cells were showed in gastric cancer cell BGC823 and SGC7901 after ATO treatment. These results demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling by Cbl is involved in both ATO-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells and ATO-induced G2/M phase arrest of gastric cancer cells. Cbl achieved these effects probably via its regulating PI3K/Akt pathway, and thereby modulated p53 activation.","['Li, Yingchun', 'Qu, Xiujuan', 'Qu, Jinglei', 'Zhang, Ye', 'Liu, Jing', 'Teng, Yuee', 'Hu, Xuejun', 'Hou, Kezuo', 'Liu, Yunpeng']","['Li Y', 'Qu X', 'Qu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu J', 'Teng Y', 'Hu X', 'Hou K', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology, The First Hospital, China Medical University, Heping District, Shenyang City 110001, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090519,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Metaphase/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*drug effects/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/10/21 06:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00296-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.04.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2009 Nov 1;284(2):208-15. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.04.035.

As HSC survival is central to the progression of liver fibrosis, our goal was to investigate if phagocytosis induces HSC survival. METHODS: Apoptosis of phagocytosing HSC was studied in the presence of known apoptotic agents. The JAK/STAT- and PI3K/Akt-dependent pathways, NF-kappaB activation and expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and A1 were evaluated. Apoptosis was assessed after blocking A1 by an siRNA approach. RESULTS: Phagocytosing HSC were resistant to FasL/cycloheximide or TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT or PI3K-mediated pathways induced apoptosis of HSC. Phagocytosis induced JAK1/STAT3 phosphorylation, and this was prevented by inhibiting JAK. Translocation of STAT3 to the nucleus was also blocked by JAK inhibition. Mcl-1 expression was upregulated in a JAK-dependent manner. PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt depended on NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide production. NF-kappaB activation and subsequent upregulation of A1 was observed, and A1 inhibition induced apoptosis of HSC. CONCLUSION: Phagocytosis of AB promotes HSC survival by two pathways, of which the A1 dependent is more significant. This represents a new mechanism by which engulfment of AB contributes to the propagation of liver fibrosis.","['Jiang, Joy X', 'Mikami, Kenichiro', 'Venugopal, Senthil', 'Li, Yong', 'Torok, Natalie J']","['Jiang JX', 'Mikami K', 'Venugopal S', 'Li Y', 'Torok NJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, UC Davis Medical Center, Patient Support Services Building, 4150 V Street, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.']",['eng'],"['DK069765/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK069765-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK083283/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK069765/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DK080715/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DK080715-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090503,Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/*physiology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0168-8278(09)00248-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2009.03.024 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2009 Jul;51(1):139-48. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2009.03.024.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: For cases occurring during 1990-2005 the following data about workers were checked: birth date, sex, location of the neoplasm, date of diagnosis of the neoplasm, working category, hospital service/unit and work duration at the hospital. The standard incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for each type of cancer. RESULTS: Fifty one neoplasms were registered (21 male and 30 women) Most frequent types of cancer were breast (19 cases), leukemia-lymphoma (7 cases), lung (4 cases) and prostate (4 cases). At the time of diagnosis the average age was 47,3 years (DE 9,2). 22 cases were detected in doctors, 18 in nurses and assistant nurses and 4 in assistants. An excess of cases was not found. Comparing data with cancer cases in the whole population, the prevalence of colon cancer was lower than the average (SIR: 0,25; CI 95%: 0,03-0,89) as well as the prevalence of gastric cancer (SIR: 0,19; CI 95%: 0,02-0,69). CONCLUSIONS: An excess of cancer risk was not found in the studied group.

METHODS: We determined STLV-1 virus tropism in vivo and its relation to the immune response by evaluating cytokine production and T-cell subsets in naturally infected and uninfected mandrills. RESULTS: With real-time PCR methods, we found that STLV-1 in mandrills infects both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells; however, proviral loads were significantly higher (P = 0.01) in CD4(+) than in CD8(+) cells (mean STLV-1 copies number per 100 cells (+/- SD) was 7.8 +/- 8 in CD4(+) T cells and 3.9 +/- 4.5 in CD8(+) T cells). After culture, STLV-1 provirus was detected in enriched CD4(+) but not in enriched CD8(+) T cells. After 6 months of culture, STLV-1-transformed cell lines expressing CD3(+), CD4(+) and HLADR(+) were established, and STLV-1 proteins and tax/rex mRNA were detected. In STLV-1 infected monkeys, there was a correlation between high proviral load and elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The two monkeys with the highest STLV-1 proviral load had activated CD4(+)HLADR(+) and CD8(+)HLADR(+) T-cell subsets and a high percentage of CD25(+) in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first cellular, immunological and virological characterization of natural STLV-1 infection in mandrills and shows that they are an appropriate animal model for further physiopathological studies of the natural history of human T-cell leukaemia viruses.","['Souquiere, Sandrine', 'Mouinga-Ondeme, Augustin', 'Makuwa, Maria', 'Beggio, Paola', 'Radaelli, Antonia', 'De Giuli Morghen, Carlo', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Kazanji, Mirdad']","['Souquiere S', 'Mouinga-Ondeme A', 'Makuwa M', 'Beggio P', 'Radaelli A', 'De Giuli Morghen C', 'Mortreux F', 'Kazanji M']","['Departement de Retrovirologie, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Franceville, Gabon.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090423,Denmark,J Med Primatol,Journal of medical primatology,0320626,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', '*Mandrillus', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Viral Load']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JMP356 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0684.2009.00356.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Primatol. 2009 Aug;38(4):279-89. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0684.2009.00356.x.

Here we investigated potential neuroprotective action of tamibarotene (Am80), an RARalpha/beta agonist available for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, on midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Am80 protected dopaminergic neurons in rat midbrain slice culture from injury mediated by lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia, without affecting production of nitric oxide, a key mediator of cell injury. The effect of Am80 was mimicked by another RAR agonist, TAC-101, but not by a retinoid X receptor agonist, HX630, and HX630 did not synergize with Am80. We observed neuronal expression of RARalpha and RARbeta in midbrain slice culture and also found that Am80 increased tissue level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA. Exogenous BDNF prevented dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and the neuroprotective effect of Am80 was suppressed by a TrkB inhibitor, K252a, or by anti-BDNF neutralizing antibody. These results reveal a novel action of RARs mediated by enhancement of BDNF expression. Finally, oral administration of Am80 prevented dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra induced by local injection of lipopolysaccharide in mice, indicating that RARs are a promising target of therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.","['Katsuki, Hiroshi', 'Kurimoto, Emi', 'Takemori, Sachiko', 'Kurauchi, Yuki', 'Hisatsune, Akinori', 'Isohama, Yoichiro', 'Izumi, Yasuhiko', 'Kume, Toshiaki', 'Shudo, Koichi', 'Akaike, Akinori']","['Katsuki H', 'Kurimoto E', 'Takemori S', 'Kurauchi Y', 'Hisatsune A', 'Isohama Y', 'Izumi Y', 'Kume T', 'Shudo K', 'Akaike A']","['Department of Chemico-Pharmacological Sciences, Kumamoto University, Japan. hkatsuki@gpo.kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090515,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoates/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*physiology', 'Dopamine/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mesencephalon/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Degeneration/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists/*metabolism/physiology', 'Retinoids/agonists/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']","['JNC6171 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06171.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2009 Jul;110(2):707-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06171.x.

However, the primary complication limiting the safety of transplantation is graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which is mediated by donor T cells. Strategies for pre- and post-transplant manipulation of graft cells are not yet optimal for balancing GvHD severity with beneficial Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL) effects. Emerging cell fate control gene therapy (CFCGT)-based strategies, such as 'suicide' gene therapy for donor T cell regulation, can supplement existing transplantation approaches by providing a safety element to reduce GvHD. Past uses of CFCGT in the clinic have provided proof-of-principle that GvHD can be controlled by such a strategy. However, there exists a need for improved transgene delivery and suicide control systems. Recently, lentiviral vectors (LVs) have emerged as effective gene delivery vehicles for the clinic. Combining lentiviral gene delivery with newer generations of 'suicide' systems that possess improved enzyme/prodrug specificities, activities, and reduced immunogenicity, could provide the necessary degree of control required to more successfully manage GvHD. Improving the safety of transplantation through successful CFCGT will serve to expand the potential donor pool and the spectrum of disorders that can be treated by this therapeutic schema.","['Scaife, Matthew D', 'Neschadim, Anton', 'Fowler, D H', 'Medin, J A']","['Scaife MD', 'Neschadim A', 'Fowler DH', 'Medin JA']","['University of Toronto, Department of Medical Biophysics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/05/22 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/05/22 09:00'],"['2009/05/22 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712590903002021 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2009 Jun;9(6):749-61. doi: 10.1517/14712590903002021.,10.1517/14712590903002021 [doi],,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only in rare instances, the reports take into account mechanistic characteristics of the translocation mechanism. To assess the functional ability of several sites implicated in supposedly V(D)J-mediated translocations, we tested five sites at four proto-oncogene loci in an ex vivo recombination substrate assay for their potential to act as direct target for V(D)J recombination. Our results show that the LMO2/RBTN2/TTG2 site and one LCK/P56 site readily engage in recombination with a genuine TCR element with the majority of breakpoint junctions showing the characteristics of V(D)J recombination, which strongly supports the involvement of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of the corresponding translocations in vivo.

Results from 55 Asian and 615 non-Asian patients demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of dasatinib was comparable. Dasatinib was well tolerated, with no observed toxicities exclusive to Asian patients. A higher incidence of adverse events and lower rate of response observed among Asian patients with myeloid blast phase CML reflected the aggressive nature of the disease. Analyses of noncompartmental pharmacokinetics (5 Asian and 49 non-Asian patients) and population pharmacokinetics (17 Asian and 382 non-Asian patients) were also comparable.

These are used to calculate equivalent and effective dose coefficients (dose in Sv Bq(-1) intake), considering occupational and environmental exposures. Dose coefficients have also been given for a range of radiopharmaceuticals used in diagnostic medicine. Using equivalent and effective dose, exposures from external sources and from different radionuclides can be summed for comparison with dose limits, constraints and reference levels that relate to risks from whole-body radiation exposure. Risk estimates are derived largely from follow-up studies of the survivors of the atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. New dose coefficients will be required following the publication in 2007 of new ICRP recommendations. ICRP biokinetic and dosimetric models are subject to continuing review and improvement, although it is arguable that the degree of sophistication of some of the most recent models is greater than required for the calculation of effective dose to a reference person for the purposes of regulatory control. However, the models are also used in the calculation of best estimates of doses and risks to individuals, in epidemiological studies and to determine probability of cancer causation. Models are then adjusted to best fit the characteristics of the individuals and population under consideration. For example, doses resulting from massive discharges of strontium-90 and other radionuclides to the Techa River from the Russian Mayak plutonium plant in the early years of its operation are being estimated using models adapted to take account of measurements on local residents and other population-specific data. Best estimates of doses to haemopoietic bone marrow, in utero and postnatally, are being used in epidemiological studies of radiation-induced leukaemia. Radon-222 is the one internal emitter for which control of exposure is based on direct information on cancer risks, with extensive information available on lung cancer induction by radon progeny in mines and consistent data on risks in homes. The dose per unit (222)Rn exposure can be calculated by comparing lung cancer risk estimates derived for (222)Rn exposure and for external exposure of the Japanese survivors. Remarkably similar values are obtained by this method and by calculations using the ICRP model of the respiratory tract, providing good support for model assumptions. Other informative comparisons with risks from external exposure can be made for Thorotrast-induced liver cancer and leukaemia, and radium-induced bone cancer. The bone-seeking alpha emitters, plutonium-239 and radium isotopes, are poorer leukaemogens than predicted by models. ICRP dose coefficients are published as single values without consideration of uncertainties. However, it is clear that full consideration of uncertainties is appropriate when considering best estimates of doses and risks to individuals or specific population groups. An understanding of the component uncertainties in the calculation of dose coefficients can be seen as an important goal and should help inform judgements on the control of exposures. The routine consideration of uncertainties in dose assessments, if achievable, would be of questionable value when doses are generally maintained at small fractions of limits.","['Harrison, John']",['Harrison J'],"['Health Protection Agency, Radiation Protection Division, CRCE, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon, OX11 0RQ, UK. john.harrison@hpa.org.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090519,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', 'DQY03U61EJ (Polonium)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Models, Biological', 'Plutonium/adverse effects', 'Polonium/adverse effects', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Radon/adverse effects', '*Risk Assessment']",2009/05/21 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['S0952-4746(09)07626-5 [pii]', '10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2009 Jun;29(2A):A81-A105. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S06.

Moreover, workplace exposure to radiation usually involves irradiation conditions that are of direct relevance to the principal concern of radiological protection: protracted exposure to low level radiation. Further, some workers have been exposed to radioactive material that has been inadvertently taken into the body, and the study of these groups leads to risk estimates derived directly from the experience of those irradiated by these 'internal emitters', intakes of alpha-particle-emitters being of particular interest. Workforces that have been the subject of epidemiological study include medical staff, aircrews, radium dial luminisers, underground hard-rock miners, Chernobyl clean-up workers, nuclear weapons test participants and nuclear industry workers. The first solid epidemiological evidence of the stochastic effects of irradiation came from a study of occupational exposure to medical x-rays that was reported in 1944, which demonstrated a large excess risk of leukaemia among US radiologists; but the general lack of dose records for early medical staff who tended to experience the highest exposures hampers the derivation of risks per unit dose received by medical workers. The instrument dial luminisers who inadvertently ingested large amounts of radium-based paint and underground hard-rock miners who inhaled large quantities of radon and its decay products suffered markedly raised excess risks of, respectively, bone and lung cancers; the miner studies have provided standard risk estimates for radon-induced lung cancer. The large numbers of nuclear industry workers around the world present a possibility of deriving risk coefficients of direct relevance to radiological protection, and the recently published study of workers from 15 countries illustrates what can be achieved by international collaboration. However, it would appear that there are some problems with this study that require attention before reliance can be placed upon the results. Early workers from the Mayak plutonium production facility in Russia were heavily exposed to external sources of penetrating radiation and to plutonium, and appreciable effort has been expended in obtaining dependable risk estimates from this scientifically valuable group of workers. Those occupationally exposed to low levels of radiation also present an opportunity of studying possible somatic health effects other than cancer, such as heart disease and eye cataracts, that are the subject of much discussion at present. Overall, studies of exposure to ionising radiation in the workplace provide a valuable support to studies of those groups exposed under other circumstances, and in some instances (such as exposure to plutonium) effectively offer the only direct source of epidemiological evidence on risks.","['Wakeford, Richard']",['Wakeford R'],"['Dalton Nuclear Institute, The University of Manchester, Pariser Building-G Floor, PO Box 88, Sackville Street, Manchester M60 1QD, UK.

Leukaemia was the first cancer to be associated with atomic bomb radiation exposure, with preliminary indications of an excess among the survivors within the first five years after the bombings. An excess of solid cancers became apparent approximately ten years after radiation exposure. With increasing follow-up, excess risks of most cancer types have been observed, the major exceptions being chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancer. For most solid cancer sites a linear dose response is observed, although in the latest follow-up of the mortality data there is evidence (p = 0.10) for an upward curvature in the dose response for all solid cancers. The only cancer sites which exhibit (upward) curvature in the dose response are leukaemia, and non-melanoma skin and bone cancer. For leukaemia the dose response is very markedly upward curving, indeed largely describable as a pure quadratic dose response, particularly in the low dose (0-2 Sv) range. Even 55 years after the bombings over 40% of the Life Span Study cohort remain alive, so continued follow-up of this group is vital for completing our understanding of long-term radiation effects in people. In general, the relative risks per unit dose among the Japanese atomic bomb survivors are greater than those among comparable subsets in studies of medically exposed individuals. Cell sterilisation largely accounts for the discrepancy in relative risks between these two populations, although other factors may contribute, such as the generally higher underlying cancer risks in the medical series than in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Risks among occupationally exposed groups such as nuclear workforces and underground miners are generally consistent with those observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. In general, consistent patterns of variation of risk with age at exposure are also seen in all studies-risks for all cancer types diminish with increasing age at exposure. There are also excess risks of various types of non-malignant disease in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, in particular cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive diseases. Indeed, risks are elevated to much the same degree for a number of non-malignant disease endpoints, suggestive of bias. However, in contrast with the cancer data, there is much less consistency in the pattern of risk between the atomic bomb survivors and other exposed groups; for example, radiation-associated respiratory and digestive diseases have not been seen in these other groups. Although cardiovascular risks have been seen elsewhere, particularly in medically exposed groups, in contrast with the cancer data there is much less consistency in risk between studies: risks per unit dose in epidemiological studies vary over at least two orders of magnitude, possibly as a result of confounding factors. In the absence of a convincing mechanistic explanation of epidemiological evidence, at present a cause-and-effect interpretation of the reported statistical associations for cardiovascular disease is unreliable but cannot be excluded. Further epidemiological and biological evidence will allow a firmer conclusion to be drawn.","['Little, M P']",['Little MP'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College, London W2 1PG, UK. mark.little@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090519,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Survivors', 'Time Factors']",2009/05/21 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['S0952-4746(09)93862-9 [pii]', '10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S04 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2009 Jun;29(2A):A43-59. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S04.

This paper examines doses from natural radiation to the red bone marrow, the tissue in which leukaemia is considered to originate, with particular emphasis on doses to children. The most significant contributions are from x-rays and gamma rays, radionuclides in food and inhalation of isotopes of radon and their decay products. External radiation sources and radionuclides other than radon dominate marrow doses at all ages. The variation with age of the various components of marrow dose is considered, including doses received in utero and in each year up to the age of 15. Doses in utero include contributions resulting from the ingestion of radionuclides by the mother and placental transfer to the foetus. Postnatal doses include those from radionuclides in breast-milk and from radionuclides ingested in other foods. Doses are somewhat higher in the first year of life and there is a general slow decline from the second year of life onwards. The low linear energy transfer (LET) component of absorbed dose to the red bone marrow is much larger than the high LET component. However, because of the higher radiation weighting factor for the latter it contributes about 40% of the equivalent dose incurred up to the age of 15.","['Kendall, G M', 'Fell, T P', 'Harrison, J D']","['Kendall GM', 'Fell TP', 'Harrison JD']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HJ, UK.

It also represents one of the first allergen sources, which induces IgE-mediated allergies in childhood ranging from gastrointestinal, skin, and respiratory manifestations to severe life-threatening manifestations, such as anaphylaxis. Here we isolated a cDNA coding for a major cow's milk allergen, alphaS1-casein, from a bovine mammary gland cDNA library with allergic patients' IgE Abs. Recombinant alphaS1-casein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized by circular dichroism as a folded protein. IgE epitopes of alphaS1-casein were determined with recombinant fragments and synthetic peptides spanning the alphaS1-casein sequence using microarrayed components and sera from 66 cow's milk-sensitized patients. The allergenic activity of ralphaS1-casein and the alphaS1-casein-derived peptides was determined using rat basophil leukemia cells transfected with human FcepsilonRI, which had been loaded with the patients' serum IgE. Our results demonstrate that ralphaS1-casein as well as alphaS1-casein-derived peptides exhibit IgE reactivity, but mainly the intact ralphaS1-casein induced strong basophil degranulation. These results suggest that primarily intact alphaS1-casein or larger IgE-reactive portions thereof are responsible for IgE-mediated symptoms of food allergy.

It displays features of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage. There is still a lack of studies in biphenotypic acute leukemia in a Chinese population. We present here a comprehensive investigation of the clinical and biological characteristics, and outcome of biphenotypic acute leukemia in our hospital in over a seven year period. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 452 adult acute leukemia patients diagnosed according to French-American-British (FAB) classification and biphenotypic acute leukemia diagnosed according to European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL) classification, respectively. Biological characteristics, response to treatment, and outcome were examined in biphenotypic acute leukemia patients and compared with that in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with complete follow-up profiles diagnosed in the same period. RESULTS: Of 452 acute leukemia patients, 21 cases (4.6%) were diagnosed as biphenotypic acute leukemia. Among them, 14 (66.7%) were B lymphoid and myeloid, 5 (23.8%) were T lymphoid and myeloid, one (4.8%) was T/B lymphoid and one (4.8%) was trilineage differentiation. When compared with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia showed significantly higher incidence of CD34 antigen expression, unfavorable karyotypes, and extramedullary infiltration (p<0.05). In this cohort of patients with biphenotypic acute leukemia, t(9;22) was the most common abnormality in chromosome structure. The median disease-free survival and overall survival in biphenotypic acute leukemia patients was five months and ten months, respectively, significantly shorter than those in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of biphenotypic acute leukemia patients is poor when compared with de novo acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Biphenotypic acute leukemia patients showed a much higher incidence of CD34 antigen expression, complex abnormal karyotype, extramedullary infiltration, relapse, and resistance to therapy after relapse.","['Xu, Xiao-Qian', 'Wang, Jian-Min', 'Lu, Shu-Qing', 'Chen, Li', 'Yang, Jian-Min', 'Zhang, Wei-Ping', 'Song, Xian-Min', 'Hou, Jun', 'Ni, Xiong', 'Qiu, Hui-Ying']","['Xu XQ', 'Wang JM', 'Lu SQ', 'Chen L', 'Yang JM', 'Zhang WP', 'Song XM', 'Hou J', 'Ni X', 'Qiu HY']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Secondary Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090519,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/ethnology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/ethnology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/05/21 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.003202 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.003202 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Jul;94(7):919-27. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.003202.

Early B-cell precursors were negative while intermediate precursors and mature B cells showed weak CD123 expression. Leukemic blasts in 31% of precursor-B ALL samples exhibited strong expression of CD123, 61% had moderate CD123 expression and 8% were negative; 81.5% of ALL with hyperdiploid karyotype (>/= 52 chromosomes) showed strong CD123 overexpression. In contrast, cases with ETV6/RUNX1 rearrangement had weak CD123 expression. Our study suggests that overexpression of CD123 is an aberrant phenotype present in a subset of precursor-B ALL with hyperdiploid genotype, and represents an additional marker of good prognosis in pediatric precursor-B ALL.

Gene transfer and expression for cytokine and immunomodulatory molecules in various kinds of tumor cells have been shown to mediate tumor regression and antimetastatic effects. Moreover, genetically modified leukemia cells expressing costimulatory molecules or cytokines are likely to have significant therapeutic roles for patients with leukemia. One of the major hurdles to the successful implementation of these promising approaches is the lack of a suitable nanocarrier for transgene delivery and expression in a safe and effective manner. Recently, we reported on the development of a safe, efficient nanocarrier system of carbonate apatite that can assist both intracellular delivery and release of DNA, leading to very high level of transgene expression in cancer and primary cells. However, its efficiency in human lymphocytes is poor. We show here that nanocrystals of carbonate apatite, when electrostatically associated with fibronectin and/or E-cadherin-Fc, accelerated transgene delivery in a human T leukemia cell line (Jurkat). Moreover, transgene expression efficiency could be enhanced dramatically with the cell adhesive protein-embedded particles finally up to 150 times by selectively disrupting the actin filaments.","['Kutsuzawa, K', 'Tada, S', 'Hossain, S', 'Fukuda, K', 'Maruyama, K', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Akaike, T', 'Chowdhury, E H']","['Kutsuzawa K', 'Tada S', 'Hossain S', 'Fukuda K', 'Maruyama K', 'Akiyama Y', 'Akaike T', 'Chowdhury EH']","['Graduate School of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",20090210,United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Apatites)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '55326-60-8 (carboapatite)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*drug effects', 'Apatites/*chemistry', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Plasmids', 'Transfection/*methods']",2009/05/21 09:00,2010/06/17 06:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2008/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0003-2697(09)00101-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2009.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2009 May 1;388(1):164-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2009.02.006.

Here we employed Western blotting and ELISA assay to investigate the response of post-translationally modified p53 (particularly phosphorylated on serine 15) after gamma-irradiation. We have found the amount of phosphorylated p53 to be homogenously increased after irradiation by the doses of 0.5 to 7.5 Gy.

HTLV-I is endemic in southern Japan, the Caribbean, Central and South America, certain areas of Africa, and the southeastern United States. In the Middle East, North East Iran, particularly the region of Mashhad, has been recognized as an endemic region. CASE REPORTS: In this report, the first two cases of ATL diagnosed in Lebanon are described. The first patient of Lebanese origin presented with acute ATL. The second patient of Romanian origin developed acute ATL in early relapse after autologous transplantation for ATL. Both patients had lymphocytosis, severe hypercalcemia, and CD25+ T-cell immunophenotype on peripheral blood. In both patients, HTLV-I serology was positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot and HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax expression was documented in the leukemic cells. Upon screening, seven direct family members of the first patient were HTLV-I positive; four of them were regular blood donors. CONCLUSIONS: Screening blood donors for HTLV-I seropositivity is not currently performed in Lebanon. A large screening study in Lebanon is needed to confirm whether South Lebanon is a new endemic region for HTLV-I infection and to recommend mandatory screening of blood donors for HTLV-I infection.","['Bitar, Nizar', 'Hajj, Hiba El', 'Houmani, Zaher', 'Sabbah, Ahmad', 'Otrock, Zaher K', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Zaatari, Ghazi', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Bitar N', 'Hajj HE', 'Houmani Z', 'Sabbah A', 'Otrock ZK', 'Mahfouz R', 'Zaatari G', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Hematology Oncology, Transfusion Medicine, Sahel Hospital, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon. nbitar@inco.com.lb']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090518,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diphosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/blood', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Lebanon', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use', 'Zoledronic Acid']",2009/05/21 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['TRF02223 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02223.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2009 Sep;49(9):1859-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02223.x.

The suppressor of cytokine signaling protein SOCS3 drives lysosomal degradation of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), depending on SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination of a specific lysine located in a conserved juxtamembrane motif. Here, we show that, despite ubiquitination of other lysines, positioning of a lysine within the membrane-proximal region is indispensable for this process. Neither reallocation of the motif nor fusion of ubiquitin to the C-terminus of the G-CSFR could drive lysosomal routing. However, within this region, the lysine could be shifted 12 amino acids toward the C-terminus without losing its function, arguing against the existence of a linear sorting motif and demonstrating that positioning of the lysine relative to the SOCS3 docking site is flexible. G-CSFR ubiquitination peaked after endocytosis, was inhibited by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin as well as hyperosmotic sucrose and severely reduced in internalization-defective G-CSFR mutants, indicating that ubiquitination mainly occurs at endosomes. Apart from elucidating structural and spatio-temporal aspects of SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination, these findings have implications for the abnormal signaling function of G-CSFR mutants found in severe congenital neutropenia, a hematopoietic disorder with a high leukemia risk.","['Wolfler, Albert', 'Irandoust, Mahban', 'Meenhuis, Annemarie', 'Gits, Judith', 'Roovers, Onno', 'Touw, Ivo P']","['Wolfler A', 'Irandoust M', 'Meenhuis A', 'Gits J', 'Roovers O', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090512,England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Endocytosis/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Transport/*physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2009/05/21 09:00,2009/10/06 06:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['TRA928 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00928.x [doi]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2009 Aug;10(8):1168-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00928.x.

We have investigated the gene expression profile associated with trisomy 12 (+12). DESIGN: Initially, unselected peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four patients with +12 were compared with 16 CLL controls using microarray analysis. RESULTS: were validated by quantitative real-time PCR with RNA from 61 patients (29 with +12, 32 CLL controls). Results Seven genes showing the strongest correlation with +12 in microarray analysis were selected for real-time PCR: HIP1R, MYF6, SLC2A6, CD9 (overexpressed); CD200, P2RY14, RASGRP3 (underexpressed). Four genes were significantly associated with +12: HIP1R (P<0.0001), MYF6 (P=0.007), P2RY14 (P=0.014), CD200 (P=0.028). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis revealed that HIP1R expression was a highly sensitive and specific marker for +12 in CLL patients. MYF6 was exclusively expressed in normal or malignant B cells in peripheral blood but was poorly predictive for +12. As expected, a number of overexpressed genes are located on chromosome 12 (HIP1R, MYF6). Interestingly, both significantly underexpressed genes (P2RY14, CD200) reside on the long arm of chromosome 3 pointing to trans-repression in this region. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the molecular signature of trisomy 12 in CLL resulted in: (i) identification of a surrogate marker for PCR (HIP1R); (ii) observation of a gene dosage effect; and (iii) detection of specific underexpression of genes located on chromosome 3. These results should help to improve diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with CLL and trisomy 12.","['Porpaczy, E', 'Bilban, M', 'Heinze, G', 'Gruber, M', 'Vanura, K', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Streubel, B', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Jaeger, U']","['Porpaczy E', 'Bilban M', 'Heinze G', 'Gruber M', 'Vanura K', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Streubel B', 'Fonatsch C', 'Jaeger U']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090430,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Trisomy/genetics/*pathology']",2009/05/21 09:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2146 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02146.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2009 Jul;39(7):568-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02146.x.

However, platforms for their large-scale production must be further developed. As a proof of principle, we reported the generation of a packaging cell line that produces amphotropic retroviral vectors in suspension and serum-free medium (SFM). In the present study, we have constructed and characterized two retroviral packaging cell lines designed for gene transfer in hematopoietic cells. These cell lines grow in suspension and SFM, and produce high-titer RD114- and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped vectors for a 3-month culture period. Viral particles released are as robust during repeated freeze-thaw cycles and on thermal inactivation at 37 degrees C as their counterparts produced in cells cultured adherently with serum. We also show that RD114- and GALV-pseudotyped vectors produced in suspension and SFM efficiently transduce human lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. As these retroviral packaging cell lines distinctively maintain high vector titers while growing in suspension and SFM, we conclude that these cell lines are uniquely suitable for large-scale clinical-grade vector production for late-phase clinical trials involving gene transfer into hematopoietic cells.","['Ghani, Karim', 'Wang, Xiuyan', 'de Campos-Lima, Pedro Otavio', 'Olszewska, Malgorzata', 'Kamen, Amine', 'Riviere, Isabelle', 'Caruso, Manuel']","['Ghani K', 'Wang X', 'de Campos-Lima PO', 'Olszewska M', 'Kamen A', 'Riviere I', 'Caruso M']","[""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de l'Universite Laval, L'Hotel Dieu de Quebec, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA-023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA086438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",2009/05/21 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/05/21 09:00'],"['2009/05/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2009.001 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2009 Sep;20(9):966-74. doi: 10.1089/hum.2009.001.,10.1089/hum.2009.001 [doi],PMC2861952,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leucocyte positional parameters, which may diagnose specific diseases (e.g. differentiate between abnormal lymphocytes in leukaemia and viral conditions and may also detect malarial infection) are now available. At this time they are only used for research; however, generally such parameters later become reportable. One manufacturer's routine analyser allows measurement of cells by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies. Currently, there are no accredited external quality assessment schemes (EQAS) for these parameters. For a number of parameters, on some instruments, there is no internal quality control, which brings into question whether these parameters should be used for clinical decision making. Other more established parameters, such as mean platelet volume, red cell distribution width and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate do not have EQAS available.

METHODS: The median follow-up of survivors was 2.3 years. A total of 70 (73%) patients achieved a morphologic complete remission (CR) confirmed by absence of leukemic blasts by flow cytometry. RESULTS: For all 96 patients, the median event-free survival (EFS) was 8 months, and overall survival (OS) was 13.6 months (range, 1-119 months). Eight patients died shortly after induction therapy because of disease or side effects, and 13 are currently in continuous first remission. The median disease-free survival (DFS) for all 70 patients who achieved a morphologic CR was 9 months (range, 1-51 months), with a 64% chance of surviving 1 year. Patients with AML after previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy had a higher morphologic remission rate compared with those arising from myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disease (82% vs 62%; P = .027). However, among the patients from the 2 groups who attained a morphologic remission, there was no difference in terms of CR rate (P = .94), DFS, EFS, or OS (P = .55, .83, and .71, respectively). This is a similar DFS to the group of 7 patients who went directly to ablative allogeneic transplant rather than having induction therapy first. In this population of patients who received aggressive chemotherapy, Charlson comorbidity index or a higher number of factors recognized as high risk in leukemia patients did not affect the chance of OS, DFS, and EFS, although having more recognized leukemia risk factors was related to a lower chance of surviving 1 year. However, it is important to note that those with higher comorbidity indexes were underrepresented in this aggressively treated cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study demonstrate that many patients with sAML can tolerate aggressive induction therapy and attain remission, but duration of response and the chance of long-term survival remain poor.","['Rizzieri, David A', ""O'Brien, Jenny A"", 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Decastro, Carlos M', 'Dev, Prakash', 'Diehl, Louis', 'Beaven, Anne', 'Lagoo, Anand', 'Gockerman, Jon P', 'Chao, Nelson J', 'Moore, Joseph O']","['Rizzieri DA', ""O'Brien JA"", 'Broadwater G', 'Decastro CM', 'Dev P', 'Diehl L', 'Beaven A', 'Lagoo A', 'Gockerman JP', 'Chao NJ', 'Moore JO']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Cellular Therapy, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. rizzi003@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24379 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Jul 1;115(13):2922-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24379.,10.1002/cncr.24379 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, few population-based studies of AML treatment patterns and outcomes exist to date. METHODS: The authors used the Ontario Cancer Registry to identify all patients diagnosed with AML between 1965 and 2003. Referral to specialized cancer centers (SCCs) and receipt of chemotherapy were examined as quality of care indicators. Survival outcomes were examined using logistic regression at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 9365 patients (mean age, 58.1 years; range, 0 to 103 years) developed AML between 1965 and 2003. Overall, 75.1%, 32.9%, and 17.3% of patients survived to 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively. Although survival improved over time among patients aged 19 to 59 years, similar improvements were not seen among older patients. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy declined with age (59.0% vs 29.3% among patients ages 19-59 vs > or =60 years). Fewer patients aged > or =60 years were referred to a SCC compared with younger patients (20.8% vs 29.9%). Younger age, less comorbidity, later year of diagnosis, receipt of chemotherapy, and being referred to a SCC were associated with better 30-day and long-term survival in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prognosis has improved over time among younger adults, it remains poor among those aged > or =60 years. Fewer older patients were referred to SCCs or treated with chemotherapy compared with younger patients, whereas both factors were associated with improved survival. Opportunities may exist to improve the quality of care and outcomes among older adults with AML.","['Alibhai, Shabbir M H', 'Leach, Marc', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Brandwein, Joseph']","['Alibhai SM', 'Leach M', 'Minden MD', 'Brandwein J']","['Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. shabbir.alibhai@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Quality of Health Care', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24373 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2009 Jul 1;115(13):2903-11. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24373.,10.1002/cncr.24373 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have evaluated the dHPLC screening method and direct sequencing for the detection of GATA1 mutations in peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates samples from children with Down syndrome (DS). Cases were ascertained consecutively as part of an epidemiological study of DS and hematological disorders in Brazil. A total of 130 samples corresponding to 115 children with DS were analysed using dHPLC and direct sequencing methods to detect mutations in GATA1 exons 2, 3 and 4 gene sequences. The overall detection rate of sequencing and dHPLC screening methods was similar. Twenty mutations were detected in exon 2 and one mutation in exon 3 (c.231_232 dupGT) sequences of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and transient leukemia samples. Four GATA1 mutations were newly described [c.155C > G; c.156_178 del23 bp; c.29_30 del GG; c.182C > A and c.151A > T,c.153_162 del 10 bp). Out of four, three had single nucleotide change.

In the present study, we analysed the mechanism behind T(reg) cells expansion in CLL. Neither analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire nor CD45 isoform expression of T(reg) cells from patients with CLL provided evidence for chronic (tumor) antigenic stimulation as a possible cause for T(reg) cells expansion in CLL. We found evidence however for increased formation of T(reg) cells via CD70 costimulation, because we observed that CD40 ligand activated CLL cells (which might be considered a model of lymph node CLL cells) strongly induced CD70-dependent formation of T(reg) cells. Reverse transcription-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay expression analysis of 34 apoptosis-regulating genes showed that in comparison with other CD4(+) T-cells, T(reg) cells from both healthy individuals (HD) and patients with CLL had a high expression of pro-apoptotic Noxa and a low expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Strikingly, Bcl-2 levels of T(reg) cells in patients with CLL were significantly higher than in HD. Finally, the different apoptotic profile resulted in differences at the functional level, because T(reg) cells from patients with CLL were more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis than T(reg) cells from HD. In conclusion, T(reg) cells in CLL may accumulate both by increased formation, facilitated by CD27-CD70 interaction in the lymph node proliferation centres, and decreased sensitivity to apoptosis because of a shifted Noxa-Bcl-2 balance.","['Jak, Margot', 'Mous, Rogier', 'Remmerswaal, Ester B M', 'Spijker, Rene', 'Jaspers, Annelieke', 'Yague, Adriana', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Van Lier, Rene A W', 'Van Oers, Marinus H J']","['Jak M', 'Mous R', 'Remmerswaal EB', 'Spijker R', 'Jaspers A', 'Yague A', 'Eldering E', 'Van Lier RA', 'Van Oers MH']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.jak@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'CD27 Ligand/*metabolism/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/metabolism']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']","['911406148 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902803677 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 May;50(5):788-801. doi: 10.1080/10428190902803677.,10.1080/10428190902803677 [doi],,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 May;50(5):687-8.

B-cell-activating factor (BAFF, also known as BlyS or B-lymphocyte stimulator) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), the two members of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily, enhance the production of antibodies and regulate and promote proliferation and survival. Both BAFF and APRIL have an important role in B cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival. This study evaluates the expression of BAFF, APRIL, and their three receptors in two human MM cell lines (KM3 and PRMI 8226) and ten primary MM cell lines, and their effects on the growth of MM cells in vivo. MM cells were found to express BAFF, APRIL, and their three receptor genes both at the gene and protein levels. ELISA found high concentrations of BAFF and APRIL in the supernatants of these cultured cells. Treatment with PS-341 decreased the concentration of BAFF and APRIL. The WST-1 analysis of growth found that BAFF and APRIL stimulated the proliferation of MM cells. PS-341 inhibited this enhanced proliferation and induced apoptosis. Making use of the rhTACI-Fc to block the BAFF- and APRIL-induced activation of NF-kappaB2, we demonstrated that the NF-kappaB2-p52/RelB signal contributes to MM cell survival. In summary, PS-341 was shown to block this pathway. PS-341 inhibits the autocrine secretion of BAFF and APRIL and thereby MM cell proliferation by the alterative NF-kappaB2 pathway. BAFF and APRIL appear to be the targets of PS-341.","['Li, Wuping', 'Li, Juan', 'Su, Chang', 'Zou, Wai Yi', 'Luo, Shaokai']","['Li W', 'Li J', 'Su C', 'Zou WY', 'Luo S']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong Shan Road II, Guangzhou 510080, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090519,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (PDS5B protein, human)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*trends', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/05/20 09:00,2011/01/13 06:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9230-z [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Jun;27(2):439-45. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9230-z.

Epidemiological data evidence that the NBS1 gene can be considered a susceptibility factor for cancer development, as demonstrated by the fact that almost 40% of NBS patients have developed a malignancy before the age of 21. Interestingly, also NBS1 heterozygotes, which are clinically asymptomatic, display an elevated risk to develop some types of malignant tumours, especially breast, prostate and colorectal cancers, lymphoblastic leukaemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). So far, nine mutations in the NBS1 gene have been found, at the heterozygous state, in cancer patients. Among them, the 657del5, the I171V and the R215W mutations are the most frequently described. The pathogenicity of these mutations is presumably connected with their occurrence in the highly conserved BRCT tandem domains of the NBS1 protein, which are present in a large superfamily of proteins, and are recognized as major mediators of processes related to cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair.This review will focus on the current state-of-knowledge regarding the correlation between carriers of NBS1 gene mutations and the proneness to the development of malignant tumours.","['di Masi, Alessandra', 'Antoccia, Antonio']","['di Masi A', 'Antoccia A']","['Department of Biology, University ""Roma Tre"", Viale Guglielmo Marconi 446, I-00146 Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Genomics,Current genomics,100960527,,,,2009/05/20 09:00,2009/05/20 09:01,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:01 [medline]']",['10.2174/138920208784533610 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Genomics. 2008 Jun;9(4):275-81. doi: 10.2174/138920208784533610.,10.2174/138920208784533610 [doi],PMC2682932,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['657del5 mutation', 'I171V mutation', 'IVS11+2insT mutation', 'NBS1', 'R215W mutation', 'breast cancer', 'cancer predisposition', 'colorectal cancer.', 'heterozygous', 'lymphoma', 'prostate cancer']",,,,

In this report, we identify a gene expression signature that is specific to M3 samples; it was not found in other AML subtypes and did not simply represent the normal gene expression pattern of primary promyelocytes. To validate this signature for a large number of genes, we tested a recently developed high throughput digital technology (NanoString nCounter). Nearly all of the genes tested demonstrated highly significant concordance with our microarray data (P < 0.05). The validated gene signature reliably identified M3 samples in 2 other AML datasets, and the validated genes were substantially enriched in our mouse model of APL, but not in a cell line that inducibly expressed PML-RARA.

However, no tools currently exist to systematically connect such genetic lesions to therapeutic vulnerability. We have therefore developed a genomics approach to identify lesions associated with therapeutically relevant oncogene dependency. Using integrated genomic profiling, we have demonstrated that the genomes of a large panel of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines are highly representative of those of primary NSCLC tumors. Using cell-based compound screening coupled with diverse computational approaches to integrate orthogonal genomic and biochemical data sets, we identified molecular and genomic predictors of therapeutic response to clinically relevant compounds. Using this approach, we showed that v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations confer enhanced Hsp90 dependency and validated this finding in mice with KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma, as these mice exhibited dramatic tumor regression when treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor. In addition, we found that cells with copy number enhancement of v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ABL2) and ephrin receptor kinase and v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian) (SRC) kinase family genes were exquisitely sensitive to treatment with the SRC/ABL inhibitor dasatinib, both in vitro and when it xenografted into mice. Thus, genomically annotated cell-line collections may help translate cancer genomics information into clinical practice by defining critical pathway dependencies amenable to therapeutic inhibition.","['Sos, Martin L', 'Michel, Kathrin', 'Zander, Thomas', 'Weiss, Jonathan', 'Frommolt, Peter', 'Peifer, Martin', 'Li, Danan', 'Ullrich, Roland', 'Koker, Mirjam', 'Fischer, Florian', 'Shimamura, Takeshi', 'Rauh, Daniel', 'Mermel, Craig', 'Fischer, Stefanie', 'Stuckrath, Isabel', 'Heynck, Stefanie', 'Beroukhim, Rameen', 'Lin, William', 'Winckler, Wendy', 'Shah, Kinjal', 'LaFramboise, Thomas', 'Moriarty, Whei F', 'Hanna, Megan', 'Tolosi, Laura', 'Rahnenfuhrer, Jorg', 'Verhaak, Roel', 'Chiang, Derek', 'Getz, Gad', 'Hellmich, Martin', 'Wolf, Jurgen', 'Girard, Luc', 'Peyton, Michael', 'Weir, Barbara A', 'Chen, Tzu-Hsiu', 'Greulich, Heidi', 'Barretina, Jordi', 'Shapiro, Geoffrey I', 'Garraway, Levi A', 'Gazdar, Adi F', 'Minna, John D', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Wong, Kwok-Kin', 'Thomas, Roman K']","['Sos ML', 'Michel K', 'Zander T', 'Weiss J', 'Frommolt P', 'Peifer M', 'Li D', 'Ullrich R', 'Koker M', 'Fischer F', 'Shimamura T', 'Rauh D', 'Mermel C', 'Fischer S', 'Stuckrath I', 'Heynck S', 'Beroukhim R', 'Lin W', 'Winckler W', 'Shah K', 'LaFramboise T', 'Moriarty WF', 'Hanna M', 'Tolosi L', 'Rahnenfuhrer J', 'Verhaak R', 'Chiang D', 'Getz G', 'Hellmich M', 'Wolf J', 'Girard L', 'Peyton M', 'Weir BA', 'Chen TH', 'Greulich H', 'Barretina J', 'Shapiro GI', 'Garraway LA', 'Gazdar AF', 'Minna JD', 'Meyerson M', 'Wong KK', 'Thomas RK']","['Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research, Klaus-Joachim-Zulch Laboratories of Max Planck Society, and University of Koln Medical Faculty, University of Koln, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA122794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA090578/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA070907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA70907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007753/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG2400401/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090518,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'ErbB Receptors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Substrate Specificity']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['37127 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI37127 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2009 Jun;119(6):1727-40. doi: 10.1172/JCI37127.

We have previously demonstrated that, during S-phase arrest, cAMP inhibits the action of S phase-specific cytotoxic compounds, leading to reduction in their apoptotic response. In this report, we provide evidence that cAMP can also inhibit the action of DNA-damaging agents independently of its effect on S phase. Elevation of cAMP in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells is shown to profoundly inhibit the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation, anthracyclins, alkylating agents, and platinum compounds. We further demonstrate that this effect depends on the ability of elevated cAMP levels to quench DNA damage-induced p53 accumulation by increasing the p53 turnover, resulting in attenuated Puma and Bax induction, mitochondrial outer membrane depolarization, caspase activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that cAMP levels may influence p53 function in malignant cells that retain wild-type p53, potentially affecting p53 both as a tumor suppressor during cancer initiation and maintenance, and as an effector of the apoptotic response to DNA-damaging agents during anticancer treatment.","['Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Findley, Harry W', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil', 'Naderi, Soheil']","['Naderi EH', 'Findley HW', 'Ruud E', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Naderi S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo/Universitetet i Oslo, Blindern, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090518,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37058-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-204883 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 16;114(3):608-18. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-204883.

PATIENTS AND METHODS MN1 expression was measured in 119 untreated primary CN-AML adults younger than 60 years by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Patients were also tested for FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and WT1 mutations, MLL partial tandem duplications, and BAALC and ERG expression. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles were attained by performing genome-wide microarray assays. Patients were intensively treated on two first-line Cancer and Leukemia Group B clinical trials. Results Higher MN1 expression associated with NPM1 wild-type (P < .001), increased BAALC expression (P = .004), and less extramedullary involvement (P = .01). In multivariable analyses, higher MN1 expression associated with a lower complete remission rate (P = .005) after adjustment for WBC; shorter disease-free survival (P = .01) after adjustment for WT1 mutations, FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), and high ERG expression; and shorter survival (P = .04) after adjustment for WT1 and NPM1 mutations, FLT3-ITD, and WBC. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles suggested that high MN1 expressers share features with high BAALC expressers and patients with wild-type NPM1. Higher MN1 expression also appears to be associated with genes and microRNAs that are active in aberrant macrophage/monocytoid function and differentiation. CONCLUSION MN1 expression independently predicts outcome in CN-AML patients. The MN1 gene- and microRNA-expression signatures suggest biologic features that could be exploited as therapeutic targets.","['Langer, Christian', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Holland, Kelsi B', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Langer C', 'Marcucci G', 'Holland KB', 'Radmacher MD', 'Maharry K', 'Paschka P', 'Whitman SP', 'Mrozek K', 'Baldus CD', 'Vij R', 'Powell BL', 'Carroll AJ', 'Kolitz JE', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Suite A434 Starling-Loving Hall, 320 W 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090518,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.6110 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.6110 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jul 1;27(19):3198-204. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.6110.

In the case of PML/RARA, this repression can be reversed through treatment with all-trans RA (ATRA), leading to leukemic remission. However, PLZF/RARA ectopic repression is insensitive to ATRA, resulting in persistence of the leukemic diseased state after treatment, a phenomenon that is still poorly understood. Here we show that, like PML/RARA, PLZF/RARA expression leads to recruitment of the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) Polycomb group (PcG) complex to RA response elements. However, unlike PML/RARA, PLZF/RARA directly interacts with the PcG protein Bmi-1 and forms a stable component of the PRC1 PcG complex, resulting in PLZF/RARA-dependent ectopic recruitment of PRC1 to RA response elements. Upon treatment with ATRA, ectopic recruitment of PRC2 by either PML/RARA or PLZF/RARA is lost, whereas PRC1 recruited by PLZF/RARA remains, resulting in persistent RA-insensitive gene repression. We further show that Bmi-1 is essential for the PLZF/RARA cellular transformation property and implicates a central role for PRC1 in PLZF/RARA-mediated myeloid leukemic development.","['Boukarabila, Hanane', 'Saurin, Andrew J', 'Batsche, Eric', 'Mossadegh, Noushine', 'van Lohuizen, Maarten', 'Otte, Arie P', 'Pradel, Jacques', 'Muchardt, Christian', 'Sieweke, Michael', 'Duprez, Estelle']","['Boukarabila H', 'Saurin AJ', 'Batsche E', 'Mossadegh N', 'van Lohuizen M', 'Otte AP', 'Pradel J', 'Muchardt C', 'Sieweke M', 'Duprez E']","[""Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Universite de la Mediterranee, Campus de Luminy, 13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']","['23/10/1195 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.512009 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2009 May 15;23(10):1195-206. doi: 10.1101/gad.512009.,10.1101/gad.512009 [doi],PMC2685534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that the frame genotypes of KIR2DL4, 3DL2, 3DL3 and 3DP1 were expressed in all patients and all controls. The genotypes of KIR2DL1, 2DL3, 3DL1, and 2DP1 were most prevalent genotypes whose rates were more than 95% in all patients and all controls. The rate of activating KIR2DS4 was much higher in patients with CML than that in healthy controls (P<0.001) while the activating KIR2DS3 was lower in patients with ALL compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). There was no significant change of KIR genes found in patients with NALL. In conclusion, this study suggests that the activating KIR2DS4 may serve as CML susceptive gene to trigger leukemia development, while KIR2DS3 is possibly a protect gene of ALL.","['Zhang, Yan', 'Wang, Bo', 'Ye, Shihui', 'Liu, Sheng', 'Liu, Mengli', 'Shen, Chunmei', 'Teng, Yan', 'Qi, Jun']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang B', 'Ye S', 'Liu S', 'Liu M', 'Shen C', 'Teng Y', 'Qi J']","[""Department of Blood Group Research, Shaan'xi Province Blood Center, Xi'an, Shaan'xi, China. zhyan6200@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090518,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics']",2009/05/20 09:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00215-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.04.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jan;34(1):55-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.04.022.

Between 1997 and 2002, 152 children transplanted for acute leukemia (102), myelodysplastic syndromes (23), chronic myelogenous leukemia (20), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7) were enrolled in the study and randomized to receive either early CsA (group 1, N = 72) or conventional CsA (group 2, N = 80), after stratification according to HLA compatibility and disease phase. The cumulative incidence of both grade II-IV and grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD), as well as of chronic GVHD (cGVHD), did not differ between the 2 groups. No significant differences were observed also with regard to TRM and RR. The 8-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of EFS were 56% in group 1, and 46% in group 2 (P = NS). In the Cox model, advanced disease phase, male recipient, older donor, and occurrence of grade III-IV aGVHD predicted inferior overall EFS.

Patients (n = 103) with a variable risk for AML who received uHSCTs from available Asian and Caucasian donors were enrolled. First, we compared HLA-matched (group 1, n = 54) and HLA-mismatched (group 2, n = 49) transplantation patients. Then, we divided the patients in group 2, who had received transplants from allele(s)/antigen-mismatched donors, into 2 subgroups: patients who used ATG (group 3, n = 24) and those who did not (group 4, n = 25). To prevent the development of aGVHD, the patients in group 3 received ATG at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg body weight per day for 2 consecutive days, together with our standard regimen of methotrexate (MTX) and tacrolimus. The median CD34(+) cell infusion was 4.2 x 10(6)/kg (range: 1.2-34.4). The median patient age was 41 years (range: 16-57), and the median follow-up duration of patients who were event-free survivors was 23 months (range: 2-72). The overall incidences of aGVHD and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were 38% and 56%, respectively. Of 48 evaluable patients in group 2, 10 (21%) developed moderate to severe aGVHD (grades II-IV). In contrast, 2 (8%) of the 24 patients in group 3 and 7 (29%) of the 24 evaluated patients in group 4 required therapy for aGVHD (grades II-IV; P = .038). The incidence of cGVHD was not different between groups 3 and 4. The estimated probabilities of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years for group 2 were 55% and 44%, respectively. In comparison, the estimated probabilities of OS and EFS at 2 years for groups 3 and 4 were 68% versus 38% (P = .043) and 58% versus 38% (P = .103), respectively. The overall cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 29% in group 2. The cumulative incidence of NRM differed markedly between group 3 (16%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-28%) and group 4 (44%, 95% CI, 34%-54%) (P = .013). We found no difference in cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation between groups 3 and 4. These results suggest that in mismatched uHSCT, a low dose of ATG (total 2.5 mg/kg) may prevent moderate to severe aGVHD, with comparable rates of relapse and CMV reactivation and a greatly decreased rate of NRM.","['Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Lee, Seok', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Jin, Jong-Youl', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Kim, Chun-Choo']","['Kim HJ', 'Min WS', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Min CK', 'Lee S', 'Cho SG', 'Jin JY', 'Lee JW', 'Kim CC']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090409,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*surgery', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/20 09:00,2009/09/29 06:00,['2009/05/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00124-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Jun;15(6):704-17. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.02.010.

This young age has been reported to correlate with improved survival in patients with MM. The objective of this study is to describe presenting features and outcomes of patients < or =40 years of age with MM who undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as first-line treatment, and compare overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) to patients aged 41-65 years. We performed a retrospective institutional review of all patients < or =40 years of age and 41-65 years of age at the time of diagnosis of MM who had undergone upfront ASCT from January 1, 1990, to July 31, 2007. Thirty-eight patients < or =40 years of age and 608 patients aged 41-65 were identified. There was a high rate of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) in young patients at 11% compared to the reported rate of 2%-4%. At diagnosis, there was an increased rate of renal failure in the young cohort compared to patients aged 41-65 years at 25% versus 16% and Bence Jones proteinuria at 81% versus 51%. The rate of complete or partial response was similar between the groups at 79% and 83% in the young and older cohorts, respectively. Median PFS post-ASCT was 22.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.1, 28.0), versus 26.9 months (95% CI: 24.0, 29.8) for patients aged 41-65 years (P = .66). Median OS from date of ASCT was also similar to those over 40 years: 68.1 months (95% CI: 39.0, 97.2) versus 80.7 months (95% CI: 68.1, 93.4); P = .90. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was low at 2.6% and 2.3% in the young and older cohorts, respectively. Despite previous reports that young age is a positive prognostic marker, our study found OS post-ASCT is equivalent to those aged 41-65 years.

Anti-proliferative effect of PMF on HL60 cells was associated with G2/M cell cycle arrest, which was mediated by regulating the expression of Cdc25C, cyclin A and p21 proteins and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Thr161. PMF also induced apoptosis of HL60 cells via death receptor and mitochondria apoptotic pathways, which was characterized by DNA fragmentation, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, changes of Bcl-2 and Bax expression, cytochrome c release from mitochondria and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).

METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the additional cost of imatinib versus MUD-SCT per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was chosen as a target assessment. ICER was quantified using a Markov cohort modelling approach. The evaluation encompassed 5 years of treatment with either approach, and only direct medical costs (in euro, year 2005) were considered. RESULTS: There were incremental costs of euro77,410 for imatinib therapy per QALY gained versus MUD-SCT. No strategy was clearly dominant; on average, during 5 years, cost savings of euro63,433 were obtained and 0.82 QALY lost by SCT compared to treatment with imatinib. QALYs gained in CML patients with either treatment resulted in considerable cost to the third-party payer in Germany. The results were particularly sensitive to the price of imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis finds that imatinib is more costly but more effective (as measured in QALYs) over a 5-year time horizon.

The purpose of the present studies was to focus on the in vivo effects of quercetin on leukemia WEHI-3 cells. The effects of quercetin on WEHI-3 cells injected into BALB/c mice were examined. Quercetin decreased the percentage of Mac-3 and CD11b markers, suggesting that the differentiation of the precursors of macrophages and T cells was inhibited. There was no effect on CD3 levels but increased CD19 levels. Quercetin decreased the weight of the spleen and liver compared with the olive oil treated animals. Quercetin stimulated macrophage phagocytosis of cells isolated from peritoneum. Quercetin also promoted natural killer cell activity.

Since it causes important toxic effects in workers exposed to low levels, long-term exposure to this compound has been extensively studied. Leukemia, blood disorders, bone marrow depression, and some types of cancer are directly related to benzene-initiated toxicity. Bioactivation of benzene can lead to the formation of hazardous metabolites such as phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol. Catechol forms semiquinones and reactive quinones that are presumed to play an important role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS formation can directly induce single and double strand breaks in the DNA, oxidized nucleotides, and hyper-recombination, and consequently produces deleterious genetic changes.

Excessive egress of leukemia cell blasts results in invasion into various organs or tissues, which is facilitated by the catalytic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). However, the migration of chemoresistant leukemia cells remains unclear. Here, we generated drug-resistant variants of the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line (AML-2/WT) by stepwise exposure to anticancer drugs and evaluated the level of MMP-2 in the drug-resistant variants, along with their invasiveness. Each of the drug-resistant cell variants demonstrated predominant increases in the expression and gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 as well as in invasiveness, which were significantly suppressed by both a MMP-2 inhibitor and a blocking antibody. Knockdown experiments using MMP-2 short hairpin RNA also indicated that its upregulation was strongly associated with the cells' increased invasive properties. Importantly, elevated levels of MMP-2 activity and invasiveness were observed in ex vivo mononuclear cell of bone marrow from patients with poor responses to chemotherapy. These findings suggest that advanced malignancy due to acquired drug resistance is responsible for the progressive invasiveness of leukemia cells via MMP-2.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Cho, Daeho', 'Lee, Il-Kwon', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Kim SH', 'Cho D', 'Lee IK', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim TS']","['Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0', ""(1',3-dihydro-1'-(2-carboxyethyl)-3,3-dimethyl-6-nitrospiro-(2H-1-benzopyran-2,2'"", '-(2H)-indoline))', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24386 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Sep 1;125(5):1074-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24386.,10.1002/ijc.24386 [doi],,,,,,,,['2009 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we surveyed several nuclear structures in pluripotent and transitioning hESC. Observations of centromeres, telomeres, SC35 speckles, Cajal Bodies, lamin A/C and emerin, nuclear shape and size demonstrate a very different ""nuclear landscape"" in hESC. This landscape is remodeled during a brief transitional window, concomitant with or just prior to differentiation onset. Notably, hESC initially contain abundant signal for spliceosome assembly factor, SC35, but lack discrete SC35 domains; these form as cells begin to specialize, likely reflecting cell-type specific genomic organization. Concomitantly, nuclear size increases and shape changes as lamin A/C and emerin incorporate into the lamina. During this brief window, hESC exhibit dramatically different PML-defined structures, which in somatic cells are linked to gene regulation and cancer. Unlike the numerous, spherical somatic PML bodies, hES cells often display approximately 1-3 large PML structures of two morphological types: long linear ""rods"" or elaborate ""rosettes"", which lack substantial SUMO-1, Daxx, and Sp100. These occur primarily between Day 0-2 of differentiation and become rare thereafter. PML rods may be ""taut"" between other structures, such as centromeres, but clearly show some relationship with the lamina, where PML often abuts or fills a ""gap"" in early lamin A/C staining. Findings demonstrate that pluripotent hES cells have a markedly different overall nuclear architecture, remodeling of which is linked to early epigenomic programming and involves formation of unique PML-defined structures.","['Butler, John T', 'Hall, Lisa L', 'Smith, Kelly P', 'Lawrence, Jeanne B']","['Butler JT', 'Hall LL', 'Smith KP', 'Lawrence JB']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM68138/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM068138-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053234/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM068138/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM53234/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053234-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology/pathology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22183 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Jul 1;107(4):609-21. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22183.,10.1002/jcb.22183 [doi],PMC2937361,['NIHMS137001'],57,,,,,"['2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnostic accuracy of the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria, Amor criteria, and the combination of them in these misdiagnosed cases was also analyzed. The final diagnoses of these 24 cases were listed below: four malignant tumors (retroperitoneal adipose sarcoma, advanced gastric carcinoma, ovarian papillary epithelioma, acute lymphocytic leukemia), six benign tumors (two parathyroid adenoma with hyperparathyroidism, one intraspinal lipoma, intraspinal ependymomas, sacral tubulocyst, and intraspinal schwannoglioma, respectively).

Among patients with tumor, all except three patients had persistent low back pain without morning stiffness, which aggravated at night and could not be relieved by rest or exercise. The symptoms could not be relieved by administration of multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Eleven patients had inflammatory low back pain defined by Calin.

However, for leukemic cells little is known about the expression of TLR7/8 and the direct effects of their agonists. We hypothesized that TLR7/8 agonist treatment of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells would lead to an increased immunogenicity of AML cells. We observed expression of TLR7 and TLR8 in primary human AML cells and AML cell lines. Passive pulsing of primary AML cells with the TLR7/8 agonist R-848 resulted in increased expression of MHC molecules, production of proinflammatory cytokines, and enhanced allogeneic naive T cell-stimulatory capacity. These effects were absent or suboptimal if R-848 was administered intracellularly by electroporation. Furthermore, when AML cells were cocultured with allogeneic PBMC in the presence of R-848, interferon (IFN)-gamma was produced by allogeneic NK and NKT cells and AML cells were killed. In conclusion, the immunostimulatory effect of the TLR7/8 agonist R-848 on human AML cells could prove useful for the design of TLR-based immunotherapy for leukemia.","['Smits, Evelien L J M', 'Cools, Nathalie', 'Lion, Eva', 'Van Camp, Kirsten', 'Ponsaerts, Peter', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F I']","['Smits EL', 'Cools N', 'Lion E', 'Van Camp K', 'Ponsaerts P', 'Berneman ZN', 'Van Tendeloo VF']","['Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (VIDI), Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium. evelien.smits@uza.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090516,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', 'V3DMU7PVXF (resiquimod)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/*agonists/biosynthesis', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/*agonists/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0721-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Jan;59(1):35-46. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0721-8.

As karyotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism-based mapping analysis identify a minimal common deletion region involving the 1p21 locus, we investigated the prevalence and prognostic significance of del(1p21) in 203 MM patients undergoing high-dose therapy and autologous SCT. 1p21 status was also evaluated in 16 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and 41 patients with plasma cell leukemia (PCL). FISH combined with cytoplasmic light chain detection (cIg-FISH) detected hemizygous 1p21 deletions in 18% of the MM, 34% of PCL but none of the MGUS cases.

We tested 106 consecutive DLBCL treated with R-CHOP21 for 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 15 genes potentially relevant to rituximab-CHOP (R-CHOP) pharmacogenetics. Associations of SNPs with event-free survival (EFS) and toxicity were controlled for multiple testing. Genotypic variants of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase p22phox (CYBA rs4673) and alpha1 class glutathione S-transferase (GSTA1 rs3957357) were independent predictors of EFS (CYBA rs4673 TT genotype: HR 2.06, P=0.038; GSTA1 rs3957357 CT/TT genotypes: HR 0.38, P=0.003), after adjusting for International Prognostic Index (IPI). CYBA rs4673 and GSTA1 rs3957357 also predicted outcome in DLBCL subgroups by IPI. Impact of SNPs on toxicity was evaluated in 658 R-CHOP21 courses utilizing generalized estimating equations. NCF4 rs1883112 was an independent predictor against hematologic (odds ratios (OR): 0.45; P=0.018), infectious (OR: 0.46; P=0.003) and cardiac toxicity (OR: 0.37; P=0.023). Overall, host SNPs affecting doxorubicin pharmacodynamics (CYBA rs4673) and alkylator detoxification (GSTA1 rs3957357) may predict outcome in R-CHOP21-treated DLBCL. Also, NCF4 rs1883112, a SNP of NAD(P)H oxidase p40phox, may have a function in protecting against hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.

Differentially expressed proteins were separated and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting analysis and bioinformatics, and verified by western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: As compared with those in untreated HL-60 cells, 29 proteins were differentially expressed in DADS-treated HL-60 cells: 22 were upregulated and seven were downregulated. Among nine proteins which were randomly selected for peptide mass fingerprinting analysis and bioinformatics, seven were meaningful. These proteins were associated with cellular responses, gene transcription and regulation, cytoskeleton, metabolism, and so on. western blot showed that Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (Rac2) was upregulated in DADS-treated HL-60 cells; this result was accordant with RT-PCR results.

This study was to investigate the effects of a JAK inhibitor, AG490, on the proliferation, apoptosis, and expressions of apoptosis-related survivin and Mcl-1 genes, thus to explore the role of JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway in the regulation of cell apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line CNE-2Z. METHODS: CNE-2Z cells were treated with different doses of AG490. The cell proliferation was measured using MTT array. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) and Hoechst33342 fluorescence staining. The mRNA levels of STAT3, survivin and Mcl-1 were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein contents of STAT3, phosphoralated STAT3 (p-STAT3), survivin and Mcl-1 were measured by western blot. RESULTS: The inhibition rates of CNE-2Z cell proliferation by 100 micromol/L AG490 were 37.95% and 52.99% at 24 and 48 h after treatment. After incubation with 50 micromol/L and 100 micromol/L AG490 for 24 h, the apoptotic rates of CNE-2Z cells were increased from 1.37% to 9.30% and 9.00%, respectively (p < 0.01); typical changes in apoptotic morphology were observed under fluorescence microscopy; moreover, activation of STAT3 was inhibited, mRNA and protein levels of Mcl-1 and survivin were down-regulated.

Studies show that ELL indirectly modulates transcription by serving as a regulator for transcriptional elongation as well as for p53, U19/Eaf2, and steroid receptor activities. Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that ELL could also serve as a transcriptional factor to directly induce transcription of the thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) gene. Experiments using ELL deletion mutants established that full-length ELL is required for the TSP-1 up-regulation and that the transactivation domain likely resides in the carboxyl terminus. Moreover, the DNA binding domain may localize to the first 45 amino acids of ELL. Not surprisingly, multiple lineage leukemia-ELL, which lacks these amino acids, did not induce expression from the TSP-1 promoter. In addition, the ELL core-response element appears to localize in the -1426 to -1418 region of the TSP-1 promoter. Finally, studies using zebrafish confirmed that ELL regulates TSP-1 mRNA expression in vivo, and ELL could inhibit zebrafish vasculogenesis, at least in part, through up-regulating TSP-1. Given the importance of TSP-1 as an anti-angiogenic protein, our findings may have important ramifications for better understanding cancer.","['Zhou, Jiangang', 'Feng, Xi', 'Ban, Bin', 'Liu, Jingxia', 'Wang, Zhou', 'Xiao, Wuhan']","['Zhou J', 'Feng X', 'Ban B', 'Liu J', 'Wang Z', 'Xiao W']","['Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Conservation of Aquatic Organisms, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090515,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Thrombospondin 1)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Thrombospondin 1/*biosynthesis', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Zebrafish']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/09/02 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)81246-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.010439 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Jul 10;284(28):19142-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.010439.

Macrophages are key players in the inflammatory response and atherosclerosis formation. We have previously shown that HIV PIs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), and increase the synthesis of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-6, by regulating the intracellular translocation of RNA binding protein HuR in macrophages. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms remain unclear. We show here that the HIV PI lopinavir significantly activated the extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase (ERK), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. Lopinavir-induced cytosolic translocation of HuR and TNF-alpha and IL-6 synthesis was attenuated by specific chemical inhibitor of MEK (PD98058) or over-expression of dominant negative mutant of MEK1. In addition, we demonstrated that lopinavir-induced ERK activation and TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression were completely inhibited in macrophages from CHOP null mice. Taken together, these results indicate activation of the UPR plays an essential role in HIV PI-induced inflammatory cytokine synthesis and release by activating ERK, which increases the cytosolic translocation of HuR and subsequent binding to the 3'UTR of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNAs in macrophages.","['Chen, Li', 'Jarujaron, Sirikalaya', 'Wu, Xudong', 'Sun, Lixin', 'Zha, Weibin', 'Liang, Guang', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Gurley, Emily C', 'Studer, Elaine J', 'Hylemon, Phillip B', 'Pandak, William M Jr', 'Zhang, Luyong', 'Wang, Guangji', 'Li, Xiaokun', 'Dent, Paul', 'Zhou, Huiping']","['Chen L', 'Jarujaron S', 'Wu X', 'Sun L', 'Zha W', 'Liang G', 'Wang X', 'Gurley EC', 'Studer EJ', 'Hylemon PB', 'Pandak WM Jr', 'Zhang L', 'Wang G', 'Li X', 'Dent P', 'Zhou H']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI057189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI068432-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI068432/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK38030/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AT004148-01/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AT004148/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK038030/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090331,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '2494G1JF75 (Lopinavir)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lopinavir', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00193-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jul 1;78(1):70-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.022.

Here we showed that 2-ME2 inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat leukemia cells by markedly suppressing the levels of cyclins D3 and E, E2F1 and p21(Cip1/Waf1) and up-regulating p16(INK4A). Further, 2-ME2 induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells in association with down-regulation and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (as mediated by JNK), up-regulation of Bak, activation of caspases-9 and -3 and PARP-1 cleavage. To determine the importance and mechanistic role of Bcl-2 in this process, we enforced its expression in Jurkat cells by retroviral transduction. Enforcing Bcl-2 expression in Jurkat cells abolished 2-ME2-induced apoptosis and instead produced a G1/S phase cell cycle arrest in association with markedly increased levels of p27(Kip1). Bcl-2 and p27(Kip1) were localized mainly in the nucleus in these apoptotic resistant cells. Interestingly, NF-kappaB activity and p50 levels were increased by 2-ME2 and suppression of NF-kappaB signaling reduced p27(Kip1) expression and sensitized cells to 2-ME2-induced apoptosis. Importantly, knocking-down p27(Kip1) in Jurkat Bcl-2 cells sensitized them to spontaneous and 2-ME2-induced apoptosis. Thus, Bcl-2 prevented the 2-ME2-induced apoptotic response by orchestrating a p27(Kip1)-dependent G1/S phase arrest in conjunction with activating NF-kappaB. Thus, we achieved a much better understanding of the penetrance and mechanistic complexity of Bcl-2 dependent anti-apoptotic pathways in cancer cells and why Bcl-2 inactivation is so critical for the efficacy of apoptosis and anti-proliferative inducing drugs like 2-ME2.","['Batsi, Christina', 'Markopoulou, Soultana', 'Kontargiris, Evangelos', 'Charalambous, Christiana', 'Thomas, Christoforos', 'Christoforidis, Savvas', 'Kanavaros, Panagiotis', 'Constantinou, Andreas I', 'Marcu, Kenneth B', 'Kolettas, Evangelos']","['Batsi C', 'Markopoulou S', 'Kontargiris E', 'Charalambous C', 'Thomas C', 'Christoforidis S', 'Kanavaros P', 'Constantinou AI', 'Marcu KB', 'Kolettas E']","['Cell and Molecular Physiology Unit, Laboratory of Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM066882/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM066882-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090327,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'S Phase/drug effects/*physiology']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00192-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jul 1;78(1):33-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.017.

The patient, a 42-year-old man who developed acute leukemia 38 months after liver transplantation, was successfully treated with chemotherapy and has subsequently been in remission. With appropriate adjustment of immunosuppressive agents, he was able to safely benefit from chemotherapy. Only 16 patients with acute leukemia after liver transplantation have been reported, and the mortality rate is extraordinarily high (52.94%, 9/17). More cases of acute leukemia will emerge as the rate of survival after liver transplantation increases. The patient's chromosomal mutation profile, the choice of immunosuppressive agent, and infection by hepatitis virus may be the risk factors for the development of acute leukemia after LT.

Although there is some degree of overlap in chemokine receptor-mediated pathway activation, different chemokines will often elicit distinct signaling events. Factors such as cell type, receptor expression levels, G protein availability, and disease state will also influence the signaling response from chemokine-induced receptor activation. Improvements in mass spectrometry, enrichment strategies, and database search programs for identifying phosphopeptides have made phosphoproteomics an accessible biological tool for studying chemokine-induced phosphorylation cascades. Although signaling pathways involved in chemokine-mediated migration have been fairly well characterized, less is known regarding other signaling cascades elicited by chemokines (e.g. to induce proliferation) or the potential for distinct pathway activation in a disease state such as cancer. CXCL12(SDF-1)/CXCR4 signaling has been shown to play an important role in the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and thus provides a good system for exploring chemokine signaling, particularly in the interest of survival pathway activation. In this chapter, we describe the use of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) phosphopeptide enrichment followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for exploring CXCL12-mediated signaling in human CLL patient cells.","[""O'Hayre, Morgan"", 'Salanga, Catherina L', 'Dorrestein, Pieter C', 'Handel, Tracy M']","[""O'Hayre M"", 'Salanga CL', 'Dorrestein PC', 'Handel TM']","['Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI037113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F31/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01-AI37113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Methods Enzymol,Methods in enzymology,0212271,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0076-6879(09)05216-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0076-6879(09)05216-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Enzymol. 2009;460:331-46. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(09)05216-1.,10.1016/S0076-6879(09)05216-1 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of trigger mechanisms in liposomes could be relevant for drugs susceptible to lysosomal hydrolytic/enzymatic degradation. Here, we propose a polymeric pH-sensitive liposome system that is designed to release its content inside the endosomes through a polymer structural change following receptor-mediated internalization. Specifically, pH-sensitive immunoliposomes (ILs) were obtained by including a terminally alkylated copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) in the liposome bilayer and by coupling the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody to target leukemic cells. In vitro release of encapsulated fluorescent probes and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) revealed that pH-sensitivity of the vector was retained in the presence of the antibody upon incubation in plasma. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses demonstrated that the pH-sensitive ILs were efficiently internalized by various CD33+ leukemic cell lines while limited interaction was found for liposomes decorated with an isotype-matched control antibody. Finally, the pH-sensitive ILs-CD33 formulation exhibited the highest cytotoxicity against HL60 cells, confirming the role of the NIPAM copolymer in promoting the escape of intact ara-C in the endosomes. These results suggest that this pH-sensitive liposomal formulation could be beneficial in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Simard, Pierre', 'Leroux, Jean-Christophe']","['Simard P', 'Leroux JC']","['Canada Research Chair in Drug Delivery, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, P.C. 6128 Downtown Station, Montreal (Qc), Canada H3C 3J7.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090514,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Acrylic Resins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Polymethacrylic Acids)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '151954-97-1 (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid))']",IM,"['Acrylamides/chemistry', 'Acrylic Resins/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Alkylation', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*chemistry/immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cold Temperature', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Stability', 'Endocytosis', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage/*chemistry/immunology', 'Polymethacrylic Acids/chemistry', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2009/05/19 09:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2008/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(09)00291-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2009 Nov 3;381(2):86-96. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.05.013.

PRTN3 also has been shown to elicit both antibody responses and T-cell proliferation in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. In order to improve current vaccines that aim to stimulate CTL without inducing harmful autoimmune disease, it is necessary to study the role of PRTN3-specific CD4+ T-helper (TH) and CD4+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells. Since both TH and Treg cells recognize antigens in the context of HLA-class-II-molecules, identification of HLA-class-II-associated peptide-epitopes from self-antigens such as PRTN3 is required. Here, we analyzed T-cell responses against proteinase 3 using synthetic peptides predicted to serve as HLA-DR-restricted epitopes. We first screened a panel of ten epitope peptide candidates selected with the TEPITOPE program and found that nine out of ten peptides induced PRTN3 peptide-specific proliferation of T-cells with precursor frequencies of 0-1.1 x 10(-6). For one peptide-epitope, PRTN3(235), T-cell-clones were demonstrated to be capable of recognizing naturally processed protein antigen in a HLA-DR-restricted fashion. PRTN3(235)-specific T-cells could be stimulated from the blood of healthy individuals with multiple HLA-DR-genotypes. In summary, the identified PRTN3(235)-epitope can be used to study the role of CD4+ TH- and Treg-cells in immune responses against PRTN3 in leukemia patients and patients with Wegener's disease.","['Piesche, Matthias', 'Hildebrandt, York', 'Chapuy, Bjorn', 'Wulf, Gerald G', 'Trumper, Lorenz', 'Schroers, Roland']","['Piesche M', 'Hildebrandt Y', 'Chapuy B', 'Wulf GG', 'Trumper L', 'Schroers R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090527,Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Myeloblastin/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/09/01 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0264-410X(09)00678-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2009 Jul 23;27(34):4718-23. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.010.

TOF and ethyl acetate extracts were found to be efficient in inhibiting xanthine oxidase with IC(50) values of 240 and 185 microg/ml and superoxide anion with IC(50) values of 150 and 215 microg/ml, respectively. Also, all the extracts tested were effective in reducing the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and were able to protect against H(2)O(2)/UV-photolysis induced DNA damage. The highest activity, measured as equivalents of MDA concentration, was observed in the ethyl acetate extract (MDA=2.04 nM). In addition, the data suggest that only TOF enriched extract exerts growth inhibition on K562 cells through apoptosis induction. Therefore, these extracts were subjected to further separation by chromatographic methods. Thus, three major compounds (catechin, afzelechin and galloyl quinic acid) were isolated from the TOF enriched extract and five major compounds (luteolin, ferulic acid, quercetin, 3-hydroxy, 4-methoxy-benzoic acid and 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) from ethyl acetate extract. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic data analysis and comparison with the literature. In addition, we evaluate the biological activities of the catechin, ferulic acid and luteolin. This investigation has revealed that the luteolin was the most active in reducing the production of TBARS (MDA=1.5 nM), inhibiting significantly the proliferation of K562 cells (IC(50)=25 microg/ml) and protecting against H(2)O(2)/UV-photolysis induced DNA damage. In conclusion, the study reveals that the ability of C. rotundus to inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO), the lipid peroxidation and to exert apoptotic effect, may explain possible mechanisms by which C. rotundus exhibits its health benefits.","['Kilani-Jaziri, Soumaya', 'Neffati, Aicha', 'Limem, Ilef', 'Boubaker, Jihed', 'Skandrani, Ines', 'Sghair, Mohamed Ben', 'Bouhlel, Ines', 'Bhouri, Wissem', 'Mariotte, Anne Marie', 'Ghedira, Kamel', 'Dijoux Franca, Marie-Genvieve', 'Chekir-Ghedira, Leila']","['Kilani-Jaziri S', 'Neffati A', 'Limem I', 'Boubaker J', 'Skandrani I', 'Sghair MB', 'Bouhlel I', 'Bhouri W', 'Mariotte AM', 'Ghedira K', 'Dijoux Franca MG', 'Chekir-Ghedira L']","['Unite de Pharmacognosie/Biologie Moleculaire 99/UR/07-03, Faculte de Pharmacie, Rue Avicenne, Monastir, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090514,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyperus/*chemistry', 'DNA Damage', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00180-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2009 Sep 14;181(1):85-94. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.04.014.

Mast cells are often increased in the bone marrow of patients with primary bone marrow disorders, and patients with systemic mastocytosis often have a second concomitant neoplastic disease of the bone marrow. The goals of the current study were to determine the role the mast cell has in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and to correlate the mast cell burden with the degree of reticulin fibrosis. We used computer-assisted image analysis of bone marrow core biopsies stained for mast cell tryptase from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms [31 cases: 12 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 6 primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 4 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 4 polycythemia vera (PV), and 5 chronic myeloproliferative disorder, unclassifiable (CMPD-U)]. Although the number of cases of some subtypes of MPN was small, the results suggested that PMF and ET each had significantly more mast cells than both CML and control cases (P<0.01 and 0.05, respectively, Mann-Whitney test). CMPD-U and PV showed no significant differences from the control cases, but the CML cases had significantly fewer mast cells than our control cases (P=0.02, Mann-Whitney test). In addition, the quantity of mast cells seen in the bone marrows of MPN patients correlated with reticulin fibrosis (P=0.04, Mann-Whitney test). Our studies highlight the different mast cell quantities in different myeloproliferative neoplasms and suggest a direct role for the mast cell in intramedullary fibrosis. Further studies are warranted to confirm our observation and to study the mechanisms by which mast cells contribute to fibrosis in the MPN setting.","['Ahmed, Arsalan', 'Powers, Martin P', 'Youker, Keith A', 'Rice, Lawrence', 'Ewton, April', 'Dunphy, Cherie H', 'Chang, Chung-Che']","['Ahmed A', 'Powers MP', 'Youker KA', 'Rice L', 'Ewton A', 'Dunphy CH', 'Chang CC']","['The Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090514,Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,['0 (Reticulin)'],IM,"['Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*immunology/*pathology', 'Reticulin/*metabolism']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2008/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0344-0338(09)00106-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.prp.2009.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 2009;205(9):634-8. doi: 10.1016/j.prp.2009.04.003.

However, glucocorticoid resistance is a therapeutic problem with an unclear molecular mechanism. 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11beta-HSD1) is expressed in glucocorticoid target tissue, where it regenerates active glucocorticoids from inert 11keto-glucocorticoids, amplifying intracellular glucocorticoid levels. Here, we show 11beta-HSD1 expression in leukemic cells from ALL patients (n=14). 11beta-HSD1 was differentially regulated by glucocorticoids between glucocorticoid-sensitive and -resistant ALL cells. Dexamethasone increased 11beta-HSD1 mRNA levels in glucocorticoid-sensitive ALL cells, but decreased levels in the resistant group.

Graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) is the major risk factor of DLT. In dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical littermate dogs, DLT given within 3 weeks after transplantation of marrow depleted of T cells using absorbed antithymocyte globulin produced fatal GVHD, whereas at 2 months or later after transplantation, DLT were tolerated without GVHD. Here, we studied tolerance to DLT in DLA-haploidentical recipients of CD6-depleted bone marrow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow recipients were DLA-heterozygous and DLA-haploidentical to their DLA-homozygous donors. Marrow transplantation was performed on day 0, one day after total body irradiation with 10Gy. CD6 depletion was achieved by treatment of the marrow with CD6 antibody and rabbit complement. Natural killer cell activity of CD6-depleted cells was studied against canine thyroid adenocarcinoma cells. DLT were given at various time points after transplantation. RESULTS: Seven DLA-heterozygous dogs given undepleted marrow died of GVHD within 28 days. In contrast, three dogs given CD6-depleted marrow had sustained engraftment without occurrence of GVHD. DLT given on either day 3, 7, or 14 produced fatal GVHD. DLT on day 20, however, produced fatal GVHD in only two of four dogs. Mixed chimerism was converted into complete chimerism in all cases. Contrary to T-cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin, CD6 depletion spares canine natural killer cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that T-cell depletion with CD6 antibody and complement induces graft-vs-host tolerance without jeopardizing engraftment. DLT on days 3, 7, and 14 after transplantation produced GVHD, but it failed to abrogate tolerance in two of four dogs transfused on day 20.","['Zorn, Julia', 'Herber, Martin', 'Schwamberger, Sabine', 'Panzer, Werner', 'Adler, Heiko', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem']","['Zorn J', 'Herber M', 'Schwamberger S', 'Panzer W', 'Adler H', 'Kolb HJ']","['Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, National Research Center for Environmental Health, Institute of Molecular Immunology, Clinical Cooperation Group Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090513,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD6 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (histocompatibility antigen DLA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', '*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dogs', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00157-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2009 Aug;37(8):998-1006. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.05.001.

Here we demonstrate that high levels are expressed by normal human T and B lymphocytes from tonsils and peripheral blood in relation to their activation status, as CTR(+) T cells are prone to produce IFN-gamma after TCR stimulation. The receptor is also highly expressed on B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, thus suggesting a correlation between its expression, their proliferative extent as well as their memory, antigen-experienced phenotype. Moreover, we found that binding of the receptor with salmon calcitonin induces an increase of intracellular calcium(2+) in peripheral lymphocytes. This effect is involved in several lymphocyte immune functions, as cytosolic calcium(2+) levels regulate both cell proliferation and cytokine production. In our hands, the increase of calcium(2+) levels by CTR binding with sCT induced a dose-dependent cell proliferation. We therefore suppose that expression of this functional receptor may contribute to the modulation of cytoplasmic calcium(2+) levels needed to regulate T and B cell activation and perhaps other immune functions.","['Cafforio, Paola', 'De Matteo, Monica', 'Brunetti, Anna Elisabetta', 'Dammacco, Franco', 'Silvestris, Franco']","['Cafforio P', 'De Matteo M', 'Brunetti AE', 'Dammacco F', 'Silvestris F']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Oncology, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090513,United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitonin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Palatine Tonsil/pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitonin/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Salmon', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",2009/05/19 09:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0198-8859(09)00134-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humimm.2009.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2009 Sep;70(9):678-85. doi: 10.1016/j.humimm.2009.05.005.

Results obtained show that selected purified compounds had a cytotoxic effect on the human leukaemia cell line K562, inhibited both TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB-DNA binding as well as TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation and nuclear translocation of p50/p65. Furthermore, we observed the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation induced by an overexpression of IKKbeta. Interestingly, natural products inhibited IKKbeta kinase as well as the 26S proteasome proteolytic activity.","['Folmer, Florence', 'Jaspars, Marcel', 'Solano, Godofredo', 'Cristofanon, Silvia', 'Henry, Estelle', 'Tabudravu, Jioji', 'Black, Kenny', 'Green, David H', 'Kupper, Frithjof C', 'Aalbersberg, William', 'Feussner, Klaus', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Folmer F', 'Jaspars M', 'Solano G', 'Cristofanon S', 'Henry E', 'Tabudravu J', 'Black K', 'Green DH', 'Kupper FC', 'Aalbersberg W', 'Feussner K', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Aberdeen, Old Aberdeen, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090513,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Biological Products/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/chemistry', '*Marine Biology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00377-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Sep 15;78(6):592-606. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.05.009.

Recently, we have established the MLL-SEPT2 gene fusion as the molecular abnormality subjacent to the translocation t(2;11)(q37;q23) in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. In this work we quantified MLL and SEPT2 gene expression in 58 acute myeloid leukemia patients selected to represent the major AML genetic subgroups, as well as in all three cases of MLL-SEPT2-associated myeloid neoplasms so far described in the literature. METHODS: Cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular studies (RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and qMSP) were used to characterize 58 acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML) at diagnosis selected to represent the major AML genetic subgroups: CBFB-MYH11 (n = 13), PML-RARA (n = 12); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n = 12), normal karyotype (n = 11), and MLL gene fusions other than MLL-SEPT2 (n = 10). We also studied all three MLL-SEPT2 myeloid neoplasia cases reported in the literature, namely two AML patients and a t-MDS patient. RESULTS: When compared with normal controls, we found a 12.8-fold reduction of wild-type SEPT2 and MLL-SEPT2 combined expression in cases with the MLL-SEPT2 gene fusion (p = 0.007), which is accompanied by a 12.4-fold down-regulation of wild-type MLL and MLL-SEPT2 combined expression (p = 0.028). The down-regulation of SEPT2 in MLL-SEPT2 myeloid neoplasias was statistically significant when compared with all other leukemia genetic subgroups (including those with other MLL gene fusions). In addition, MLL expression was also down-regulated in the group of MLL fusions other than MLL-SEPT2, when compared with the normal control group (p = 0.023) CONCLUSION: We found a significant down-regulation of both SEPT2 and MLL in MLL-SEPT2 myeloid neoplasias. In addition, we also found that MLL is under-expressed in AML patients with MLL fusions other than MLL-SEPT2.","['Cerveira, Nuno', 'Santos, Joana', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Costa, Vera', 'Ribeiro, Franclim R', 'Lisboa, Susana', 'Correia, Cecilia', 'Torres, Lurdes', 'Vieira, Joana', 'Snijder, Simone', 'Mariz, Jose M', 'Norton, Lucilia', 'Mellink, Clemens H', 'Buijs, Arjan', 'Teixeira, Manuel R']","['Cerveira N', 'Santos J', 'Bizarro S', 'Costa V', 'Ribeiro FR', 'Lisboa S', 'Correia C', 'Torres L', 'Vieira J', 'Snijder S', 'Mariz JM', 'Norton L', 'Mellink CH', 'Buijs A', 'Teixeira MR']","['Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal. nscerveira@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090515,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/19 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/19 09:00'],"['2008/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-147 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-147 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 May 15;9:147. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-147.,10.1186/1471-2407-9-147 [doi],PMC2689242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Various models such as scavenging superoxide anions and 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, as well as protecting of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were employed to assay the antioxidative effects of the diarylheptanoids. The cytotoxicities of compounds 1-5 were measured with MTT assays. RESULT: The test compounds (1-5) showed promising DPPH inhibitory activities, and compound 5 exhibited the strongest DPPH scavenging activity with an IC50 value of (22.6+/-2.4) micromol x L(-1). Compounds 1, 3 and 4 showed potential anti-peroxidative effects with inhibitory rates of (66.3+/-15.4)%, (68.7+/-15.8)% and (72.2+/-10.6)%, respectively, at 100 microg x mL(-1).

Gain of Notch1 function results in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a number of mouse experimental models, and activating Notch1 mutations deregulate Notch1 signaling in the majority of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Notch2, another member of the Notch gene family, is preferentially expressed in mature B cells and is essential for marginal zone B-cell generation. Here, we report that 5 of 63 (approximately 8%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, a subtype of mature B-cell lymphomas, have Notch2 mutations. These mutations lead to partial or complete deletion of the proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich (PEST) domain, or a single amino acid substitution at the C-terminus of Notch2 protein. Furthermore, high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that some diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases also have increased copies of the mutated Notch2 allele. In the Notch activation-sensitive luciferase reporter assay in vitro, mutant Notch2 receptors show increased activity compared with wild-type Notch2. These findings implicate Notch2 gain-of-function mutations in the pathogenesis of a subset of B-cell lymphomas, and suggest broader roles for Notch gene mutations in human cancers.","['Lee, Suk-young', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Nakazaki, Kumi', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Matsumoto, Akihiko', 'Yamamoto, Go', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Ota, Satoshi', 'Ota, Yasunori', 'Izutsu, Koji', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Hangaishi, Akira', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Fukayama, Masashi', 'Seto, Masao', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Lee SY', 'Kumano K', 'Nakazaki K', 'Sanada M', 'Matsumoto A', 'Yamamoto G', 'Nannya Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Ota S', 'Ota Y', 'Izutsu K', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Hangaishi A', 'Yagita H', 'Fukayama M', 'Seto M', 'Kurokawa M', 'Ogawa S', 'Chiba S']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neprilysin/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Receptor, Notch2/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01130.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 May;100(5):920-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01130.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two point mutants of PLZF that have lost the antioncogenic activity of the wild-type protein are oncogenic in chicken embryo fibroblasts; this activity is correlated with differential effects on Myc. Wild-type PLZF represses Myc transcription without affecting total Myc protein levels and reduces the levels of phosphorylated Myc. The PLZF mutants do not alter Myc transcription or protein expression but increase the levels of phosphorylated Myc. These modifications of Myc are correlated with PLZF-induced changes in Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Wild-type PLZF downregulates the MAPK pathway and activates Akt, resulting in reduced phosphorylation on serine 62 of Myc by Erk and on threonine 58 by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. The mutants fail to activate Akt and only slightly downregulate phospho-Erk. We postulate that the 2 PLZF mutants are oncogenic, because they function as dominant negatives of wild-type PLZF, enhancing Myc phosphorylation and increasing Myc transcriptional and oncogenic activity. In support of this suggestion, a specific inhibitor of Myc is able to revert the transformed phenotype of PLZF mutant-expressing cells.","['Shi, Jin', 'Vogt, Peter K']","['Shi J', 'Vogt PK']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA078230-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24449 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Oct 1;125(7):1558-65. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24449.,10.1002/ijc.24449 [doi],PMC2721905,['NIHMS115924'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-ALL origin has been a subject of continuing discussion, given the fact that human disease is diagnosed at late stages and cannot be monitored during its natural evolution from its cell of origin, although most B-ALLs probably start off with chromosomal changes in haematopoietic stem cells. However, the cells responsible for maintaining the disease appear to differ between the different types of B-ALLs and this remains an intriguing and exciting topic of research, since these cells have been posited to be responsible for resistance to conventional therapies, recurrence and dissemination. During the last years this problem has been addressed primarily by transplantation of purified subpopulations of human B-ALL cells into immunodeficient mice.

However, its molecular mechanisms of action are poorly understood. In the present study, we used the human leukemia (HL-60) cell line as a test model to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer properties of As(2)O(3). We hypothesized that As(2)O(3)-induced expression of stress genes and related proteins may play a role in the cellular and molecular events leading to cell cycle modulation in leukemic cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed Western blot analysis to assess the expression of specific cellular response proteins including p53, c-fos, RARE, Cyclin A, and Cyclin D1. Densitometric analysis was performed to determine the relative abundance of these proteins. Western Blot and densitometric analyses demonstrated a strong dose-response relationship with regard to p53 and RARE expression within the dose-range of 0-8 microg/ml. Expression of c-fos was slightly up-regulated at 2 microg/ml, and down-regulated within the dose-range of 4-8 microg/ml. A statistically significant down-regulation of this protein was detected at the 6 and 8 microg/ml dose levels. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in Cyclin D1 expression was found between As(2)O(3)-treated cells and the control. Cyclin A expression in As(2)O(3)-treated HL-60 cells was up-regulated at 6 microg/ml, suggesting that it is required for S phase and passage through G(2) phase in cell cycle progression. Taken together, these results indicate that As(2)O(3) has the potential to induce cell cycle arrest through activation of the 53-kDa tumor suppressor protein and repression of the c-fos transcription factor. Up-regulation of RARE by As(2)O(3) indicates that its cytotoxicity may be mediated through interaction/binding with the retinoic acid receptor, and subsequent inhibition of growth and differentiation.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH-RCMI Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18540, Jackson, MS, USA.']",['eng'],"['G12 RR013459/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR013459-12/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'G12 RR013459-125442/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '2G12RR13459-11/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090515,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin A1/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', '*Response Elements', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2009/05/16 09:00,2010/01/19 06:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-009-0160-z [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2009 Nov;331(1-2):207-14. doi: 10.1007/s11010-009-0160-z.

METHODS: MS patients completed a survey questionnaire that included a series of choice-format conjoint tradeoff tasks. Patients chose hypothetical treatments from pairs of treatment alternatives with varying levels of clinical efficacy and associated risks. RESULTS: Among the 651 patients who completed the survey, delay in years to disability progression was the most important factor in treatment preferences. In return for decreases in relapse rates from 4 to 1 and increases in delay in progression from 3 to 5 years, patients were willing to accept a 0.38% annual risk of death or disability from PML, a 0.39% annual risk of death from liver failure or a 0.48% annual risk of death from leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Medical interventions carry risks of adverse outcomes that must be evaluated against their clinical benefits. Most MS patients indicated they are willing to accept risks in exchange for clinical efficacy.

This approach, termed MIDAS (MRM-initiated detection and sequencing), is more sensitive than approaches using neutral loss scanning or precursor ion scanning methodologies, due to a more efficient use of duty cycle along with a decreased background signal associated with MRM.

This is the first spatial study of this incidence to cover a 15-year period.

The overall homogeneity of the relative risks of leukaemia was tested, as well as comparison to 1 of each relative risk by the exact Poisson test. To give a more stable estimate of the underlying relative risk pattern than that provided by the local standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), Bayesian hierarchical models using four different spatial priors have been produced: the parametric BYM and CAR models, and two semiparametric models. Very slight overall heterogeneity was observed on the whole AL data set (SIR overdispersion 18.6%, P=0.10). Irrespective of the model, the ranges of the smoothed SIRs exhibited considerable shrinkage relative to the ranges of the local SIRs. The associated maps were slightly heterogeneous; the smoothed SIRs of overall acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of the south-west departements were slightly higher than those of the north-east. The results, however, did not remain stable when investigated by leukaemia type, time period, sex or age group. No spatial heterogeneity of childhood AL incidence on the departement scale was observed but that does not exclude spatial heterogeneity on other scales.","['Faure, Claire', 'Mollie, Annie', 'Bellec, Stephanie', 'Guyot-Goubin, Aurelie', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Hemon, Denis']","['Faure C', 'Mollie A', 'Bellec S', 'Guyot-Goubin A', 'Clavel J', 'Hemon D']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Demography', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2009/05/16 09:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32832bf43a [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2009 Aug;18(4):267-79. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32832bf43a.,10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32832bf43a [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion proteins play an important role in leukemogenesis by subverting the function of one or both partner proteins. The leukemogenic CALM-AF10 fusion protein is capable of interacting with the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79)-specific methyltransferase hDOT1L through the fused AF10 moiety. This interaction leads to local H3K79 hypermethylation on Hoxa5 loci, which up-regulates the expression of Hoxa5 and contributes to leukemogenesis. However, the long latency of leukemogenesis of CALM-AF10 transgenic mice suggests that the direct effects of fusion oncogene are not sufficient for the induction of leukemia. In this study, we show that the CALM-AF10 fusion protein can also greatly reduce global H3K79 methylation in both human and murine leukemic cells by disrupting the AF10-mediated association of hDOT1L with chromatin. Cells with reduced H3K79 methylation are more sensitive to gamma-irradiation and display increased chromosomal instability. Consistently, leukemia patients harboring CALM-AF10 fusion have more secondary chromosomal aberrations.

The aim of the study was the analysis of ex vivo activity of clofarabine and 14 other anticancer drugs in pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid (AML) leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ex vivo drug resistance profile was analyzed in 282 patients, including 201 children with ALL de novo, 24 children with relapsed ALL, 25 children with AML de novo and 32 adults with AML. Cellular ex vivo drug resistance was tested by means of the MTT assay. RESULTS: Clofarabine had comparable ex vivo activity against lymphoblasts and myeloblasts, both on initial diagnosis and at relapse, both in children and in adults. Its activity in acute myeloid leukemia was independent of patient age. No significant differences in drug resistance to clofarabine between pediatric age-based subgroups of ALL were detected, while it was observed for most of other drugs. An activity of clofarabine in relapsed pediatric ALL patients was as good as in newly-diagnosed ones. CONCLUSION: In comparison to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lack of differences in ex vivo activity gives rationale for use of clofarabine in refractory and relapsed pediatric and adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Styczynski, Jan', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Derwich, Katarzyna', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Wieczorek, Maria', 'Balcerska, Anna', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, Danuta', 'Stefaniak, Jolanta', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Urasinski, Tomasz', 'Sobol, Grazyna', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Styczynski J', 'Gil L', 'Derwich K', 'Wachowiak J', 'Balwierz W', 'Badowska W', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Matysiak M', 'Wieczorek M', 'Balcerska A', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Stefaniak J', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Urasinski T', 'Sobol G', 'Komarnicki M', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, ul.

Recently, the importance of this pump in external stimuli-induced leukemia cell apoptosis has been increasingly appreciated, however, the exact role of Na,K-ATPase in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway still remains little understood. In this study, we found mitochondrial toxin rotenone caused a rapid mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse in Jurkat cells followed by plasma membrane depolarization (PMP). Similar results were also obtained in human U937 cells and non-cancerous mouse primary T cells. Rotenone-induced PMP depolarization occurred before apoptosis and well correlated with Na,K-ATPase impairment. To understand the mechanisms, Jurkat cells with mtDNA depletion and catalase overexpression were used. The results demonstrated that both PMP depolarization and Na,K-ATPase impairment induced by rotenone were regulated by mitochondrial H(2)O(2) and Bcl-2. Finally, Na,K-ATPase suppression by ouabain greatly accelerated and enhanced mitochondrial toxins-induced cells apoptosis in Jurkat, U937 and primary T cells. In sum, by using leukemia cells and mouse primary T cells, we confirmed that mitochondria-to-Na,K-ATPase and PMP depolarization might represent a novel mechanism for mitochondria to amplify death signals in the initiation stage of cells apoptosis induced by mitochondrial toxins.","['Yin, Wu', 'Li, Xiang', 'Feng, Su', 'Cheng, Wei', 'Tang, Bo', 'Shi, Yi-Lin', 'Hua, Zi-Chun']","['Yin W', 'Li X', 'Feng S', 'Cheng W', 'Tang B', 'Shi YL', 'Hua ZC']","['The State Key Lab of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Nanjing University, 22# HanKou Rd., Nanjing 210093, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090405,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*drug effects/*enzymology/pathology', 'Rotenone/toxicity', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'U937 Cells']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00252-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jul 15;78(2):191-202. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.025.

Immunosuppressive agents might be used for steroid-sparing effect. We report the case of a patient with refractory BP successfully treated with rituximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An 83-year-old woman was hospitalized in January 2005 for severe BP. She was initially treated with 30 g/day of clobetasol propionate 0.05% and methotrexate (20 mg/week), with partial remission. However, every attempt to reduce topical corticosteroids resulted in a relapse of the patient's BP. Subsequently, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, dapsone, intravenous immunoglobulins, topical tacrolimus and systemic glucocorticoids (steroid-dependency at 20 mg/day) failed to induce complete remission. In December 2005, we decided to treat the patient with four infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) at 1-week intervals, and this led to a dramatic reduction of the severity of BP. In May 2006, a second course of rituximab was given. One month later, for the first time in 18 months, complete clinical and immunological remission of BP was noted. The patient remains in complete remission, without treatment, 2 years after the last infusion of rituximab. DISCUSSION: The B cell-modulating effect of rituximab has encouraged its use in a variety of autoimmune diseases including pemphigus. Only five cases of refractory BP, treated with rituximab (including two paediatric cases), have so far been reported. In three of these cases, follow-up was too short to allow detection of any relapse and the other two patients had lymphocytic leukaemia requiring rituximab infusions every 2 months. In our case, the two courses of rituximab were well tolerated, induced complete clinical and immunological remission and enabled discontinuation of local and systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Rituximab could offer a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for refractory BP.","['Reguiai, Z', 'Tchen, T', 'Perceau, G', 'Bernard, P']","['Reguiai Z', 'Tchen T', 'Perceau G', 'Bernard P']","['Service de dermatologie, hopital Robert-Debre, CHU de Reims, 51092 Reims cedex, France. zreguiai@chu-reims.fr']",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090226,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Pemphigoid, Bullous/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(09)00040-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2008.10.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2009 May;136(5):431-4. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2008.10.038.

We report the cases of two patients who developed a peculiar toxic rash suggestive of Sweet's syndrome while receiving bortezomib; one patient also presented giant mucous membrane ulcerations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case 1: bortezomib treatment was started in a 62-year-old man for mantle cell lymphoma. Ten days after the first treatment cycle, giant, painful oral ulcerations were noted but they resolved spontaneously. One week after the second cycle, further oral ulceration appeared, this time with a papulonodular skin rash. Histology showed neutrophilic dermal infiltrates in the skin with predominantly lymphocytic inflammation of the oral mucosa. Bortezomib was stopped and all lesions resolved with colchicine treatment. Case 2: a 46-year-old woman was receiving bortezomib treatment for plasma cell leukemia. A febrile skin rash appeared two days after the first treatment cycle but resolved spontaneously. After the first bortezomib injection during the next cycle, painful papules and nodules appeared on the trunk. The skin biopsy results were consistent with Sweet's syndrome. The lesions disappeared spontaneously. Dexamethasone was administered concomitantly with bortezomib in the ensuing cycles and there was no relapse of the skin lesions. DISCUSSION: Bortezomib-induced skin lesions are common and usually do not justify treatment withdrawal. Published observations of bortezomib-induced eruption occasionally show clinical and histological features of Sweet's syndrome, but there has been no mention of oral mucosal ulcerations. In our cases, these could be related to bortezomib-induced neutrophilic dermatosis.","['Thuillier, D', 'Lenglet, A', 'Chaby, G', 'Royer, R', 'Vaida, I', 'Viseux, V', 'Dadban, A', 'Billet, A', 'Christophe, O', 'Chatelain, D', 'Marolleau, J-P', 'Lok, C', 'Damaj, G']","['Thuillier D', 'Lenglet A', 'Chaby G', 'Royer R', 'Vaida I', 'Viseux V', 'Dadban A', 'Billet A', 'Christophe O', 'Chatelain D', 'Marolleau JP', 'Lok C', 'Damaj G']","[""Service de dermatologie, hopital Sud, CHU d'Amiens, 80054 Amiens cedex 1, France.""]",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090227,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Biopsy', 'Boronic Acids/*adverse effects', 'Bortezomib', 'Colchicine/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/*adverse effects', 'Skin Ulcer/chemically induced/pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/*chemically induced/drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(09)00037-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2008.10.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2009 May;136(5):427-30. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2008.10.039.

In spite of the prevalent application of microarray experiments for profiling gene expression in cancer samples, they provide limited information regarding the activities of transcription factors. However, the association between transcription factors and cancers is largely dependent on the transcription regulatory activities rather than mRNA expression levels. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a computational approach that integrates microarray expression data with the transcription factor binding site information to systematically identify transcription factors associated with patient survival given a specific cancer type. This approach was applied to two gene expression data sets for breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. We found that two transcription factor families, the steroid nuclear receptor family and the ATF/CREB family, are significantly correlated with the survival of patients with breast cancer; and that a transcription factor named T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 is significantly correlated with acute myeloid leukemia patient survival. CONCLUSION: Our analysis identifies transcription factors associating with patient survival and provides insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying the breast cancer and leukemia. The transcription factors identified by our method are biologically meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge. As an insightful tool, this approach can also be applied to other microarray cancer data sets to help researchers better understand the intricate relationship between transcription factors and diseases.","['Cheng, Chao', 'Li, Lei M', 'Alves, Pedro', 'Gerstein, Mark']","['Cheng C', 'Li LM', 'Alves P', 'Gerstein M']","['Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. chao.cheng@yale.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090515,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2008/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-10-225 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-10-225 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2009 May 15;10:225. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-10-225.,10.1186/1471-2164-10-225 [doi],PMC2686740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus the presence of sequence variants in genes involved in these pathways that modulate their activity might have an impact on cancer risk. Many molecular epidemiological studies have investigated the association between sequence variants, particularly SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), and cancer risk. For instance, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) SNPs have been associated with increased risk of breast, prostate, leukaemia, colon and early-onset lung cancer, and the intron 3 16-bp repeat in TP53 (tumour protein 53) is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. In contrast, the variant allele of the rare CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2 checkpoint homologue) missense variant (accession number rs17879961) was significantly associated with a lower incidence of lung and upper aerodigestive cancers. For some sequence variants, a strong gene-environment interaction has also been noted. For instance, a greater absolute risk reduction of lung and upper aerodigestive cancers in smokers than in non-smokers carrying the I157T CHEK2 variant has been observed, as has an interaction between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures on lung cancer risk. The challenge now is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.","['Hall, Janet', 'Marcel, Virginie', 'Bolin, Celeste', 'Fernet, Marie', 'Tartier, Laurence', 'Vaslin, Laurence', 'Hainaut, Pierre']","['Hall J', 'Marcel V', 'Bolin C', 'Fernet M', 'Tartier L', 'Vaslin L', 'Hainaut P']","['Institut Curie-Recherche, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France. janet.hall@curie.u-psud.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BST0370527 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0370527 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2009 Jun;37(Pt 3):527-33. doi: 10.1042/BST0370527.,10.1042/BST0370527 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These conditions are characterized by increased blood count, marrow hyperplasia and extramedulary hemopoiesis. Vascular events might complicate their course, and transformation to either acute leukemia or myelofibrosis can finally occur. Among cMPDs, Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) belong to the group of Ph-negative cMPDs. Although they share common pathogenetic features, these entities have a quite different prognosis. The common pathogenetic basis of Ph-negative cMPDs was recognized long ago, and it was suggested that a stimulating factor might enhance bone marrow hemopoietic activity. Hemopoietic progenitors from cMPDs show hypersensitivity to low levels of a variety of hemopoietic cytokines. The independency of erythroid precursors from erythropoietin became the first surrogate marker of an abnormal hemopoietic clone. This clone is characterized by increased proliferation and survival, as well as by decreased apoptosis, leading to the accumulation of mature blood cells that additionally show a phenotype of activated cells. Recently four independent groups have described an activating point mutation in the JAK2 kinase as a key pathogenetic event in Ph-negative cMPDs. JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase that acts as a second intracellular messenger for many hemopoietic cytokine receptors. It is now believed that jacking up hemopoiesis can explain many features of myeloproliferation. Interestingly, some features are associated with intracellular levels of mutated JAK2 (the ""dosage hypothesis""). The mutation in JAK2 kinase is not an example of a genetic defect leading to a single disease, since it occurs in many other myeloid disorders, and probably represents a secondary hit in a multistep ongogenetic process. Nevertheless, it has changed the way we approach cMPD patients and has clarified many aspects of their biology.","['Spanoudakis, Emmanouil', 'Tsatalas, Costas']","['Spanoudakis E', 'Tsatalas C']","['Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Area of Dragana, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/157488809788167445 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2009 May;4(2):154-60. doi: 10.2174/157488809788167445.,,,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their presence in the tumor may herald malignancy potential, mediate resistance to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and confer poor survival outcomes. Thus, CSC may serve as critical cellular targets for treatment. The ability to therapeutically target CSC hinges upon identifying their unique cell surface markers and the underlying survival signaling pathways. While accumulating evidence suggests cell-surface antigens (such as CD44, CD133) as CSC markers for several tumor tissues, emerging clinical needs exist for the identification of new markers to completely separate CSC from normal stem cells. Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of the tumor suppressor PTEN/PI3 kinase pathway in regulating TIC in leukemia, brain, and intestinal tissues. The successful eradication of tumors by therapies targeting CSC will require an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing CSC self renewal, differentiation, and escape from conventional therapy. Here we review recent progress from brain tumor and intestinal stem cell research with a focus on the PTEN-Akt-Wnt pathway, and how the components of CSC pathways may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics.","['Tu, Lan Chun', 'Foltz, Greg', 'Lin, Edward', 'Hood, Leroy', 'Tian, Qiang']","['Tu LC', 'Foltz G', 'Lin E', 'Hood L', 'Tian Q']","['Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA 98103, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM076547-05S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA119347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DA021519/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/157488809788167373 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2009 May;4(2):147-53. doi: 10.2174/157488809788167373.,,PMC3034385,['NIHMS258783'],79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, artificial, ES cells represent a formidable model to investigate fundamental aspects of cell stemness and early embryo development. ES cells are indeed the only stem cell type able to indefinite self-renewal and to differentiate into cellular derivates of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Recent extensive studies have revealed that ES cells maintain self-renewal and pluripotency because of a self-organizing network of transcription factors and intracellular pathways activated by extracellular signalling that together prevent their differentiation and promote their proliferation, and because of epigenetic processes that maintain the chromatin in a plastic differentiation status. Primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of gametes, because of their unique ability to retain true developmental totipotency, are considered the mother of all stem cells. Despite several similarities with ES cells, they display only transient self-renewal capability and distinct lineage-specific characteristics. In fact, in normal condition PGCs are believed to differentiate into germ cells only, oogonia/oocytes in the female, and prospermatogonia in the male which ultimately produce eggs and sperm, respectively. It is not until the fertilization of the egg or parthenogenesis that the intrinsic germ cell totipotency program is revealed. Many aspects of the extrinsic factors and signalling required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency have been identified and dissected. On the other hand, several extrinsic factors controlling PGC development have been identified, but the underlying molecular signalling remains little defined. In the present review, by comparing the available information about signalling elicited by four growth factors such as leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and kit ligand (KL) in mouse ES cells and PGCs, on which most of such studies have been performed, we aimed to give clues for the molecular understanding of the similarities and differences between these two unique cell types and to explain how apparent contradictory properties such as lineage-specific characteristics and pluripotency may coexist within PGCs. The first two growth factors have been demonstrated to control key aspects of the self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells. BMP4 and KL are known for their crucial role in regulating various process of PGC development in the embryo from the formation of PGC precursors and PGC specification (BMP4) to their survival, proliferation and migration (KL). Moreover, the combined action of LIF, FGF2 and KL is necessary and sufficient for PGC transformation into ES-like cells termed embryonic germ (EG) cells.","['De Felici, Massimo', 'Farini, Donatella', 'Dolci, Susanna']","['De Felici M', 'Farini D', 'Dolci S']","['Department of Public Health and Cell Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Italy. defelici@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/16 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/05/16 09:00'],"['2009/05/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/157488809788167391 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2009 May;4(2):87-97. doi: 10.2174/157488809788167391.,,,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of GNEE electrodes for both electric current decoupling and signal sensing in the proposed CE-EC chip not only enhances the signal response but also decreases the background noise during detection. Results show that a good detection limit of 100 nM for detecting mercaptopurine is achieved with the proposed method. In addition, the measured results also shows a good linear response between the detected CE-EC signals and the concentration of MP within the range of 100 nM-10 mM (R2 = 0.989).

Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was used to prepare the prodrug inclusion complexes, allowing it to be solubilized in water and hence to be used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. A molar ratio of the cyclodextrin: prodrug of 3 was sufficient to obtain complete solubilization of the prodrug. The inclusion complex was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, which revealed the disappearance of the melting peak of the prodrug suggesting the formation of inclusion complex. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy provided a definitive proof of the inclusion complex formation, which was evidenced by the large chemical shift displacements observed for protons located in the interior of the hydrophobic cyclodextrin cavity. The complex retained its cytotoxic activity as shown by in vitro cell survival assays on murine leukemia cells.

Two epigenetic events involved in the pathogenesis of cancer are hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor gene promoters associated with transcriptional repression and hypomethylation associated with gene reexpression and genomic instability.

We observed hypermethylation of ER alpha in 50% of the cell lines, MGMT (50%), RAR beta 2 (44%), RIL (88%), RASSF1A (69%), PAX7 (31%), PGR beta (56%), PAX2 (38%), NKX2-3 (63%), OLIG2 (63%), HAND1 (63%), ECAD (88%), CDH13 (44%), MLH1 (0%), and p16 (6%). In human melanoma cell lines, hypomethylation of MAGEA1 (44%), maspin (25%), LINE-1 (75%), and Alu (13%) is frequently observed. We analyzed a panel of cell lines for BRAF V600E and NRAS codon 61 mutations. In melanoma cell lines, the BRAF and NRAS mutations had no association with aberrant methylation. We found that the cumulative aberrant hypermethylation of the gene promoters was correlated with the level of global DNA methylation.

METHODS: A total of 188 patients with CBF AML were analyzed. The frequency of secondary CBF AML was 9%. RESULTS: Patients with secondary CBF AML were found to have significantly worse overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) compared with patients with de novo CBF AML. Secondary CBF AML status appeared to have only marginal significance in multivariate analysis.

Hsp90 has been predicted to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development; however, its role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains elusive. Using chemically distinctive Hsp90 inhibitors, we show that Hsp90 capacitates the aberrant expression and activity of crucial hepatocarcinogenesis-driving factors (e.g., insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, protein kinase B, v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4). In vitro, Hsp90 inhibition with both geldanamycin analogs (17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG)) and the non-quinone compound 8-(6-iodobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ylthio)-9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-9H-purin-6-am ine (PU-H71) reduced the viability of various HCC cell lines, induced the simultaneous degradation of numerous hepatocarcinogenic factors, and caused substantial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In contrast, nontumorigenic hepatocytes were less susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition. Because conventional geldanamycin-derivate Hsp90 inhibitors induce dose-limiting liver toxicity, we tested whether novel Hsp90 inhibitors lacking the benzoquinone moiety, which has been deemed responsible for hepatotoxicity, can elicit antineoplastic activity without causing significant liver damage. In HCC xenograft mouse models, PU-H71 was retained in tumors at pharmacologically relevant concentrations while being rapidly cleared from nontumorous liver. PU-H71 showed potent and prolonged in vivo Hsp90 inhibitory activity and reduced tumor growth without causing toxicity. CONCLUSION: Hsp90 constitutes a promising therapeutic target in HCC. Non-quinone Hsp90 inhibitors exhibit tumor-specific accumulation and exert potent antineoplastic activity without causing significant hepatotoxicity.","['Breinig, Marco', 'Caldas-Lopes, Eloisi', 'Goeppert, Benjamin', 'Malz, Mona', 'Rieker, Ralf', 'Bergmann, Frank', 'Schirmacher, Peter', 'Mayer, Matthias', 'Chiosis, Gabriela', 'Kern, Michael Andre']","['Breinig M', 'Caldas-Lopes E', 'Goeppert B', 'Malz M', 'Rieker R', 'Bergmann F', 'Schirmacher P', 'Mayer M', 'Chiosis G', 'Kern MA']","['Department of General Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Quinones', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.22912 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2009 Jul;50(1):102-12. doi: 10.1002/hep.22912.,10.1002/hep.22912 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that C21 stimulates red cell formation in anemic mice in vivo. In vitro experiments indicated that the peptide-mediated increase of erythroid colony formation in cultures of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was possible only under continuous presence of erythropoietin. In the absence of this cytokine, C21 stimulated exclusively myeloid colony formation. Therefore, the peptide is not a specific erythroid differentiation factor. In fact, it is mitogenic in non-erythroid cells, such as skin fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells. In erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, it actually decreased the production of the erythroid differentiation marker glycophorin A. C21-affinity chromatography revealed regulator of differentiation 1 (ROD1) as a major C21-binding protein. ROD1 is the hematopoietic cell paralog of polypyrimidine tract binding proteins (PTBs), RNA splice regulators which regulate differentiation by repressing tissue-specific exons. ROD1 binding to C21 was strongly inhibited by synthetic RNAs in the order poly A > poly U > poly G = poly C and was weakly inhibited by a synthetic phosphorylated peptide mimicking the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Cellular overexpression or knockdown experiments of ROD1 suggest a role for this protein in the mitogenic activity of C21. Since the nuclear proteins ROD1 and PTBs regulate differentiation at a posttranscriptional level and there is a fast nuclear uptake of C21, we put forward the idea that the peptide is internalized, goes to the nucleus and maintains cells in a proliferative state by supporting ROD1-mediated inhibition of differentiation.","['Sadvakassova, Gulzhakhan', 'Dobocan, Monica C', 'Difalco, Marcos R', 'Congote, Luis F']","['Sadvakassova G', 'Dobocan MC', 'Difalco MR', 'Congote LF']","['Endocrine Laboratory, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal H3A 1A1, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (PTBP3 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thrombospondins)', '0 (thrombospondin 4)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Anemia/*blood/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Thrombospondins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Zidovudine']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21817 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2009 Sep;220(3):672-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21817.,10.1002/jcp.21817 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a unique gene that is involved in self-renewal in ESC and leukemic stem cell (LSC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To understand the mechanism(s) of SALL4 function(s), we sought to identify SALL4-associated proteins by tandem mass spectrometry. Components of a transcription repressor Mi-2/Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex were found in the SALL4-immunocomplexes with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in ESCs with endogenous SALL4 expression and 293T cells overexpressing SALL4. The SALL4-mediated transcriptional regulation was tested on two potential target genes: PTEN and SALL1. Both genes were confirmed as SALL4 downstream targets by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, and their expression levels, when tested by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were decreased in 293T cells overexpressing SALL4. Moreover, SALL4 binding sites at the promoter regions of PTEN and SALL1 were co-occupied by NuRD components, suggesting that SALL4 represses the transcriptions of PTEN and SALL1 through its interactions with the Mi-2/NuRD complex. The in vivo repressive effect(s) of SALL4 were evaluated in SALL4 transgenic mice, where decreased expressions of PTEN and SALL1 were associated with myeloid leukemia and cystic kidneys, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, we are the first to demonstrate that stem cell protein SALL4 represses its target genes, PTEN and SALL1, through the epigenetic repressor Mi-2/NuRD complex. Our novel finding provides insight into the mechanism(s) of SALL4 functions in kidney development and leukemogenesis.","['Lu, Jiayun', 'Jeong, Ha-Won', 'Kong, Nikki', 'Yang, Youyang', 'Carroll, John', 'Luo, Hongbo R', 'Silberstein, Leslie E', 'Yupoma', 'Chai, Li']","['Lu J', 'Jeong HW', 'Kong N', 'Yang Y', 'Carroll J', 'Luo HR', 'Silberstein LE', 'Yupoma', 'Chai L']","[""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital/Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['K08 CA097185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK063220/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016464/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL092437/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090518,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (SALL1 protein, human)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005577 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(5):e5577. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005577.

OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the incidence of cancer among pesticide applicators exposed to permethrin in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). METHODS: A total of 49,093 pesticide applicators were included in this analysis of the AHS, a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Detailed information on pesticide exposure and lifestyle factors was obtained from self-administered questionnaires completed in 1993-1997. Average length of follow-up since applicator enrollment in the cohort was 9.14 years. We used two permethrin exposure metrics: a) lifetime days applicators personally mixed or applied permethrin and b) intensity-weighted lifetime days (lifetime days weighted by estimated intensity of exposure). We used Poisson regression analysis to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for malignancies by tertiles of exposure. RESULTS: We found no associations between permethrin and all malignant neoplasms combined, or between permethrin and melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, or cancers of the colon, rectum, lung, or prostate. We found elevated and statistically significant risks for multiple myeloma in the highest tertiles of both lifetime exposure-days (RR = 5.72; 95% CI, 2.76-11.87) and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure-days (RR = 5.01; 95% CI, 2.41-10.42), compared with applicators reporting they never used permethrin; these results are based on only 15 exposed cases. These findings were similar across a variety of alternative exposure metrics, exposure categories, and reference groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association with most cancers analyzed. Although the suggested association with multiple myeloma was based on a small number of cases, it warrants further evaluation.","['Rusiecki, Jennifer A', 'Patel, Rahulkumar', 'Koutros, Stella', 'Beane-Freeman, Laura', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Bonner, Matthew R', 'Coble, Joseph', 'Lubin, Jay', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Hoppin, Jane A', 'Alavanja, Michael C R']","['Rusiecki JA', 'Patel R', 'Koutros S', 'Beane-Freeman L', 'Landgren O', 'Bonner MR', 'Coble J', 'Lubin J', 'Blair A', 'Hoppin JA', 'Alavanja MC']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799 , USA. jrusiecki@usuhs.mil']",['eng'],"['Z01 CP010119/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 ES049030/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20081110,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Insecticides)', '509F88P9SZ (Permethrin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Insecticides', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'North Carolina/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data', '*Permethrin']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.11318 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2009 Apr;117(4):581-6. doi: 10.1289/ehp.11318.

Epidemiological evidence has reported a direct link between exposure of non-smokers to environmental tobacco smoke and disease, most notably, lung cancer. Much evidence demonstrates that carcinogenic-DNA adducts are useful markers of tobacco smoke exposure, providing an integrated measurement of carcinogen intake, metabolic activation, and delivery to the DNA in target tissues. Monitoring accessible surrogate tissues, such as white blood cells or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, also provides a means of investigating passive and active tobacco exposure in healthy individuals and cancer patients. Levels of DNA adducts measured in many tissues of smokers are significantly higher than in non-smokers. While some studies have demonstrated an association between carcinogenic DNA adducts and cancer in current smokers, no association has been observed in ex or never smokers. The role of genetic susceptibility in the development of smoking related-cancer is essential. In order to establish whether smoking-related DNA adducts are biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure and/or its carcinogenic activity we summarized all data that associated tobacco smoke exposure and smoking-related DNA adducts both in controls and/or in cancer cases and studies where the effect of genetic polymorphisms involved in the activation and deactivation of carcinogens were also evaluated. In the future we hope we will be able to screen for lung cancer susceptibility by using specific biomarkers and that subjects of compared groups can be stratified for multiple potential modulators of biomarkers, taking into account various confounding factors.","['Lodovici, Maura', 'Bigagli, Elisabetta']","['Lodovici M', 'Bigagli E']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Florence, Viale Pieraccini 6, 50139 Florence, Italy. maura.lodovici@unifi.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090226,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Smoking/adverse effects/*metabolism', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph6030874 [doi]', 'ijerph6030874 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2009 Mar;6(3):874-88. doi: 10.3390/ijerph6030874.

Aberrant microRNA expression has been described for several human malignancies, and this new class of small regulatory RNAs has both oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions. Despite this knowledge, there is little information regarding microRNAs in plasma especially because microRNAs in plasma, if exist, were thought to be digested by RNase. Recent studies, however, have revealed that microRNAs exist and escape digestion in plasma. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed microRNA microaray to obtain insight into microRNA deregulation in the plasma of a leukemia patient. We have revealed that microRNA-638 (miR-638) is stably present in human plasmas, and microRNA-92a (miR-92a) dramatically decreased in the plasmas of acute leukemia patients. Especially, the ratio of miR-92a/miR-638 in plasma was very useful for distinguishing leukemia patients from healthy body.

All patients were treated with fludarabine (150 mg/m(2)) and melphalan (140 mg/m(2)) followed by transplantation from matched sibling (n=27) or unrelated (n=10) donors. The indications for reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic SCT (RIC-SCT) were as follows: (1) > or = 50 years, 16 (43.2%) and (2) decreased organ function or active infections, 21 (56.8%). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine for sibling and tacrolimus for unrelated transplants) and methotrexate. The cumulative incidence of acute (grades II-IV) and chronic GVHD was 43.2 and 65.6%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 36 months for surviving transplants, the 3-year relapse, non-relapse mortality, disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 19.7, 17.7, 62.6 and 64.1%, respectively. Transplants in first CR showed better transplantation outcomes than those in second CR. The potential of antileukemic activity of chronic GVHD was also found.

We treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a combined thalidomide/fludarabine regimen and monitored cellular and molecular changes induced by thalidomide in vivo before fludarabine treatment. Thalidomide was given daily (100 mg p.o. per day) and fludarabine was administered on days 7-11 (25 mg/m(2) i.v. per day) within each 4-week cycle (maximum of 6 cycles). Twenty patients received thalidomide/fludarabine as first-line therapy and 20 patients were previously treated. Unmutated IgVH mutation status was found in 36 cases and 13 had high-risk cytogenetic aberrations (del17p, del11q). The overall response rate was 80 and 25% for untreated and previously treated patients, respectively. Although thalidomide reduced the number of CLL cells, the number of CD3 lymphocytes showed no significant change, but the number of CD4(+)CD25(hi)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly decreased. Gene expression profiling revealed a thalidomide-induced signature containing both targets known to have a function in immunomodulatory drug action as well as novel candidate genes. Combined thalidomide/fludarabine therapy demonstrated efficacy in high-risk patients with CLL. Furthermore, our study provides novel biological insights into thalidomide effect, which might act by enhancing apoptosis of CLL cells and reducing Tregs, thereby enabling T-cell-dependent antitumor effect.","['Giannopoulos, K', 'Dmoszynska, A', 'Kowal, M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, E', 'Bojarska-Junak, A', 'Rolinski, J', 'Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Bullinger, L']","['Giannopoulos K', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Kowal M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Rolinski J', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bullinger L']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090514,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/11/06 06:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200998 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.98 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Oct;23(10):1771-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.98.

In this study, we investigate the function of STAT6 in cHL cell lines and show that STAT6 promotes survival of these cells. Microarray expression analysis of STAT6-shRNA (short hairpin RNA)-expressing cHL cell lines was carried out to analyze the STAT6-mediated survival mechanism. Some of the identified genes with potentially important regulatory functions were also interleukin (IL)-4 dependently regulated in Ramos B cells and binding of STAT6 to the regulatory regions of several genes could be confirmed, indicating that these are direct STAT6 target genes. Importantly, STAT6 knockdown increased the expression and activation of STAT1 as well as the expression of known STAT1 target genes, indicating a cross-regulation between these signaling molecules. Forced expression of STAT1 was able to induce apoptosis in cHL cell line L1236.

However, there is also risk -- theoretical, at least -- that such a strategy may increase the side effects of traditional therapies, including but not limited to treatment-related secondary malignancies. Before being brought to clinical application, therefore, important questions remain to be answered regarding how these therapies will be tailored to achieve benefit without concomitantly increasing harm. A potential solution may involve targeting so-called ""synthetic lethalities"" in tumor DNA repair pathways; taking advantage of defects acquired in DNA repair pathways during tumorigenesis by targeting alternative repair pathways on which the tumor critically depends. Conceivably, as repair pathways are functional in normal tissue, such targeted therapy should be relatively tumor-specific and non-toxic. We review here the rationale for this strategy, describe examples of its application, and outline potential strengths and weaknesses of this approach. For simplicity, a focus will be placed on the repair of double-strand breaks as a model system, but the conceptual framework is generally applicable to many other pathways of DNA repair.","['Moeller, Benjamin J', 'Pasqualini, Renata', 'Arap, Wadih']","['Moeller BJ', 'Pasqualini R', 'Arap W']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090615,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,['EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)'],IM,"['DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/08/15 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/15 09:00 [medline]']","['8743 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.12.8743 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Jun 15;8(12):1872-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.12.8743.

We tested whether this was true of leukemic cells, using cell lines from leukemic patients (CEM, 697, Mn-60, and Tanoue). We found that addition of catalase inhibited proliferation of all cell lines and induced death in two. However, this turned out to be due to arginase contamination of the catalase. Pure arginase inhibited cell proliferation and survival, which was reversible by adding L-arginine, demonstrating the L-arginine dependency of these cells. The glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen killed the cells by a novel, rapid form of death, preceded by cell blebbing and prevented by N-acetylcysteine, suggesting toxicity is not due to ebselen's antioxidant activity. Addition of N-acetylcysteine to remove endogenous H(2)O(2) stimulated survival and proliferation, suggesting that basal levels of H(2)O(2) promoted cell death. Consistent with this, leukemic cell death was induced by adding as little as 5 microM H(2)O(2). Ascorbic acid, even at 100 microM, induced death through H(2)O(2) production. Thus H(2)O(2) does not promote proliferation and survival, rather the opposite, and previous literature may have misinterpreted the effects of antioxidants. Arginase, H(2)O(2), ascorbic acid, and ebselen might be useful in the treatment of leukemia.","['Brown, Richard D', 'Burke, G A Amos', 'Brown, Guy C']","['Brown RD', 'Burke GA', 'Brown GC']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. rdb34@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Azoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '40X2P7DPGH (ebselen)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Arginase/metabolism', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism', 'Azoles/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', '*Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Isoindoles', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/metabolism']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(09)00079-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2009 Apr 15;46(8):1211-20. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.02.001.

Although MLLs are important gene regulators little is known about their own regulation. Herein, to understand the effects of toxic stress on MLL gene regulation, we treated human cells with a common food contaminant mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol (DON). Our results demonstrate that MLLs and Hox genes are overexpressed upon exposure to DON. Studies using specific inhibitors demonstrated that Src kinase families are involved in upstream events in DON-mediated upregulation of MLL1. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the MLL1 promoter contains multiple Sp1-binding sites and importantly, the binding of Sp1 is enriched in the MLL1 promoter upon exposure to DON. Moreover, antisense-mediated knockdown of Sp1 diminished DON-induced MLL1 upregulation. These results demonstrated that MLL1 gene expression is sensitive to toxic stress and Sp1 plays crucial roles in the stress-induced upregulation of MLL1.","['Ansari, Khairul I', 'Hussain, Imran', 'Das, Hriday K', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Ansari KI', 'Hussain I', 'Das HK', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, TX 76019, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090505,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (AG 1879)', '0 (HOXA7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Trichothecenes)', '148710-93-4 (Sp2 Transcription Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'JT37HYP23V (deoxynivalenol)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sp2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Trichothecenes/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/07/18 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [medline]']","['EJB7055 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07055.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Jun;276(12):3299-307. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07055.x.

The aims of this study were to investigate gene expression of key regulatory mediators of innate immune responses in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) to P. gingivalis LPS and to compare these results with those obtained using the TLR-4 ligand, Escherichia coli LPS. Custom-made Taqman low-density arrays were used for expression profiling of 45 different cytokine-related genes. Both types of LPS highly up-regulated interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-1beta, IL-18 receptor (IL-18R), IL-18R accessory protein and IL-1 family (IL-1F)9. Expression levels of IL-1F6, IL-1F7 and caspase-1 were unaltered by either LPS. Genes for tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, leukaemia inhibitory factor and IL-32 were also highly induced by both LPS. For a subset of genes, including CXC chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), expression was induced only by E. coli LPS or was up-regulated more highly by E. coli compared with P. gingivalis LPS in THP-1 monocytes. A similar expression pattern was also observed in dendritic cells. Analysis of signalling pathways which lead to CXCL5 expression indicated that the mechanisms underpinning the differential responses did not involve the recruitment of different adaptor proteins by TLR-2 and TLR-4, and therefore occur downstream of the receptor-adaptor complex. We conclude that differences in signalling pathways activated by TLR-2 and TLR-4 ligands lead to differential innate immune responses which may be important in polymicrobial diseases such as periodontal disease.","['Barksby, H E', 'Nile, C J', 'Jaedicke, K M', 'Taylor, J J', 'Preshaw, P M']","['Barksby HE', 'Nile CJ', 'Jaedicke KM', 'Taylor JJ', 'Preshaw PM']","['Periodontal Immunobiology Research Group, School of Dental Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],['DHCS/03/G121/46/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (CXCL5 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL5)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'MWC0ET1L2P (monophosphoryl lipid A)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL5/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lipid A/analogs & derivatives/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['CEI3920 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03920.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2009 Jun;156(3):479-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03920.x.,10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03920.x [doi],PMC2691977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over-production of proinflammatory cytokines and an increase in HTLV-1 proviral load are features of HAM/TSP, but the immunological basis of IDH has not been established. In addition to severe cutaneous manifestations, the importance of IDH relies on the observation that up to 30% of children with IDH develop HAM/TSP in childhood and adolescence. In this study we determined the immune response in patients with IDH measuring interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels as well as the HTLV-1 proviral load. Additionally, regulatory cytokines and anti-cytokines were added to cultures to evaluate the ability of these molecules to down-modulate TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma synthesis. HTLV-1 carriers and patients with HAM/TSP served as controls. TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were higher in IDH than in HTLV-1 carriers. There was no difference in IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha concentrations in IDH and HAM/TSP patients. There was a tendency for higher IL-4 mRNA expression and immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in IDH than in HTLV-1 carriers, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The HTLV-1 proviral load was significantly higher in IDH patients than in HTLV-1 carriers. IDH is characterized by an exaggerated Th1 immune response and high HTLV-1 proviral load. The similarities between the immunological response in patients with IDH and HAM/TSP and the high proviral load observed in IDH provide support that IDH is a risk factor for development of HAM/TSP.","['Nascimento, M C F', 'Primo, J', 'Bittencourt, A', 'Siqueira, I', 'de Fatima Oliveira, M', 'Meyer, R', 'Schriefer, A', 'Santos, S B', 'Carvalho, E M']","['Nascimento MC', 'Primo J', 'Bittencourt A', 'Siqueira I', 'de Fatima Oliveira M', 'Meyer R', 'Schriefer A', 'Santos SB', 'Carvalho EM']","['Servico de Imunologia, Hospital Universitario Professor Edgard Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['D43 TW007127/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'D43 TW007127-05/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Carrier State/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/blood', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood', 'Viral Load']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['CEI3869 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03869.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2009 Jun;156(3):455-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03869.x.,10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03869.x [doi],PMC2691974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous abnormalities of chromosome 8 (trisomy or tetrasomy) have been identified in association with LC. We performed fluorescent in situ analysis on cutaneous tissue using directly labelled probes for various gene loci often involved in patients with AML; these tests showed deletion of p53 and excluded trisomy 8. However, application of probes for AML/ETO, MYC and telomere 8q revealed a gain at 8q22/8q24/8q telomere in a significant number of infiltrating cells.

Intracellular signals mediated by wild-type Flt3 are involved in cell differentiation and survival whereas signalling via the mutant Flt3 ITD (internal tandem duplication) promotes enhanced cell growth. In this study, we identified tyrosines 768, 955 and 969 of Flt3 as phosphorylation sites and mediators of growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2) interaction, leading to the association of Grb2 associated binder 2 (Gab2) and contributing to proliferation and survival. Ba/F3 cells were transfected with either the wild-type Flt3 or the ITD, with or without a triple mutation of the Grb2 binding sites, and characterised in terms of proliferation and viability. Interestingly, the Flt3 ITD promoted increased survival but after introducing the triple mutation, this phenotype was lost. When looking into different downstream pathways, this effect was mainly caused by decreased phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Stat5 signalling, and the Flt3 ITD carrying the Grb2 binding mutations showed less Akt and Stat5 activation compared to the regular Flt3 ITD receptor.

The three markers may be discordant in the single case and there is no consensus on their combined use in clinical practise. This multicenter study investigated this issue. Two-hundred and sixty-two Binet stage A patients were studied for the three markers. Sixty patients were profiled with HG-U133A gene expression chips. Disease progression was determined by time from diagnosis to treatment (TTT). The probability of being treatment-free at 3 years was significantly shorter in patients with unmutated IGHV genes (IGHVunmut 66% vs. 93%, chi square of log-rank = 30, P < 0.0001), ZAP-70 positive (ZAP-70pos 73% vs. 96%, chi square of log-rank = 8.2, P = 0.004) or CD38-positive cells (CD38pos 68% vs. 91%, chi square of log-rank = 21, P < 0.0001). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that the three markers had an independent predictive value for TTT of similar power. A prognostic system based on presence of none (low-risk), one (intermediate-risk) or two or three (high-risk) markers was generated. Based on such criteria, 56%, 23% and 21% of cases were clustered in low (HR = 1), intermediate [HR = 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4-5.8] and high-risk group (HR = 8.0, 95% CI 3.9-16.2).

The relationship between MBL and Rai 0 CLL, as well as the impact of biological risk factors on MBL prognosis, are unknown. Out of 460 B-cell expansions with CLL-phenotype, 123 clinical MBL (cMBL) were compared to 154 Rai 0 CLL according to clinical and biological profile and outcome. cMBL had better humoral immune capacity and lower infection risk, lower prevalence of del11q22-q23/del17p13 and TP53 mutations, slower lymphocyte doubling time, and longer treatment-free survival. Also, cMBL diagnosis was a protective factor for treatment risk. Despite these favourable features, all cMBL were projected to progress, and lymphocytes <1.2 x 10(9)/l and >3.7 x 10(9)/l were the best thresholds predicting the lowest and highest risk of progression to CLL. Although IGHV status, CD38 and CD49d expression, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) karyotype individually predicted treatment-free survival, multivariate analysis identified the presence of +12 or del17p13 as the sole independent predictor of treatment requirement in cMBL (Hazard ratio: 5.39, 95% confidence interval 1.98-14.44, P = 0.001). Overall, these data showed that cMBL has a more favourable clinical course than Rai 0 CLL.

G-CSF (Lenograstim, 263 microg/d) or placebo was administered from day 8 after the end of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 10(9)/l (or for up to 10 d). Eight hundred and three patients were entered. Neutrophil recovery was quicker with G-CSF (P < 0.0001), but this did not lead to differences in the number, severity or duration of infections. There were no substantial supportive care savings, although G-CSF patients spent 2 d less in hospital (P = 0.01). Complete remission (CR) rates were similar between arms (73% G-CSF, 75% placebo, P = 0.5), as were reasons for failure (induction death: P = 0.7; resistant disease: P = 0.5) and, for remitters, 5-year disease-free survival (34% vs. 38%, P = 0.3). Overall survival at 5 years was 29% with G-CSF vs. 36% with placebo (P = 0.10). Both CR rate (P = 0.006) and overall survival (P = 0.006) were worse with G-CSF in patients aged <40 years, but this may be a chance effect.

The complete response rate with induction therapy was 89%, and decreased with increasing age, mainly due to higher induction mortality. All post-induction treatments were delivered on an outpatient basis. The most common complications during intensification were infections (47%), osteonecrosis (32%), venous thromboembolism (23%) and neuropathy (22%). At a median follow-up of 4 years, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 63% and 71%, respectively. Significant adverse predictors for OS were age >35 years, high white blood cell count, MLL rearrangement, allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission and <80% of the planned asparaginase dose delivered during intensification. Patients aged < or = 35 years had a 3 year OS of 83%, as compared to 52% for patients aged >35 years. We conclude that the administration of this paediatric regimen is feasible and has considerable activity in adult ALL, particularly in younger patients. Effective delivery of asparaginase dosing appears to be important in achieving an optimal antileukaemic effect.","['Storring, John M', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Kao, Susan', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Yee, Karen W L', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Chang, Hong', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Xu, Wei', 'Brandwein, Joseph M']","['Storring JM', 'Minden MD', 'Kao S', 'Gupta V', 'Schuh AC', 'Schimmer AD', 'Yee KW', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Chang H', 'Lipton JH', 'Messner HA', 'Xu W', 'Brandwein JM']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Haematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20090504,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/09/11 06:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7712 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07712.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Jun;146(1):76-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07712.x.

Glycophorin A (GPA) is a sialoglycoprotein that associates with AE1 in erythrocytes forming the Wrb (Wright b) blood group antigen. These two integral proteins may also form a complex during biosynthesis, with GPA facilitating the cell surface expression of AE1. This study investigates the interaction of GPA with AE1 in K562 cells, a human erythroleukaemic cell line that expresses GPA, and the role of GPA in the cell surface expression of AE1. In K562 cells, GPA was dimeric and N- and O-glycosylated similar to erythroid GPA. GPA was localized at the cell surface, but also localized to the Golgi. AE1 expressed in K562 cells contained both complex and high-mannose oligosaccharides, and co-localized with GPA at the cell surface and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Wrb antigen was detected at the cell surface of AE1-transfected K562 cells, indicating the existence of an AE1-GPA complex. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies using AE1 and an ER-localized hereditary spherocytosis mutant (R760Q AE1) showed that GPA and AE1 could interact in the ER. GPA knockdown by shRNAs (small-hairpin RNAs), however, had no effect on the level of cell surface expression of AE1. The results indicate that AE1 and GPA form a complex in the ER of human K562 cells, but that both proteins can also traffic to the cell surface independently of each other.","['Pang, Allison J', 'Reithmeier, Reinhart A F']","['Pang AJ', 'Reithmeier RA']","[""Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Medical Sciences Building, Toronto, Canada, M5S 1A8.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090715,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Glycophorins)']",IM,"['Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycophorins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport']",2009/05/15 09:00,2009/08/29 09:00,['2009/05/15 09:00'],"['2009/05/15 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/29 09:00 [medline]']","['BJ20090345 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20090345 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2009 Jul 15;421(3):345-56. doi: 10.1042/BJ20090345.,10.1042/BJ20090345 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of osteoarticular syndrome at the onset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood, the clinical and laboratory specificity of such patients and the prognostic value of osteoarticular syndrome as an initial symptom. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 60 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at a mean age of 5 +/- 0.5 years between February 2002 and October 2007. RESULTS: Osteoarticular syndrome was present as an initial symptom of leukemia in 18 (30.5%) patients. The oligoarticular involvement was prevalent--in 8 children (44%). Middle-sized joints were affected more commonly--in 10 patients (55.6%), followed by large joints and spine. Laboratory results in patients with osteoarticular syndrome show more often normal or slightly decreased platelet count, higher values of lactate dehydrogenase and rarely--leukocytosis (> 20 x 10(9)/l). Parablasts in the blood film were detected in 13 children (72.2%) with osteoarticular syndrome. Event-free survival in patients with osteoarticular syndrome is comparable to that of the remaining group of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

We used bisulfite-PCR Pyrosequencing to quantitatively measure the DNA methylation of five different DNA repetitive elements in normal tissue and cancer. In all we studied 10 different tissues from four individuals undergoing autopsy, 34 paired normal and tumor tissues from patients with bladder cancer, 58 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and 23 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. We found that the DNA methylation of interspersed repeats (LINE1 and Alu Yb8) was very consistent from person to person and tissue to tissue while tandem DNA repeats appeared more variable in normal tissues. In bladder cancer we found clear hypomethylation of LINE1, Alu Yb8, Sat-alpha and NBL-2. Conversely, we found an increase in the DNA methylation levels of D4Z4 from normal to cancer. In contrast leukemia showed no significant changes in the DNA methylation of LINE1 and Alu Yb8, but DNA methylation increases in NBL-2 and D4Z4 tandem repeats. Our findings show that the changes in DNA methylation levels of individual DNA repetitive elements are unique for each repetitive element, which may reflect distinct epigenetic factors and may have important implications in the use of DNA methylation of repetitive elements as global DNA methylation biomarkers.","['Choi, Si Ho', 'Worswick, Scott', 'Byun, Hyang-Min', 'Shear, Talia', 'Soussa, John C', 'Wolff, Erika M', 'Douer, Dan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Liang, Gangning', 'Yang, Allen S']","['Choi SH', 'Worswick S', 'Byun HM', 'Shear T', 'Soussa JC', 'Wolff EM', 'Douer D', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Liang G', 'Yang AS']","['Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology, Center for Blood Diseases, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA086871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007048/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '5P30ES07048/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA86871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Alu Elements/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/genetics', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24384 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Aug 1;125(3):723-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24384.,10.1002/ijc.24384 [doi],PMC4086885,['NIHMS587075'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to acute myelotic leukemia (AML), an allogenic peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation with subsequent immunosupression with mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and ciclosporin A had been performed 8 years previously. The patient had discontinued treatment on his own after about 2 years, having suffered a cerebroischemic insult in the meantime. INVESTIGATIONS: Histological examinations revealed sclerodermatous changes. Titres of antinuclear antibodies were unremarkable. Laser-Doppler-flowmetry also indicated an active inflammatory and sclerosing process. FACS analysis of the peripheral blood did not reveal signs of AML recurrence. DIAGNOSIS, THERAPY AND COURSE: The histological pattern in conjunction with the anamnesis indicated a cutaneous chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). No further organ involvement was observed. The MMF therapy which the patient had discontinued was restarted. In addition, PUVA therapy was initiated. These measures and intensive physiotherapeutic exercises in parallel prevented further progression of the sclerosis and secondary mobility limitations. The ulcers healed completely with pentoxifylline and anti-infective treatment. CONCLUSION: After stem-cell transplantation, early diagnosis of GvHD is especially important due to possible irreversible sclerodermatous changes and other organ manifestations. Also for this reason, strict clinical follow-up is especially important with respect to compliance and efficacy of the immunosuppression.","['Neid, T', 'Danz, B', 'Eismann, R', 'Bramsiepe, I', 'Wohlrab, J', 'Marsch, W C', 'Fiedler, E']","['Neid T', 'Danz B', 'Eismann R', 'Bramsiepe I', 'Wohlrab J', 'Marsch WC', 'Fiedler E']","['Universitatsklinik und Poliklinik fur Dermatologie und Venerologie der Martin-Luther-Universitat Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale).']",['ger'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090512,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Laser-Doppler Flowmetry', 'Leg Ulcer/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'PUVA Therapy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Pentoxifylline/therapeutic use', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Scleroderma, Localized/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vasodilator Agents/therapeutic use']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1222575 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2009 May;134(21):1106-9. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1222575.

PATIENTS: 96 patients (average age 7.1 years) were included, treated with chemotherapy in 15 German study centres between 1997 and 2003. METHODS: The HRQL was assessed based on both the parent report (POQOLS) and the patient self-report (KINDL) at 3 intervals: up to 2 weeks after diagnosis (T1), upon completion of the re-induction therapy (T2) and at the end of the maintenance therapy (T3). To analyse the changes of HRQL over time, the differences between the individual scores (T2-T1 and T3-T1) were calculated and statistically tested. The HRQL results from KINDL were also compared to a sample from the German general population. RESULTS: POQOLS (scale 0 (optimum) to 6): A decrease of HRQL was found in the domain ""activity"" at T1 (mean score=3.1) and T2 (mean score=2.6). Over time, HRQL improved significantly with a mean score-difference T3-T1=-0.7 (p=0.001). KINDL (scale 0 to 100 (optimum)): The individual HRQL-scores improved over time with the major increases occurring in the domains ""physical"" with a mean score-difference T2-T1=21.7 (p<0.0001) and a mean score-difference T3-T1=20.6 (p=0.0002) and ""mental"" with a mean score-difference T2-T1=7.1 (p=0.02) and T3-T1=8.1 (p=0.02). However, the mean overall HRQL-score was significantly lower compared to the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL show lower HRQL compared to the general population. Over time, HRQL improved significantly from both the patient and the parent perspective.","['Peeters, J', 'Meitert, J', 'Paulides, M', 'Wiener, A', 'Beck, J D', 'Calaminus, G', 'Langer, T']","['Peeters J', 'Meitert J', 'Paulides M', 'Wiener A', 'Beck JD', 'Calaminus G', 'Langer T']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Paediatric Oncology/Immunology, Erlangen, Germany. joanna.peeters@uk-erlangen.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090512,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Caregivers/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Long-Term Care/psychology', 'Male', 'Population Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment/psychology', 'Sick Role']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/08/22 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/22 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0029-1216366 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2009 May-Jun;221(3):156-61. doi: 10.1055/s-0029-1216366.

METHODS: The data are registry-based and present a unique collection in terms of control and homogeneity. Survival was explored using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox model. Restricted cubic splines were used to illustrate the nonlinearity of the age and year of diagnosis effect for the four chosen diagnoses. RESULTS: The data set includes 1827 children examined from 1957 to 2002 with the follow-up ending 2007. The overall 5-year survival increased from 0.26 (95%CI [0.21, 0.33]) before 1973 to 0.8 (95% CI [0.74, 0.85]) for patients diagnosed in the period 1998-2002. It is best for Hodgkin disease and leukemia; for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and intracranial and intraspinal neoplasms (CNS) the rate of improvement has been slowing down since 1990. Survival is significantly associated with age at diagnosis for patients with leukemia, CNS, NHL, and neuroblastoma (p < .001), the association varies between diseases. Hazard decreases with age for children with CNS and NHL, increases for children with neuroblastoma, and is quadratic with its lowest point at the age of about 5 years for children with leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The survival experience in Slovenia compares well with those of large samples in the United States SEER program 1975-1995 and the data collected by ACCIS from 62 population-based cancer registries in Europe. The hazard of dying has been decreasing constantly, mainly due to improvements in leukemia treatment.","['Perme, Maja Pohar', 'Jereb, Berta']","['Perme MP', 'Jereb B']","['Institute of Biomedical Informatics, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. maja.pohar@mf.uni-lj.si']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Slovenia/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate/*trends']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/06/27 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [medline]']","['911129516 [pii]', '10.1080/08880010902900437 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jun;26(4):240-51. doi: 10.1080/08880010902900437.,10.1080/08880010902900437 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize characteristics of farm workers (i.e., demographics, health care) from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) and the California Agricultural Workers Survey (CAWS) and present findings from a series of studies conducted among farm workers in California. The epidemiology literature was reviewed and methods for a unique farm worker union-based epidemiologic study are presented. Farm workers in California and the rest of the United States, many of whom are seasonal and migrant workers are at elevated risk for numerous forms of cancer compared to the general population and specific pesticides may be associated with this altered risk. Elevated risks have been found for lymphomas and prostate, brain, leukemia, cervix, and stomach cancers.","['Mills, Paul K', 'Dodge, Jennifer', 'Yang, Richard']","['Mills PK', 'Dodge J', 'Yang R']","['Cancer Registry of Central California, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.

Both agents showed inhibitory effects on leukemia cell proliferation, with mean IC(50) values of 6.25 micromol/L for TMPP and 23.7 micromol/L for DMPP, indicating that inhibition appeared to be dependent on the number of bromine atoms in the structure. Further, TMPP at 10 micromol/L and DMPP at 20 micromol/L induced G2/M cell cycle block in leukemia cells, and TMPP at 20 micromol/L induced apoptosis in these cells. TMPP treatment effected a reduction in both cell cycle progression signals (FoxM1, KIS, Cdc25B, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, and Aurora-B) and tumor cell survival (p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1)), as well as induced the activation of caspase-3 and -9. Further, treatment with TMPP significantly reduced the viability of AML specimens derived from AML patients, but only slightly reduced the viability of normal ALDH(hi) progenitor cells. We also observed that FoxM1 mRNA was overexpressed in AML cells, and treatment with TMPP reduced FoxM1 mRNA expression in AML cells. Here, we report on the synthesis of TMPP and DMPP and demonstrate that these agents hinder proliferation of leukemia cells by FoxM1 suppression, which leads to G2/M cell cycle block and subsequent caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in acute leukemia cells. These agents may facilitate the development of new strategies in targeted antileukemic therapy.","['Nakamura, Satoki', 'Yamashita, Mitsuji', 'Yokota, Daisuke', 'Hirano, Isao', 'Ono, Takaaki', 'Fujie, Michio', 'Shibata, Kiyoshi', 'Niimi, Taishi', 'Suyama, Takuya', 'Maddali, Kasthuraiah', 'Asai, Kazuhide', 'Yamashita, Junko', 'Iguchi, Yukiko', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Nakamura S', 'Yamashita M', 'Yokota D', 'Hirano I', 'Ono T', 'Fujie M', 'Shibata K', 'Niimi T', 'Suyama T', 'Maddali K', 'Asai K', 'Yamashita J', 'Iguchi Y', 'Ohnishi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu city, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan. satonaka@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090514,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (2,3,4-tribromo-3-methyl-1-phenylphospholane 1-oxide)', '0 (2,3-dibromo-3-methyl-1-phenylphospholane 1-oxide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclic P-Oxides)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (phospholenes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic P-Oxides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']",2009/05/14 09:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-009-9255-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2010 Aug;28(4):381-91. doi: 10.1007/s10637-009-9255-3.

Its use is indicated for first-and second-line treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). FAMP as a single agent has produced superior response rates and progression-free survival than standard therapy with chlorambucil and alkylator-based regimen. Efficacy of FAMP may be increased by combining this purine analog with other chemotherapeutic and non-chemotherapeutic agents. FAMP and cyclophosphamide combination (FC) has shown promising results with higher overall response and complete response rates than FAMP in monotherapy, although no difference has been detected in survival. Quality of response and eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) have been reported to be associated with prolonged survival. Eradication of MRD has been achieved by combining FC with mitoxantrone or monoclonal antibody including alemtuzumab or rituximab or both. FAMP has been widely used in non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, often combined with a variety of other cytotoxic agents, with the aim of inducing enough immunosuppression to allow successful engraftment and to exert some pretransplant anti-tumor activity. The current paper provides an overview of use of FAMP as a single agent or as a cornerstone of different therapeutic strategies for treatment of B-CLL patients.","['Ricci, Francesca', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Montillo, Marco']","['Ricci F', 'Tedeschi A', 'Morra E', 'Montillo M']","[""Department of Oncology/Haematology, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090326,New Zealand,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,101253281,,,,2009/05/14 09:00,2009/05/14 09:01,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/14 09:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/tcrm.s3688 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2009 Feb;5(1):187-207. doi: 10.2147/tcrm.s3688.

Here, we analyzed the pattern of IL4I1 protein expression in 315 human lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. Besides PMBL, IL4I1 expression in tumors was very frequent. IL4I1 was detected in tumor-associated macrophages from most of the tumors and in neoplastic cells from follicular lymphoma, classic and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas and small lymphocytic lymphoma, three of which are germinal center derived. IL4I1-positive tumor cells were also detected in rare cases of solid cancers, mainly mesothelioma. The enzymatic activity paralleled protein expression, suggesting that IL4I1 is functional in vivo. Depending on the tumor type, IL4I1 may impact on different infiltrating lymphocyte populations with consequences on tumor evolution. In the particular case of follicular lymphoma cells, which are susceptible to antitumor cytotoxic T cells killing but depend on interactions with local T helper cells for survival, a high level of IL4I1 expression seems associated with the absence of bone marrow involvement and a better outcome.

We examined the baseline profile of a panel of T-ALL cell lines to determine factors that contribute to GC resistance without prior drug selection. Transcriptional profiling indicated GC resistance in T-ALL is associated with a proliferative phenotype involving upregulation of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, cholesterol biosynthesis and glutamate metabolism, increased growth rates and activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MYC signalling pathways. Importantly, the presence of these transcriptional signatures in primary ALL specimens significantly predicted patient outcome. We conclude that in lymphocytes the activation of bioenergetic pathways required for proliferation may suppress the apoptotic potential and offset the metabolic crisis initiated by GC signalling. It is likely that the link between GC resistance and proliferation in T-ALL has not been fully appreciated to date because such effects would be masked in the context of current multiagent therapies. The data also provide the first evidence that altered expression of wild-type MLL may contribute to GC-resistant phenotypes.

The intervening 2 decades have uncovered a plethora of biologic functions transduced by the GM-CSF receptor (pleiotropy) and revealed distinct signaling networks that couple the receptor to biologic outcomes. Unlike other hemopoietin receptors, the GM-CSF receptor has a significant nonredundant role in myeloid hematologic malignancies, macrophage-mediated acute and chronic inflammation, pulmonary homeostasis, and allergic disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying GM-CSF receptor activation have recently been revealed by the crystal structure of the GM-CSF receptor complexed to GM-CSF, which shows an unexpected higher order assembly. Emerging evidence also suggests the existence of intracellular signosomes that are recruited in a concentration-dependent fashion to selectively control cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation by GM-CSF. These findings begin to unravel the mystery of cytokine receptor pleiotropy and are likely to also apply to the related IL-3 and IL-5 receptors as well as other heterodimeric cytokine receptors.

In the National Cancer Institute's formaldehyde cohort, previously followed through December 31, 1979, and updated through December 31, 1994, formaldehyde exposure was associated with an increased risk for leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, that increased with peak and average intensity of exposure. METHODS: We extended follow-up through December 31, 2004 (median follow-up = 42 years), for 25 619 workers employed at one of 10 formaldehyde-using or formaldehyde-producing plants before 1966. We used Poisson regression to calculate relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine associations between quantitative formaldehyde exposure estimates (peak exposure, average intensity and cumulative exposure) and death from lymphohematopoietic malignancies. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered to be significant at P = .05. RESULTS: When follow-up ended in 2004, there were statistically significant increased risks for the highest vs lowest peak formaldehyde exposure category (> or =4 parts per million [ppm] vs >0 to <2.0 ppm) and all lymphohematopoietic malignancies (RR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.81, P trend = .02) and Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 3.96; 95% CI = 1.31 to 12.02, P trend = .01). Statistically nonsignificant associations were observed for multiple myeloma (RR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.01 to 4.12, P trend > .50), all leukemia (RR = 1.42; 95% CI = 0.92 to 2.18, P trend = .12), and myeloid leukemia (RR = 1.78; 95% CI = 0.87 to 3.64, P trend = .13). There was little evidence of association for any lymphohematopoietic malignancy with average intensity or cumulative exposure at the end of follow-up in 2004. However, disease associations varied over time. For peak exposure, the highest formaldehyde-related risks for myeloid leukemia occurred before 1980, but trend tests attained statistical significance in 1990 only. After the mid-1990s, the formaldehyde-related risk of myeloid leukemia declined. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of risks over time suggests a possible link between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia but also perhaps Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Observed patterns could be due to chance but are also consistent with a causal association within the relatively short induction-incubation periods characteristic of leukemogenesis. Further epidemiological study and exploration of potential molecular mechanisms are warranted.","['Beane Freeman, Laura E', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Stewart, Patricia A', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Hoover, Robert N', 'Hauptmann, Michael']","['Beane Freeman LE', 'Blair A', 'Lubin JH', 'Stewart PA', 'Hayes RB', 'Hoover RN', 'Hauptmann M']","['Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. freemala@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090512,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*etiology/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk', 'United States']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['djp096 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djp096 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 May 20;101(10):751-61. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djp096.

To explore the epigenetic alterations of miRNAs in ALL, we analyzed the methylation and chromatin status of the miR-124a loci in ALL. Expression of miR-124a was down-regulated in ALL by hypermethylation of the promoter and histone modifications including decreased levels of 3mk4H3 and AcH3 and increased levels of 2mK9H3, 3mK9H3, and 3mK27H3. Epigenetic down-regulation of miR-124a induced an up-regulation of its target, CDK6, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and contributed to the abnormal proliferation of ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) inhibition by sodium butyrate or PD-0332991 decreased ALL cell growth in vitro, whereas overexpression of pre-miR124a led to decreased tumorigenicity in a xenogeneic in vivo Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mouse model. The clinical implications of these findings were analyzed in a group of 353 patients diagnosed with ALL. Methylation of hsa-miR-124a was observed in 59% of the patients, which correlated with down-regulation of miR-124a (P < 0.001). Furthermore, hypermethylation of hsa-miR-124a was associated with higher relapse rate (P = 0.001) and mortality rate (P < 0.001), being an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.005) in the multivariate analysis. These results provide the grounds for new therapeutic strategies in ALL either targeting the epigenetic regulation of microRNAs and/or directly targeting the CDK6-Rb pathway.","['Agirre, Xabier', 'Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Martin-Subero, Jose Ignacio', 'Cordeu, Lucia', 'Garate, Leire', 'San Jose-Eneriz, Edurne', 'Abizanda, Gloria', 'Rodriguez-Otero, Paula', 'Fortes, Puri', 'Rifon, Jose', 'Bandres, Eva', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Martin, Vanesa', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Prosper, Felipe']","['Agirre X', 'Vilas-Zornoza A', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Cordeu L', 'Garate L', 'San Jose-Eneriz E', 'Abizanda G', 'Rodriguez-Otero P', 'Fortes P', 'Rifon J', 'Bandres E', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Martin V', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A', 'Siebert R', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Prosper F']","['Hematology Department and Area of Cell Therapy, Clinica Universitaria and Division of Gene Therapy and Hepatology, Foundation for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090512,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN124 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4025 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4025 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 May 15;69(10):4443-53. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4025.

We hypothesized that the incorporation of PMEGpp into DNA during repair resynthesis would result in the inhibition of DNA repair and the accumulation of DNA breaks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells that would activate signaling pathways to cell death. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To test this hypothesis, CLL cells were irradiated with UV light to stimulate nucleotide excision repair pathways, enabling the incorporation of PMEGpp into DNA. The combination effects of GS-9219 and DNA-damaging agents and the signaling mechanisms activated in response to DNA repair inhibition by GS-9219, as well as changes in CLL cell viability, were investigated. RESULTS: PMEGpp was incorporated into DNA in CLL cells when nucleotide excision repair was activated by UV. Following PMEGpp incorporation, DNA repair was inhibited, which led to the accumulation of DNA strand breaks. The presence of DNA strand breaks activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase family members ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and DNA-dependent protein kinase. P53 was phosphorylated and stabilized in response to the inhibition of DNA repair. P53 targeted proteins, Puma and Bax, were up-regulated and activated. The combination of GS-9219 and DNA-damaging agents resulted in more cell death than the sum of the single agents alone. CONCLUSION: GS-9219 inhibits DNA repair in CLL cells, an action that stimulates signaling pathways for apoptosis induction.","['Tsai, Cheng-Yu', 'Ray, Adrian S', 'Tumas, Daniel B', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Reiser, Hans', 'Plunkett, William']","['Tsai CY', 'Ray AS', 'Tumas DB', 'Keating MJ', 'Reiser H', 'Plunkett W']","['Departments of Experimental Therapeutics and Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090512,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (rabacfosadine)', '114088-58-3 (9-((2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl)guanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2848 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2848 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Jun 1;15(11):3760-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2848.

In this study, LL-37 was shown to kill Jurkat T leukemia cells via apoptosis. A loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization were detected following LL-37 exposure, whereas apoptosis was independent of caspase family members. The specific apoptotic pathway induced by LL-37 was defined through the utilization of Jurkat cells modified to express antiapoptotic proteins, as well as cells deficient in various proteins associated with apoptosis. Of interest, both Bcl-2-overexpressing cells and cells deficient in Bax and Bak proteins displayed a significant reduction in LL-37-induced apoptosis. In addition, Jurkat cells modified in the Fas receptor-associated pathway showed no reduction in apoptosis when exposed to LL-37. Analysis of the involvement of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in LL-37-mediated apoptosis revealed that AIF transferred from the mitochondria to the nucleus of cells exposed to LL-37, where it may lead to large-scale DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. AIF knockdown analysis resulted in LL-37-resistant cells. This suggests that AIF is mandatory in LL-37-mediated killing. Lastly, chelation or inhibition of Ca(2+) or calpains inhibited LL-37-mediated killing. Further analysis revealed that calpains were required for LL-37-mediated Bax translocation to mitochondria. Together, these data show that LL-37-induced apoptosis is mediated via the mitochondria-associated pathway in a caspase-independent and calpain- and AIF-dependent manner that involves Bax activation and translocation to mitochondria.","['Mader, Jamie S', 'Mookherjee, Neeloffer', 'Hancock, Robert E W', 'Bleackley, R Chris']","['Mader JS', 'Mookherjee N', 'Hancock RE', 'Bleackley RC']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Room 463, Medical Sciences Building, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2H7. jmader@ualberta.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090512,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3DD771JO2H (ropocamptide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calpain/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transfection', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-08-0274 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0274 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 May;7(5):689-702. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-08-0274.

In this study, HA117 gene was investigated whether it could increase the drug resistance in chronic myelogenous myeloid leukemia cell line K562. METHODS: HA117 was cloned and adenovirus vectors were constructed with the HA117 gene (Adeasy-HA117). K562 cells were infected by Ad-HA117 to get the K562/Ad-HA117 cells with HA117 gene expression. The infection efficiency and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) were detected by fluorescence and flow cytometry. The expression of HA117 gene was detected by RT-PCR. The drug sensitivities of K562/Ad-HA117 cells were detected by Methyl Thiazolyl Tetrazolium (MTT) assay. RESULTS: Recombinant adenovirus vectors were constructed and a MOI of 100 is most suitable to infect K562 cells. The infected K562 cells demonstrated in vitro production of HA117 mRNA as measured by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. There were no significant changes in K562/Ad-HA117 cells growth, while the drug sensitivities of K562/Ad-HA117 cells to Vincristine, Adriamycin, Etoposide, Daunorubicin, Mitomycin and Cyclophosphamide decreased 4.44, 7.18, 3.01, 9.53, 3.48 and 3.61 times than that of uninfected K562 cells, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Expression of the novel gene HA117 could significantly increased the multi-drug resistance of K562 cells, which indicated that HA117 is a functionally relevant multidrug resistance gene.","['Guo, Yuxia', 'Zheng, Gaihuan', 'Jin, Xianqing', 'Xu, Youhua', 'Luo, Qing', 'Liu, Xiaomei', 'Zhao, Zhenzhen', 'Chen, Yong']","['Guo Y', 'Zheng G', 'Jin X', 'Xu Y', 'Luo Q', 'Liu X', 'Zhao Z', 'Chen Y']","[""The Affiliated Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, PR China. guoyuxia9955@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090512,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Substrate Specificity']",2009/05/14 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/05/14 09:00'],"['2008/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-28-63 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-28-63 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2009 May 12;28:63. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-28-63.,10.1186/1756-9966-28-63 [doi],PMC2689865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated demographic and age-specific characteristics of childhood BL (0-14 years) in the U.S. PROCEDURE: BL age-standardized incidence rates (2000 U.S. standard population), were calculated using data obtained from 12 registries in the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for cases diagnosed from 1992 to 2005. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by gender, age-group, race, ethnicity, calendar-year period, and registry. RESULTS: Of 296 cases identified, 56% were diagnosed in lymph nodes, 21% in abdominal organs, not including retroperitoneal lymph nodes, 14% were Burkitt cell leukemia, and 9% on face/head structures. The male-to-female case ratio was highest for facial/head tumors (25:1) and lowest for Burkitt cell leukemia (1.6:1). BL incidence rate was 2.5 (95% CI 2.3-2.8) cases per million person-years and was higher among boys than girls (3.9 vs. 1.1, P < 0.001) and higher among Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders than among Blacks (2.8 and 2.9 vs. 1.2, respectively, P < 0.001). By ethnicity, BL incidence was higher among non-Hispanic Whites than Hispanic Whites (3.2 vs. 2.0, P = 0.002). Age-specific incidence rate for BL peaked by age 3-5 years (3.4 cases per million), then stabilized or declined with increasing age, but it did not vary with calendar-year or registry area. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that early childhood exposures, male-sex, and White race may be risk factors for sporadic childhood BL in the United States.","['Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Biggar, Robert J', 'Bhatia, Kishor', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Devesa, Susan S']","['Mbulaiteye SM', 'Biggar RJ', 'Bhatia K', 'Linet MS', 'Devesa SS']","['Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, DCEG, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. mbulaits@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02CP31003/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP010150-08/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22047 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Sep;53(3):366-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22047.,10.1002/pbc.22047 [doi],PMC2713377,['NIHMS100042'],,,,,,"['Published 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In most studies reasons for abandonment were based on the opinion of health-care providers (HCP), very few studies have focused on the parental point-of-view. Aims of the study were to analyze the parents' reasons of abandonment and to ascertain the fate of children who abandoned treatment in a pediatric oncology centre in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted home-visits to interview families of ALL patients, diagnosed between January 2004 and August 2007, who refused or abandoned treatment. RESULTS: From January 2004 to August 2007, 159 patients were diagnosed with ALL of which 40 children (25%) refused or abandoned therapy. Thirty-seven (93%) of these children were home-visited. Reasons for abandonment were complex. Most parents mentioned several reasons. Financial and transportation difficulties were not the only, or even the main reasons, for abandonment. Belief of ALL incurability, experience of severe side effects and dissatisfaction with HCP were also important considerations. Most patients (64%) abandoned treatment during the diagnostic-evaluation or remission-induction phase. Of the 37 patients who refused or abandoned treatment, 26 (70%) children died, and 11 (30%) children were still alive, 2 of them more than 2 years after abandonment. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing treatment abandonment of childhood ALL in developing countries requires not only financial and transportation support, but also parental education, counseling and psychosocial support during therapy, improvement of quality-of-care and adequate management of side effects.","['Sitaresmi, Mei Neni', 'Mostert, Saskia', 'Schook, Romane Milia', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Sitaresmi MN', 'Mostert S', 'Schook RM', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. msitaresmi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*psychology', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Parents/psychology', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Transportation of Patients', 'Treatment Refusal/*psychology']",2009/05/13 09:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.1578 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2010 Apr;19(4):361-7. doi: 10.1002/pon.1578.,10.1002/pon.1578 [doi],,,,,['Sutaryo'],,,"['Copyright 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: GM-CSF was administered to patients during induction chemotherapy and ATRA was ingested orally on days 1 to 14. Patients undergoing a regimen with GM-CSF and ATRA were evaluated as compared with a historical control group of subjects. RESULTS: For patients enrolled in this study, the complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery rate was 61.5% as compared with 41.4% for the historical control group of subjects. The relapse rate was 38.5% and 44.8% for the study and control group of subjects, respectively. Two-year probabilities were 45.5% (study group) and 47.4% (control group) for disease-free survival and 38.5% (study group) and 36.2% (control group) for overall survival. The most frequent side effects included fever, headache, and skin lesions with pruritus and dyspnea with pulmonary congestion, similar to ATRA syndrome.

The oncogenic potential of eIF4E arises from its ability to bind the 7-methyl guanosine (m(7)G) cap on mRNAs, thereby selectively enhancing eIF4E-dependent nuclear mRNA export and translation. We tested the clinical efficacy of targeting eIF4E in M4/M5 AML patients with a physical mimic of the m(7)G cap, ribavirin. Among 11 evaluable patients there were 1 complete remission (CR), 2 partial remissions (PRs), 2 blast responses (BRs), 4 stable diseases (SDs), and 2 progressive diseases (PDs). Ribavirin-induced relocalization of nuclear eIF4E to the cytoplasm and reduction of eIF4E levels were associated with clinical response.

Extension of this paradigm across a broad spectrum of malignancies will require an efficient method to determine the molecular vulnerabilities of cancerous cells. Improvements in sequencing technology will soon enable high-throughput sequencing of entire genomes of cancer patients; however, determining the relevance of identified sequence variants will require complementary functional analyses. Here, we report an RNAi-assisted protein target identification (RAPID) technology that individually assesses targeting of each member of the tyrosine kinase gene family. We demonstrate that RAPID screening of primary leukemia cells from 30 patients identifies targets that are critical to survival of the malignant cells from 10 of these individuals. We identify known, activating mutations in JAK2 and K-RAS, as well as patient-specific sensitivity to down-regulation of FLT1, CSF1R, PDGFR, ROR1, EPHA4/5, JAK1/3, LMTK3, LYN, FYN, PTK2B, and N-RAS. We also describe a previously undescribed, somatic, activating mutation in the thrombopoietin receptor that is sensitive to down-stream pharmacologic inhibition. Hence, the RAPID technique can quickly identify molecular vulnerabilities in malignant cells. Combination of this technique with whole-genome sequencing will represent an ideal tool for oncogenic target identification such that specific therapies can be matched with individual patients.","['Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Loriaux, Marc M', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Gotlib, Jason R', 'Willis, Stephanie G', 'Erickson, Heidi', 'Kovacsovics, Tibor', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Tyner JW', 'Deininger MW', 'Loriaux MM', 'Chang BH', 'Gotlib JR', 'Willis SG', 'Erickson H', 'Kovacsovics T', ""O'Hare T"", 'Heinrich MC', 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR000128/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', '5 P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024140/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA069533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090511,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Mutation/genetics', '*RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']","['0903233106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0903233106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 May 26;106(21):8695-700. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0903233106.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the pattern of LBL relapses after current non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) frontline therapy between April 1990 and March 2003. Relapse therapy was according to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -Relapse-BFM protocols or ALL-BFM protocols for high-risk patients. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (11%) of 251 registered patients with precursor T-cell LBL (T-LBL) and six (8%) of 73 patients with precursor B-cell LBL (pB-LBL) suffered from relapse. Of the 28 patients with T-LBL, one died from infection during relapse chemotherapy, 18 failed to achieve stable remission and died from disease progression, and nine reached allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT). Two of these nine patients who underwent SCT died from transplantation-associated toxicity, three died from disease progression, and four are still alive. These four patients are in second remission of their lymphoma for 48, 68, 125, and 131 months, respectively, after allogeneic SCT. One of the four patients developed colon adenocarcinoma 47 months after SCT. Of the six patients with pB-LBL who experienced relapse, one patient died as a result of toxicity of relapse chemotherapy, two died from disease progression after chemotherapy, and three received allogeneic SCT. Of these, two died from subsequent disease progression, and one is still alive 57 months after allogeneic SCT. CONCLUSION: Using modern conventional therapy in the frontline treatment of LBL, 10% of patients suffer from progressive disease or relapse. Because of the extremely poor reinduction success, the salvage rate for these patients is poor, with only a 14% (SE = 6%) overall survival. Long-term survival was only achieved in those few patients who were able to undergo an allogeneic SCT.","['Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Landmann, Eva', 'Lang, Peter', 'Lassay, Lisa', 'Dickerhoff, Roswitha', 'Lakomek, Max', 'Henze, Gunter', 'von Stackelberg, Arend']","['Burkhardt B', 'Reiter A', 'Landmann E', 'Lang P', 'Lassay L', 'Dickerhoff R', 'Lakomek M', 'Henze G', 'von Stackelberg A']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Giessen, Germany. birgit.burkhardt@uk-sh.de""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090511,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Switzerland', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.3367 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.3367 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Jul 10;27(20):3363-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.3367.

Exposure of cells to stress causes inhibition of Mcl-1 mRNA translation and rapid destruction of Mcl-1 protein by proteasomal degradation mediated by a phosphodegron created by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylation of Mcl-1. Here we demonstrate that prior phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is essential for Mcl-1 phosphorylation by GSK3. Stress-induced Mcl-1 degradation therefore requires the coordinated activity of JNK and GSK3.

Activation of CAR can protect the liver against bile acid-induced toxicity and it may have a role in cell death via apoptosis by altering expression of Bcl-2 family proteins such as myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Our aim was to determine if activation of CAR reduces hepatocellular apoptosis during cholestasis as a mechanism of hepatoprotection. CAR(+/+) (WT) and CAR(-/-) (CAR-null) mice were pre-treated with compounds known to activate CAR prior to induction of intrahepatic cholestasis using the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA). Pre-treatment with the CAR activators phenobarbital (PB) and TCPOBOP (TC), as well as the non-CAR activator pregnenolone 16alpha-carbontrile (PCN), protected against LCA-induced liver injury in WT mice, whereas liver injury was more extensive without CAR (CAR-null). Unexpectedly, expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) was not increased in hepatoprotected mice. Compared to unprotected groups, apoptosis was decreased in hepatoprotected mice as evidenced by the absence of cleaved caspase 3 (cCasp3). In contrast to the cytoplasmic localization in the injured livers (LCA and oltipraz), Mcl-1 protein was localized in the nucleus of hepatoprotected livers to potentially promote cell survival. This study demonstrates that although apoptosis is reduced in hepatoprotected mice pre-treated with CAR and non-CAR activators; hepatoprotection is not directly a result of CAR-induced Mcl-1 expression.","['Beilke, Lisa D', 'Aleksunes, Lauren M', 'Olson, Erik R', 'Besselsen, David G', 'Klaassen, Curtis D', 'Dvorak, Katerina', 'Cherrington, Nathan J']","['Beilke LD', 'Aleksunes LM', 'Olson ER', 'Besselsen DG', 'Klaassen CD', 'Dvorak K', 'Cherrington NJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['K22 ES011646-01A1/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK068039/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068039/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K22 ES011646/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068039-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES011646/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090320,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Constitutive Androstane Receptor)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Thiones)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1434-54-4 (Pregnenolone Carbonitrile)', '5QU0I8393U (Lithocholic Acid)', '6N510JUL1Y (oltipraz)', '76150-91-9 (1,4-bis(2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy))benzene)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cholestasis, Intrahepatic/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Constitutive Androstane Receptor', 'Cytoprotection', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Lithocholic Acid', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phenobarbital/*pharmacology', 'Pregnenolone Carbonitrile/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Thiones', 'Thiophenes', 'Transcription Factors/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0378-4274(09)00150-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2009 Jul 10;188(1):38-44. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.03.005.

We report on a series of 6 patients from 2 tertiary pediatric hospitals that had intravascular segments of long-term central venous lines that could not be removed and so were left in situ. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multiinstitutional review of long-term central venous lines (Broviacs, Port-A-Caths, and Hickmans) removed in the operating room with a focused chart review and prospective follow-up of those patients that had a failed attempt at removal. RESULTS: A total of 299 central venous lines were removed with 6 patients identified as having fragments of lines left behind (2%). The lines had been in place for an average of 37 +/- 12 months. The average follow-up period is now 5.4 +/- 3.9 years; none of the patients have developed any symptoms, evidence of thrombus, infection, or catheter migration. CONCLUSION: Given the 2% incidence rate, the issue of managing a stuck long-term central venous line will face most individuals who place these lines. We have demonstrated that simply ligating the catheter and leaving the fragment in place appears to be a safe option with minimal risk to the patient.","['Milbrandt, Kris', 'Beaudry, Paul', 'Anderson, Ron', 'Jones, Sarah', 'Giacomantonio, Mike', 'Sigalet, David']","['Milbrandt K', 'Beaudry P', 'Anderson R', 'Jones S', 'Giacomantonio M', 'Sigalet D']","[""Division of Paediatric General Surgery, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",,United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Calcinosis/etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cicatrix/etiology', 'Device Removal', 'Equipment Failure', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Foreign Bodies/epidemiology/*etiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Jugular Veins', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Subclavian Vein']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3468(09)00048-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.01.033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2009 May;44(5):972-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.01.033.,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.01.033 [doi],,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the anticancer mechanism of GA is not clearly understood. Here we showed that GA could cause growth inhibition, induce the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 cells. Since steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), overexpressed in many human malignancies including leukemia, is a central target for cancer therapy, we also explored the effects of GA on SRC-3 and SRC-3-regulated gene products in K562. GA treatment downregulated the expression of SRC-3 and then inhibited the activity of Akt kinase and its downstream targets p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) without changes in total protein levels of these three proteins, which thus influenced the expression of the apoptosis related gene Bcl-2 in K562 cells.

The tachykinins have shown immuno-regulatory activities in humans. In the present study, we investigated the effects of h HK-1 and h HK-1(4-11) on the proliferation and differentiation of a human promyelocyte leukemia cell line, HL-60. It is noteworthy that h HK-1 (1-300muM) displayed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effect of suppressing proliferation induced by these peptides was accompanied by an accumulation of cell cycle in the S phase. Moreover, this peptide induced differentiation of HL-60 cells by significantly increasing the NBT-reduction activity. The effects induced by h HK-1(4-11) on HL-60 cells were similar to that of h HK-1, indicating that it is the active fragment of h HK-1. However these effects induced by h HK-1 or h HK-1(4-11) were not antagonized by the NK(1) receptor antagonist SR140333 or the NK(2) receptor antagonist SR48968. All the results indicated that h HK-1 and h HK-1(4-11) were able to significantly inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation and S phase arrest of a human promyelocyte leukemia cell line HL-60, which may not be mediated through the activation of classical tachykinin NK(1) receptors and tachykinin NK(2) receptors.

Type I (alpha/beta) and type II (gamma) IFNs are widely administered as adjuvant therapy. We show here that both classes of IFNs upregulate CD80 mRNA and protein in primary monocytes ex vivo. The stimulatory action of IFN-alpha/beta on CD80 is accompanied by the activation of both interferon regulatory factors IRF-1 and IRF-7, whereas IFN-gamma stimulating effect is associated only with IRF-1 induction. IFNs concomitantly upregulate the transcription of CD40 costimulatory molecule whose activation is known to require IRF-1. In monocytic U937 cells, IRF-1 is activated by IFN-gamma but not by IFN-alpha/beta, whereas it is the reverse for IRF-7; in the latter cells, only IFN-gamma is capable of stimulating CD80 transcription emphasizing the essential role of IRF-1. Moreover, siRNA against IRF-1 prevents IFN-gamma-mediated CD80 activation. In AML cells, IFNs upregulate CD40, CD80 and IRF-1 in the FAB-M4/M5 subtypes but not in the less differentiated M1/M2 subtypes. Monitoring the expression of CD80 on AML cells and its modulation by IFNs could help to predict the patients more susceptible to benefit from therapeutic strategies aimed at eliciting specific T cell responses to leukemia-associated antigens.","['Bauvois, B', 'Nguyen, J', 'Tang, R', 'Billard, C', 'Kolb, J-P']","['Bauvois B', 'Nguyen J', 'Tang R', 'Billard C', 'Kolb JP']","['INSERM, U872, Paris F-75006, France. brigitte.bauvois@crc.jussieu.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090509,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/*physiology', 'Interferon Type I/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation/*physiology']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/07/15 09:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00371-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Sep 1;78(5):514-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.05.005.

The nucleic acid distribution pattern of cells in general, in terms of degree of condensation of the nuclear chromatin and overall spread of the nucleic acid within the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, can reflect the metabolic state of the cell. This simple but logical concept appears not be put into consideration to date as numerous attempts are being made towards formulating reliable biomarkers for rapid diagnosis, prognosis and subsequent therapeutic interventions for neoplastic conditions. We comparatively evaluated nucleic acid distribution patterns of normal lymphocytes and neoplastic cells of lymphocytic lineage, employing light and fluorescence microscopy procedures, as well as digital imaging analytical methods. RESULTS: The results demonstrate distinctiveness in the pattern of nucleic acid distribution for the normal lymphocytes and three lymphocytic neoplastic cell-types of canine lymphocytic leukemia that are categorized as small, intermediate and large neoplastic lymphocytes. Variably-shaped cytoplasmic processes laden with single-stranded nucleic acids (SSNA) were observed for the small and intermediate-sized neoplastic lymphocytes, compared with large neoplastic lymphocytes and the normal lymphocytes; the latter two categories of cells being virtually devoid of similar processes. Prominent cytoplasmic and nuclear clumps of SSNA, indicative of a higher rate of metabolic activity, were also observed within the neoplastic cells compared with fewer and narrower SSNA of the normal cells. CONCLUSION: The comparative relative increases of SSNA in cytoplasmic processes and other cellular areas of small and intermediate-sized neoplastic lymphocytes is reflective of greater metabolic activity in neoplastic cells in general compared with their normal cellular counterparts.","['Isitor, Godwin N', 'Campbell, Mervyn', 'Nayak, Shivananda B']","['Isitor GN', 'Campbell M', 'Nayak SB']","['Department of Preclinical Science, School of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of The West Indies, St Augustine Campus, Trinidad, WI, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. isitorgn@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090511,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2009/05/13 09:00,2009/05/13 09:01,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/13 09:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-9-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-9-13 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2009 May 11;9:13. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-9-13.,10.1186/1475-2867-9-13 [doi],PMC2694150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, genetic variants of BLM and proteins that form complexes with BLM, such as TOP3A and RMI1, might affect cancer risk as well. METHODS: In this study we have studied 26 tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in RMI1, TOP3A, and BLM and their associations with cancer risk in acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplatic syndromes (AML/MDS; N = 152), malignant melanoma (N = 170), and bladder cancer (N = 61). Two population-based control groups were used (N = 119 and N = 156). RESULTS: Based on consistency in effect estimates for the three cancer forms and similar allelic frequencies of the variant alleles in the control groups, two SNPs in TOP3A (rs1563634 and rs12945597) and two SNPs in BLM (rs401549 and rs2532105) were selected for analysis in breast cancer cases (N = 200) and a control group recruited from spouses of cancer patients (N = 131). The rs12945597 in TOP3A and rs2532105 in BLM showed increased risk for breast cancer. We then combined all cases (N = 584) and controls (N = 406) respectively and found significantly increased risk for variant carriers of rs1563634 A/G (AG carriers OR = 1.7 [95%CI 1.1-2.6], AA carriers OR = 1.8 [1.2-2.8]), rs12945597 G/A (GA carriers OR = 1.5 [1.1-1.9], AA carriers OR = 1.6 [1.0-2.5]), and rs2532105 C/T (CT+TT carriers OR = 1.8 [1.4-2.5]). Gene-gene interaction analysis suggested an additive effect of carrying more than one risk allele. For the variants of TOP3A, the risk increment was more pronounced for older carriers.

In the present study, we investigated the possible contribution of dysfunction of Bcl11b, a zinc-finger protein required for thymocyte differentiation, and of H2AX, a histone protein involved in DNA repair, to the transition from CML CP to BC. For this purpose, we crossed CML CP-exhibiting p210BCR/ABL transgenic (BA(tg/-)) mice with Bcl11b heterozygous (Bcl11b(+/-)) mice and H2AX heterozygous (H2AX(+/-)) mice. Interestingly, p210BCR/ABL transgenic, Bcl11b heterozygous (BA(tg/-)Bcl11b(+/-)) mice and p210BCR/ABL transgenic, H2AX heterozygous (BA(tg/-)H2AX(+/-)) mice frequently developed CML BC with T-cell phenotype and died in a short period. In addition, whereas p210BCR/ABL was expressed in all of the leukemic tissues, the expression of Bcl11b and H2AX was undetectable in several tumors, which was attributed to the loss of the residual normal allele or the lack of mRNA expression. These results indicate that Bcl11b and H2AX function as tumor suppressor and that haploinsufficiency and acquired loss of these gene products cooperate with p210BCR/ABL to develop CML BC.","['Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Miyazaki, Kazuko', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Miyazaki, Masaki', 'Honda, Zen-Ichiro', 'Kominami, Ryo', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Honda, Hiroaki']","['Nagamachi A', 'Yamasaki N', 'Miyazaki K', 'Oda H', 'Miyazaki M', 'Honda Z', 'Kominami R', 'Inaba T', 'Honda H']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090421,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Bcl11b protein, mouse)', '0 (H2AX protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/13 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/05/13 09:00'],"['2009/05/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1172 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01172.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Jul;100(7):1219-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01172.x.

By virtual screening of the MMS (Molecular Modeling Section) database, we have now identified quinalizarin (1,2,5,8-tetrahydroxyanthraquinone) as an inhibitor of CK2 that is more potent and selective than emodin. CK2 inhibition by quinalizarin is competitive with respect to ATP, with a Ki value of approx. 50 nM. Tested at 1 microM concentration on a panel of 75 protein kinases, quinalizarin drastically inhibits only CK2, with a promiscuity score (11.1), which is the lowest ever reported so far for a CK2 inhibitor. Especially remarkable is the ability of quinalizarin to discriminate between CK2 and a number of kinases, notably DYRK1a (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase), PIM (provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus) 1, 2 and 3, HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2), MNK1 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-interacting kinase 1], ERK8 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 8) and PKD1 (protein kinase D 1), which conversely tend to be inhibited as drastically as CK2 by commercially available CK2 inhibitors. The determination of the crystal structure of a complex between quinalizarin and CK2alpha subunit highlights the relevance of polar interactions in stabilizing the binding, an unusual characteristic for a CK2 inhibitor, and disclose other structural features which may account for the narrow selectivity of this compound. Tested on Jurkat cells, quinalizarin proved able to inhibit endogenous CK2 and to induce apoptosis more efficiently than the commonly used CK2 inhibitors TBB (4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole) and DMAT (2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole).","['Cozza, Giorgio', 'Mazzorana, Marco', 'Papinutto, Elena', 'Bain, Jenny', 'Elliott, Matthew', 'di Maira, Giovanni', 'Gianoncelli, Alessandra', 'Pagano, Mario A', 'Sarno, Stefania', 'Ruzzene, Maria', 'Battistutta, Roberto', 'Meggio, Flavio', 'Moro, Stefano', 'Zagotto, Giuseppe', 'Pinna, Lorenzo A']","['Cozza G', 'Mazzorana M', 'Papinutto E', 'Bain J', 'Elliott M', 'di Maira G', 'Gianoncelli A', 'Pagano MA', 'Sarno S', 'Ruzzene M', 'Battistutta R', 'Meggio F', 'Moro S', 'Zagotto G', 'Pinna LA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and CNR Institute of Neurosciences, University of Padova, viale G.

Data showed that B7-2 expression in chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia patients is significantly lower than in normal people, which suggests defective B7-2 expression may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia. Further, we confirmed interferon-gamma could induce B7-2 expression slightly and promote T-cell response against chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia cells, indicating interferon-gamma has clinical value in chronic leukemia immunotherapy based on modulating B7-2 expression.","['Dai, Zhen-sheng', 'Chen, Qin-fen', 'Lu, Hong-zhou', 'Xie, Yi']","['Dai ZS', 'Chen QF', 'Lu HZ', 'Xie Y']","[""Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center affiliated to Fudan University, Jinshan District, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. zhenshengdai@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090509,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen/*analysis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/10 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-009-0320-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Jun;89(5):656-63. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0320-7.

However, the mechanism of P2X7-mediated cytotoxicity remains largely unexplored. In our previous study, the lack of P2X7-mediated calcium response under normal conditions was found in P2X7(+) hematopoietic cell lines. In this study, the P2X7-mediated cytotoxicity in different type of cells (P2X7(-), P2X7(+) with calcium response, and P2X7(+) without calcium response) was investigated. Our results showed that P2X7 agonists, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) or 2',3'-O-(4 benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP, dose-dependently reduced the cell viability in all P2X7(+) cells tested, including J6-1, LCL, and Namalva cells which are negative for P2X7-mediated calcium response, although these effects were lower than those observed in KG1a cells which has normal P2X7 functions. The cytotoxic effect could be blocked by P2X7 antagonists, oxidized ATP and 1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine. In addition, externalization of phosphatidylserine could be detected in a time-dependent manner and apoptotic morphological changes could be observed after the activation of P2X7 receptor in J6-1 cells. Furthermore, P2X7-mediated pore formation could be detected in KG1a and J6-1 cells under low-ionic conditions, but not under low-divalent conditions. These effects could not be observed in P2X7(-) Ramos cells. These results suggested that P2X7 receptor-mediated cytotoxic effects may occur independent of calcium response.","['Zhang, Xiujun', 'Meng, Lijun', 'He, Baoling', 'Chen, Jing', 'Liu, Peng', 'Zhao, Jie', 'Zhang, Yufen', 'Li, Ming', 'An, Dong']","['Zhang X', 'Meng L', 'He B', 'Chen J', 'Liu P', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang Y', 'Li M', 'An D']","['Department of Life Sciences, North China Coal Medical University, Tangshan, China. zhangxiujun66@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Benzoxazoles)', '0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Quinolinium Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '152068-09-2 (YO-PRO 1)', ""4P5DXU1F8Q (3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphate)"", ""54970-91-1 (2',3'-dialdehyde ATP)"", '63HM46XPOW (KN 62)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoxazoles/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Quinolinium Compounds/pharmacokinetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Time Factors']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/19 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1093/abbs/gmp016 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2009 May;41(5):362-9. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmp016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of IRF-5 results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL6 and IL12p40, as well as type I interferons. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we identify a G202C (position relative to translation start codon) missense-mutation transcript of IRF-5 in transformed B and T cell lines, which were either infected or non-infected by viruses, and peripheral blood from ATL or CLL patients. The mutated transcript encodes a novel protein in which the sixty-eighth amino acid, Alanine, is substituted by Proline (IRF-5P68) in the DNA binding domain of IRF-5. IRF-5P68 phenotype results in a complete loss of its DNA-binding activity and functions as a dominant negative molecule through interacting with wild type IRF-5. Co-expression of IRF-5P68 inhibits MyD88-mediated IRF-5 transactivation. Moreover, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent IL6 and IL12P40 production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), R837 or CpG ODN 1826 was reduced in IRF-5 (P68) expressing cells as compared to the control cells. CONCLUSION: IRF-5P68 acts as a dominant negative regulator that interferes with IRF-5-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The functional characterization of the novel IRF-5 mutant in transformed B and T cell lines and in ATL and CLL patients may lead to a better understanding of the role of these transcriptional regulators in hematopoietic malignancies.","['Yang, Long', 'Zhao, Tiejun', 'Shi, Xiaoliu', 'Nakhaei, Peyman', 'Wang, Yunling', 'Sun, Qiang', 'Hiscott, John', 'Lin, Rongtuan']","['Yang L', 'Zhao T', 'Shi X', 'Nakhaei P', 'Wang Y', 'Sun Q', 'Hiscott J', 'Lin R']","['Terry Fox Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090511,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (IRF5 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Irf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005500 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(5):e5500. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005500.

The anti-viral agent ribavirin and the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA) are potent inhibitors of IMPDH. We recently showed that IMPDH inhibition led to a necrotic signal requiring the activation of Cdc42. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Herein, we strengthened the essential role played by this small GTPase in the necrotic signal by silencing Cdc42 and by the ectopic expression of a constitutive active mutant of Cdc42. Since resistance to apoptosis is an essential step for the tumorigenesis process, we next examined the effect of the MPA-mediated necrotic signal on different tumor cells demonstrating various mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis (Bcl2-, HSP70-, Lyn-, BCR-ABL-overexpressing cells). All tested cells remained sensitive to MPA-mediated necrotic signal. Furthermore, inhibition of IMPDH activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cells was significantly more efficient at eliminating malignant cells than apoptotic inducers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that necrosis and apoptosis are split signals that share few if any common hub of signaling. In addition, the necrotic signaling pathway induced by depletion of the cellular amount of GTP/GDP would be of great interest to eliminate apoptotic-resistant tumor cells.","['Guidicelli, Gwendaline', 'Chaigne-Delalande, Benjamin', 'Dilhuydy, Marie-Sarah', 'Pinson, Benoit', 'Mahfouf, Walid', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Pourquier, Philippe', 'Moreau, Jean-Francois', 'Legembre, Patrick']","['Guidicelli G', 'Chaigne-Delalande B', 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Pinson B', 'Mahfouf W', 'Pasquet JM', 'Mahon FX', 'Pourquier P', 'Moreau JF', 'Legembre P']","['CNRS UMR 5164, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090511,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Necrosis/chemically induced', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0005493 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(5):e5493. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005493.

The biological meaning of H3K4me is interpreted by conserved modules including plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers that recognize varied H3K4me states. The dysregulation of PHD fingers has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancers and immune or neurological disorders. Here we report that fusing an H3K4-trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the carboxy-terminal PHD finger of PHF23 or JARID1A (also known as KDM5A or RBBP2), to a common fusion partner nucleoporin-98 (NUP98) as identified in human leukaemias, generated potent oncoproteins that arrested haematopoietic differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukaemia in murine models. In these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2 marks was essential for leukaemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukaemic transformation. NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors (Hox(s), Gata3, Meis1, Eya1 and Pbx1), and enforced their active gene transcription in murine haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as 'chromatin boundary factors', dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to 'lock' developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3 with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukaemia stem cells. Collectively, our studies represent, to our knowledge, the first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an 'effector' of specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on developmentally critical loci, catastrophizes cellular fate decision-making, and even causes oncogenesis during mammalian development.","['Wang, Gang G', 'Song, Jikui', 'Wang, Zhanxin', 'Dormann, Holger L', 'Casadio, Fabio', 'Li, Haitao', 'Luo, Jun-Li', 'Patel, Dinshaw J', 'Allis, C David']","['Wang GG', 'Song J', 'Wang Z', 'Dormann HL', 'Casadio F', 'Li H', 'Luo JL', 'Patel DJ', 'Allis CD']","['Laboratory of Chromatin Biology & Epigenetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['K99 CA151683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM053512/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM053512-30/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM5A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.27 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 2)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 2', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['nature08036 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08036 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Jun 11;459(7248):847-51. doi: 10.1038/nature08036.,10.1038/nature08036 [doi],PMC2697266,['NIHMS107550'],,,,,,,"['PDB/2KGG', 'PDB/2KGI', 'PDB/3GL6']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We redefined and updated a cohort of male workers employed in industrial facilities where EO was produced or used. All 2063 men were employed between 1940 and the end of 1988 and were observed for mortality through 2003. Cause specific Standardized Mortality Ratios were calculated. Internal analyses were made by applying Cox proportional hazards models to the data. RESULTS: No indications were found for excess cancer risks from EO exposures, including the lymphohematopoietic malignancies. There were 11 leukemia deaths and 11.8 expected and 12 non-Hodgkin lymphoma deaths and 11.5 expected. Proportional hazards modeling for all cause, leukemia and lymphoid malignancies mortality revealed no trends or associations with cumulative exposure. CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively high EO exposures in the past and extensive mortality follow-up, the cause specific mortality rates are comparable with those of the general US population. The Standardized Mortality Ratio analyses and the proportional hazards modeling for all cause mortality, leukemia and lymphoid malignancies mortality do not indicate exposure related effects in this cohort.","['Swaen, Gerard M H', 'Burns, Carol', 'Teta, Jane M', 'Bodner, Kenneth', 'Keenan, Dave', 'Bodnar, Catherine M']","['Swaen GM', 'Burns C', 'Teta JM', 'Bodner K', 'Keenan D', 'Bodnar CM']","['Department of Epidemiology, Health Services, The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich, USA. gswaen@dow.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,['JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)'],IM,"['*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethylene Oxide/*poisoning', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/24 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181a2ca20 [doi]'],ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2009 Jun;51(6):714-23. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181a2ca20.,10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181a2ca20 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three novel genes demonstrated frequent methylation in childhood ALL. PPP2R3A (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B"", alpha) was frequently methylated in T (69%) and B (82%)-ALL. Whilst FBLN2 (fibulin 2) and THRB (thyroid hormone receptor, beta) showed frequent methylation in B-ALL (58%; 56% respectively), but were less frequently methylated in T-ALL (17% for both genes). Recently it was demonstrated that BNC1 (Basonuclin 1) and MSX1 (msh homeobox 1) were frequently methylated across common epithelial cancers. In our series of childhood ALL BNC1 was frequently methylated in both T (77%) and B-ALL (79%), whilst MSX1 showed T-ALL (25%) specific methylation. The methylation of the above five genes was cancer specific and expression of the genes could be restored in methylated leukemia cell lines treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

The transformation of infected CD4 T cells and the pathogenesis of leukemia have been studied with great limitation in tissue culture and patients. To better understand the pathogenesis and perform preclinical drug studies, animal models of ATL are urgently needed. In mice, inoculation of HTLV-1 cell lines mostly leads to development of localized lymphomas. To develop an ATL animal model with leukemic spread of ATL cells, mouse strains with different well-defined immune deficiencies were inoculated intraperitoneally with different HTLV-1-infected cell lines (ACH.2, C8166, MT-2, MET-1). Inoculation of MET-1 cells into NOD/SCID mice provided the best model system for slowly developing T-cell leukemia with multiple organ involvement. In leukemic mice, an increase in serum calcium levels correlated with expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ligand on leukemic cells and secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein and interleukin-6. In contrast to the other cell lines that did not spread systemically, MET-1 expressed both the adhesion molecules CD11a (LFA-1alpha) and CD49d (VLA-4alpha) and produced or induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases 1, 2, 3, and 9, thus underlining the importance of these molecules in the spread of adult T-cell leukemia cells.

While signal transduction by agonist-bound chemokine receptors plays a central role in the above responses, it is unclear how it contributes to the sustained and concurrent nature of such responses, given the rapid kinetics of chemokine-induced trimeric G protein coupling and homologous desensitization. Our findings unveil a novel role of beta-arrestins in regulating the activation of signaling pathways underlying discrete integrin-mediated steps in CXCR2-driven leukocyte extravasation. By combining in vivo approaches in beta-arrestin knockout mice with in vitro studies in engineered cellular models, we show that membrane-recruited beta-arrestin 2 is required for the onset and maintenance of shear stress-resistant leukocyte adhesion mediated by both beta(1) and beta(2) integrins. While both beta-arrestin isoforms are required for rapid keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC)-induced arrest onto limiting amounts of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), adhesion strengthening under shear is selectively dependent on beta-arrestin 2. The latter synergizes with phospholipase C in promoting activation of Rap1A and B, both of which co-operatively control subsecond adhesion as well as postarrest adhesion stabilization. Thus, receptor-induced Galpha(i) and beta-arrestins act sequentially and in spatially distinct compartments to promote optimal KC-induced integrin-dependent adhesion during leukocyte extravasation.","['Molteni, Raffaella', 'Crespo, Carolina Lage', 'Feigelson, Sara', 'Moser, Christian', 'Fabbri, Monica', 'Grabovsky, Valentin', 'Krombach, Fritz', 'Laudanna, Carlo', 'Alon, Ronen', 'Pardi, Ruggero']","['Molteni R', 'Crespo CL', 'Feigelson S', 'Moser C', 'Fabbri M', 'Grabovsky V', 'Krombach F', 'Laudanna C', 'Alon R', 'Pardi R']","['San Raffaele University School of Medicine, 20132 Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090508,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arrb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Arrb2 protein, rat)', '0 (Arrestins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (beta-Arrestin 2)', '0 (beta-Arrestins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arrestins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/physiology', 'Keratinocytes/physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocyte Rolling/*physiology', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Shear Strength', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Venules', 'beta-Arrestin 2', 'beta-Arrestins']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42180-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-183699 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jul 30;114(5):1073-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-183699.

We measured the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) content of normal neutrophils and neutrophils with toxic granulation by flow cytometry after incubating them with bis(Zn(2+)-dipicolylamine) complex. A total of 122 blood samples (78 with neutrophils with toxic granulation, 44 with normal neutrophils without toxic granulation) were analyzed. The mean autofluorescence levels of neutrophils in the toxic granulation (+) group and toxic granulation (-) group were both 1.9 x 10(3) MESF (mean equivalent soluble fluorochrome) values. However, after incubating neutrophils with bis(Zn(2+)-dipicolylamine) complex for 15 min, the mean fluorescence intensities of neutrophils in the toxic granulation (+) and toxic granulation (-) groups were significantly enhanced by 71- and 19-fold to 138+/-78 x 10(3) MESF and 37+/-37 x 10(3) MESF, respectively (p <0.001). An MESF cutoff value of 79 x 10(3) showed a sensitivity of 93.2% and a specificity of 81.8% for neutrophils with toxic granulation. Similarly, the MESF level ratio, defined as the ratio of the MESF value after incubation with bis(Zn(2+)-dipicolylamine) complex to the autofluorescence MESF value, at a cutoff value of 41, showed a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 81.8% for the detection of neutrophils with toxic granulation. The MESF values of neutrophils after incubation with bis(Zn(2+)-dipicolylamine) complex did not correlate with the leukocyte (p >0.05) or neutrophil counts (p >0.05).

The cardiotonic steroid bufalin enhances vitamin D-induced differentiation of leukemia cells and VDR transactivation activity. In this study, we examined the combined effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and bufalin on differentiation and VDR target gene expression in human leukemia cells. Bufalin in combination with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhanced the expression of VDR target genes, such as CYP24A1 and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, and effectively induced differentiation phenotypes. An inhibitor of the Erk mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway partially inhibited bufalin induction of VDR target gene expression. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment induced transient nuclear expression of VDR in HL60 cells. Interestingly, bufalin enhanced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced nuclear VDR expression. The MAP kinase pathway inhibitor increased nuclear VDR expression induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and did not change that by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) plus bufalin. A proteasome inhibitor also enhanced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced CYP24A1 expression and nuclear VDR expression. Bufalin-induced nuclear VDR expression was associated with histone acetylation and VDR recruitment to the CYP24A1 promoter in HL60 cells. Thus, the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor bufalin modulates VDR function through several mechanisms, including Erk MAP kinase activation and increased nuclear VDR expression.","['Amano, Yusuke', 'Cho, Yoshitake', 'Matsunawa, Manabu', 'Komiyama, Kazuo', 'Makishima, Makoto']","['Amano Y', 'Cho Y', 'Matsunawa M', 'Komiyama K', 'Makishima M']","['Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090206,England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Cardiac Glycosides)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (CYP24A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Cardiac Glycosides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0960-0760(09)00049-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.01.022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2009 Apr;114(3-5):144-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.01.022.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The principal aim of this investigation was to isolate and characterize the anticancer compound from the kernel of Semecarpus anacardium nut. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bioactivity-tailored isolation and detailed chemical characterization were used to identify the active compound. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest as well as synergism between the identified anticancer compound and doxorubicin in human tumor cell lines were analyzed. RESULTS: GC/MS, IR, proton NMR, carbon NMR and collisionally induced dissociation (CID) spectra analysis showed that the isolated active compound is 3-(8'(Z),11'(Z)-pentadecadienyl) catechol (SA-3C). SA-3C is cytotoxic to tumor cell lines with IC(50) values lower than doxorubicin and even multidrug resistant tumor cell lines were equally sensitive to SA-3C. SA-3C induced apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and showed synergistic cytotoxicity with doxorubicin. The cell cycle arrest induced by SA-3C at S- and G(2)/M-phases correlated with inhibition of checkpoint kinases.

We used two kinds of polyethyleneglycol-lipids which are 1-monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-distearoylglycerol (PEG-DSG) with an alkyl anchor and cholesterol-PEG (PEG-CHO) with a cholesterol anchor. Hy-LDOX was evaluated on antitumor activity (in vivo), DOX uptake into tumor cells, and DOX cytotoxicity (in vitro). Both tumor size and tumor weight in the Hy-LDOX group were decreased, compared with those in the control group. Hy-LDOX had increased DOX uptake into P388 leukemia cells, compared with the single PEG-DSG modified liposomes. Moreover, the IC(50) value, used as the index of the effect of cytotoxicity, significantly decreased in Hy-LDOX. We suggested that these results of DOX uptake and cytotoxicity contributed to PEG-CHO on liposomal membrane. The PEG modified liposome with only PEG-CHO cannot have a prolonged circulation time, but the Hy-LDOX which was modified with mixing PEG-lipids (PEG-DSG and PEG-CHO) showed stability in blood and incorporation in tumor cells. As the result of these experiments, Hy-LDOX were observed to be useful in terms of cell transition at target site, as shown by high DOX uptake into cell, and high cytotoxicity because PEG-CHO has good incorporated into tumor cell. Hence, it is expected that Hy-LDOX has novel functions.","['Sugiyama, Ikumi', 'Sonobe, Takashi', 'Sadzuka, Yasuyuki']","['Sugiyama I', 'Sonobe T', 'Sadzuka Y']","['School of Pharmacy, Iwate Medical University, 2-1-1 Nishitokuta, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan. isugiym@iwate-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090120,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Lipids/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",2009/05/12 09:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(09)00032-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2009 May 8;372(1-2):177-83. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.01.010.

However, their efficacy may not be adequate for their development as anticancer agents. In this study, we used a natural antimicrobial peptide, cecropin B (CB), as a template to generate a novel anticancer peptide. Cecropin B is an amphipathic and polycationic peptide derived from the hemolymph of Hyalophora cecropia with well-known antimicrobial and cytolytic properties. The signature pattern of cecropins is W-x-(0,2)-[KDN]-x-{L}-K-[KRE]-[LI]-E-[RKN] (PROSITE: PS00268), and this signature sequence is located at N-terminus of CB. CB1a was constructed by repeating the N-terminal ten amino acids of CB three times and including a hinge near C-terminus. The circular dichroism spectra showed that CB1a is unstructured in aqueous solution, but adopt a helical conformation in membrane-like environment. The solution structure of CB1a in a polar solvent was also studied by NMR. CB1a formed a helix-hinge-helix in 20% HFIP solution, and it was found the bent angle between two helical segments was induced ranging from 60 degrees to 110 degrees . A heparin-binding motif is located in the central part of helix 1. Isothermal titration calorimetry reveals the association constant of CB1a bound to low molecular weight heparin is 1.66 x 10(5)M(-1) at physiological ionic strength at 25 degrees C. Binding of CB1a to heparin produces a large conformational change toward a more structural state. CB1a demonstrated promising activity against several cancer cells but low toxicity against non-cancer cells. The IC(50) of CB1a on leukemia and stomach carcinoma cells were in the range of 2-8-fold lower than those of CB. Besides, CB1a exhibited low hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. Due to these properties, CB1a has the potential to become a promising anticancer agent.","['Wu, Jiun-Ming', 'Jan, Pey-Shynan', 'Yu, Hui-Chen', 'Haung, Hsu-Yuang', 'Fang, Huey-Jen', 'Chang, Yuan-I', 'Cheng, Jya-Wei', 'Chen, Hueih Min']","['Wu JM', 'Jan PS', 'Yu HC', 'Haung HY', 'Fang HJ', 'Chang YI', 'Cheng JW', 'Chen HM']","['Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090213,United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (cecropin B1 protein, insect)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calorimetry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0196-9781(09)00046-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.peptides.2009.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2009 May;30(5):839-48. doi: 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.02.004.

Such metabolites have been extensively scrutinized at the in vitro level demonstrating evident genotoxic properties. In monitoring, a diverse range of outcomes has been produced. Additionally, epidemiological studies in rubber workers face difficulties of data interpretation due to the changeability and multiple exposures of the workers as well as to confounding factors inherent to the cohorts. Nevertheless, toxicity has been associated with a significant trend of increasing the risk of leukaemia in employees at the styrene-butadiene rubber industry. Thus, further effort must be made to distinguish the exposures to each chemical over time and to characterize their interrelationships. The present investigation focuses on the effects and mechanisms of damage of the mixture styrene-butadiene by examining its metabolites: styrene oxide (SO), butadiene monoepoxide (BME) and butadiene diepoxide (BDE) respectively. The in vitro Comet assay on frozen lymphocytes has been employed to ascertain the DNA damage patterns for the styrene-butadiene metabolites combined and on their own. Different patterns were observed for the mixture and each of its components. This study has also led to determining the mechanism of damage of the mixture and the compounds. With regard to the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), co-treatment with catalase does not modulate the genotoxicity of the mixture but it does modulate its components. The outcomes also indicate that the mixture induces cross-links and this is due to the influence of BDE in the mixture, being more evident as the concentration of BDE increases. An investigation on the sensitivity of lymphocytes from occupationally un/exposed subjects to in vitro exposure of the mixture and its components revealed that occupationally exposed subjects had a substantially higher background of DNA damage and a lower sensitivity to the metabolites of styrene, 1,3-butadiene and its mixture.","['Cemeli, Eduardo', 'Mirkova, Ekaterina', 'Chiuchiarelli, Giorgia', 'Alexandrova, Elena', 'Anderson, Diana']","['Cemeli E', 'Mirkova E', 'Chiuchiarelli G', 'Alexandrova E', 'Anderson D']","['University of Bradford, Division of Biomedical Sciences, Richmond Road, Bradford, West Yorkshire BD7 1DP, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090304,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '478ERR5NKR (3,4-epoxy-1-butene)', '60OB65YNAB (diepoxybutane)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', '9QH06NGT6O (styrene oxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Butadienes/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epoxy Compounds/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Rubber', 'Styrene/administration & dosage/metabolism/*toxicity']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(09)00081-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 May 12;664(1-2):69-76. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.02.010.

However, the mechanisms underlying the long-term effects of foetal irradiation remain poorly understood. This study was designed to analyse the impact of in utero irradiation on mutation rates at expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) DNA loci in directly exposed mice and their first-generation (F(1)) offspring. ESTR mutation frequencies in the germline and somatic tissues of male and female mice irradiated at 12 days of gestation remained highly elevated during adulthood, which was mainly attributed to a significant increase in the frequency of singleton mutations. The prevalence of singleton mutations in directly exposed mice suggests that foetal irradiation results in genomic instability manifested both in utero and during adulthood. The frequency of ESTR mutation in the F(1) offspring of prenatally irradiated male mice was equally elevated across all tissues, which suggests that foetal exposure results in transgenerational genomic instability. In contrast, maternal in utero exposure did not affect the F(1) stability. Our data imply that the passive erasure of epigenetic marks in the maternal genome can diminish the transgenerational effects of foetal irradiation and therefore provide important clues to the still unknown mechanisms of radiation-induced genomic instability. The results of this study offer a plausible explanation for the effects of in utero irradiation on the risk of leukaemia and solid cancers after birth.","['Barber, Ruth C', 'Hardwick, Robert J', 'Shanks, Morag E', 'Glen, Colin D', 'Mughal, Safeer K', 'Voutounou, Mariel', 'Dubrova, Yuri E']","['Barber RC', 'Hardwick RJ', 'Shanks ME', 'Glen CD', 'Mughal SK', 'Voutounou M', 'Dubrova YE']","['Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['G0300477/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0300477/66802/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '0786607/Z/05/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090206,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA Repeat Expansion/*radiation effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability/*radiation effects', 'Germ-Line Mutation/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*genetics']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']","['S0027-5107(09)00051-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2009 May 12;664(1-2):6-12. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2009.01.011.

Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is widely used in treating human acute polymyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, solid tumors and other leukemia cells such as U937 promonocytic leukemia cells are insensitive to As(2)O(3). Esculetin, a coumarin derivative, has previously induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of HL-60 cells as well as enhanced taxol-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells, thereby displaying anticancer potential. In this study, esculetin inhibited proliferation and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation in human leukemia U937 cells. Since inhibitors of MAPKs have modulated the GSH-redox state and enhanced the sensitivity of leukemia cells to As(2)O(3)-provoked apoptosis, we monitored the effect of combining esculetin and As(2)O(3) (2.5 microM) on the GSH level. Our study showed that esculetin, PD98059 (MEK/ERK inhibitor), and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) similarly enhanced the As(2)O(3)-induced GSH depletion. We found that the As(2)O(3) (2.5 microM) treatment slightly induced apoptosis and the pretreatment of esculetin enhanced the As(2)O(3)-provoked apoptosis significantly. In addition, esculetin enhanced the effect of As(2)O(3) on caspase activation in U937 cells. We compared the combined esculetin and As(2)O(3) treatment to the As(2)O(3) treated alone. The combined esculetin and As(2)O(3) treatment increased Bid cleavage, Bax conformation change and cytochrome C release. The study also indicated that esculetin enhanced the As(2)O(3)-induced lysosomal leakage and apoptosis. Furthermore, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced these enhanced effects. Based on these studies, esculetin enhances the As(2)O(3)-provoked apoptosis by modulating the MEK/ERK and JNK pathways and reducing intracellular GSH levels. GSH depletion led to higher oxidative stress which activated lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.","['Lin, Tseng-Hsi', 'Lu, Fung-Jou', 'Yin, Yu-Fang', 'Tseng, Tsui-Hwa']","['Lin TH', 'Lu FJ', 'Yin YF', 'Tseng TH']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090129,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SM2XD6V944 (esculetin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Umbelliferones/*pharmacology']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00035-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2009 Jun 15;180(1):61-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.01.011.

Side-effects of thiopurine therapy have been correlated with thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. We propose a novel TPMT-mediated mechanism of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-specific effects on 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) induced cytotoxicity in a model cell line for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT). Our results show that exogenous SAM (10-50microM) rescues cells from the toxic effects of 6-MP (5microM) by delaying the onset of apoptosis. We prove that the extent of methylthioinosine monophosphate (MeTIMP) induced inhibition of de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) determines the concentrations of intracellular ATP, and consequently SAM, which acts as a positive modulator of TPMT activity. This leads to a greater conversion of 6-MP to inactive 6-methylmercaptopurine, and thus lower availability of thioinosine monophosphate for the biotransformation to cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) and MeTIMP. We further show that the addition of exogenous SAM to 6-MP treated cells maintains intracellular SAM levels, TPMT activity and protein levels, all of which are diminished in cells incubated with 6-MP. Since TPMT mRNA levels remained unaltered, the effect of SAM appears to be restricted to protein stabilisation rather than an increase of TPMT expression. We thus propose that SAM reverses the extent of 6-MP cytotoxicity, by acting as a TPMT-stabilizing factor. This study provides new insights into the pharmacogenetics of thiopurine drugs. Identification of SAM as critical modulator of TPMT activity and consequently thiopurine toxicity may set novel grounds for the rationalization of thiopurine therapy.","['Milek, Miha', 'Karas Kuzelicki, Natasa', 'Smid, Alenka', 'Mlinaric-Rascan, Irena']","['Milek M', 'Karas Kuzelicki N', 'Smid A', 'Mlinaric-Rascan I']","['University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090319,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*pharmacology']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00181-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jun 15;77(12):1845-53. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.006.

After being transported into leukemic cells by human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), ara-C is phosphorylated to ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), an active metabolite, and then incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) are associated with the production of ara-CTP. Because ara-C's cytotoxicity depends on ara-CTP production, parameters that are most related to ara-CTP formation would predict ara-C sensitivity and the clinical outcome of ara-C therapy. The present study focused on finding any correlation between the capacity to produce ara-CTP and ara-C-metabolizing factors. In vitro ara-CTP production, mRNA levels of hENT1, dCK, and cN-II, and ara-C sensitivity were evaluated in 34 blast samples from 33 leukemic patients including 26 with AML. A large degree of heterogeneity was seen in the capacity to produce ara-CTP and in mRNA levels of hENT1, dCK, and cN-II. Despite the lack of any association between each of the transcript levels and ara-CTP production, the ratio of dCK/cN-II transcript levels correlated significantly with the amount of ara-CTP among AML samples. The HL-60 cultured leukemia cell line and its three ara-C-resistant variants (HL-60/R1, HL-60/R2, HL-60/R3), which were 8-, 10-, and 500-fold more resistant than HL-60, respectively, were evaluated similarly. The dCK/cN-II ratio was again proportional to ara-CTP production and to ara-C sensitivity. The dCK/cN-II ratio may thus predict the capacity for ara-CTP production and ultimately, ara-C sensitivity in AML.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Negoro, Eiju', 'Kishi, Shinji', 'Takagi, Kazutaka', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Iwasaki, Hiromichi', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamauchi T', 'Negoro E', 'Kishi S', 'Takagi K', 'Yoshida A', 'Urasaki Y', 'Iwasaki H', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui, Japan. tyamauch@u-fukui.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090324,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5C2 protein, human)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*genetics"", 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00186-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jun 15;77(12):1780-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.011.

Nargenicin inhibited cell proliferation and induced HL-60 cell differentiation when administered in combination with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or ATRA. In addition, western blot analyses and kinase inhibitor studies demonstrated that nargenicin primarily enhanced leukemia cell differentiation via PKCbeta1/MAPK pathways. The results of this study indicate that nargenicin has the ability to induce differentiation and suggest that it may be useful for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.","['Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Yoo, Jin Cheol', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Kim SH', 'Yoo JC', 'Kim TS']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090314,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Lactones)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '70695-02-2 (nargenicin A1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00152-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jun 1;77(11):1694-701. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.03.004.

Assessment of remission and treatment decisions are based on cytological findings. We analyzed the prognostic impact of cytogenetic remission status in 118 patients with abnormal karyotype who received induction chemotherapy. Initial cytogenetics were: 28 good-risk (14x t(15;17), 9x t(8;21), 5x inv(16)), 44 intermediate-risk, and 46 high-risk karyotypes. Eighty-three patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 20 achieved partial remission. Twenty-six of the patients who reached cytological CR retained an abnormal karyotype after induction, 13 of whom had been classified as standard-risk and therefore did not receive intensified consolidation. Sixty-one patients achieved cytogenetic CR (CCR), including 24 out of 28 (86%) patients with low-risk cytogenetics. The CCR rate was lower in patients with intermediate-risk (48%) or poor-risk cytogenetics (28%). Median survival (excluding patients with AML M3) of the CCR group was 37 months, as compared to 11 months in patients with persistence of abnormal karyotype (p < 0.0001). This difference remained statistically significant when calculated only for patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes (p = 0.03). Cytogenetic analysis after induction chemotherapy provides meaningful information especially in patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes. Patients with a persisting abnormal karyotype must be regarded as high-risk patients who should receive intensified treatment.","['Balleisen, Sebastian', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Germing, Ulrich']","['Balleisen S', 'Kuendgen A', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Haas R', 'Germing U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20090509,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00111-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Sep;33(9):1189-93. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.03.004.

This functionality can lead to the formation of a covalent bond with the amino group of selected guanines in the DNA double helix, both in the absence and in the presence of methylated cytosines. The resulting complex is additionally stabilized by the establishment of one or more hydrogen bonds with adjacent nucleotides in the opposite strand as well as by van der Waals interactions within the minor groove. Fluorescence-based thermal denaturation experiments demonstrated that the most favorable DNA triplets for covalent adduct formation are AGG, GGC, AGC, CGG and TGG, and these preferences could be rationalized on the basis of molecular modeling results. Zalypsis-DNA adducts eventually give rise to double-strand breaks, triggering S-phase accumulation and apoptotic cell death. The potent cytotoxic activity of Zalypsis was ascertained in a 24 cell line panel. The mean IC(50) value was 7nM and leukemia and stomach tumor cell lines were amongst the most sensitive. Zalypsis administration in four murine xenograft models of human cancer demonstrates significant tumor growth inhibition that is highest in the Hs746t gastric cancer cell line with no weight loss of treated animals.

Recently, it was shown that several human multidrug resistance (MDR) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins could be modulated by specific TKIs. MDR can produce cancer chemotherapy failure, typically due to overexpression of ABC transporters, which are involved in the extrusion of therapeutic drugs. Here, we report for the first time that nilotinib potentiates the cytotoxicity of widely used therapeutic substrates of ABCG2, such as mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and ABCB1 substrates including colchicine, vincristine, and paclitaxel. Nilotinib also significantly enhances the accumulation of paclitaxel in cell lines overexpressing ABCB1. Similarly, nilotinib significantly increases the intracellular accumulation of mitoxantrone in cells transfected with ABCG2. Furthermore, nilotinib produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of the ABCG2-mediated transport of methotrexate (MTX), as well as E(2)17betaG a physiological substrate of ABCG2. Uptake studies in membrane vesicles overexpressing ABCG2 have indicated that nilotinib inhibits ABCG2 similar to other established TKIs as well as fumitremorgin C. Nilotinib is a potent competitive inhibitor of MTX transport by ABCG2 with a K(i) value of 0.69+/-0.083 microM as demonstrated by kinetic analysis of nilotinib. Overall, our results indicate that nilotinib could reverse ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR by blocking the efflux function of these transporters. These findings may be used to guide the design of present and future clinical trials with nilotinib, elucidating potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Also, these findings may be useful in clinical practice for cancer combination therapy with nilotinib.","['Tiwari, Amit K', 'Sodani, Kamlesh', 'Wang, Si-Rong', 'Kuang, Ye-Hong', 'Ashby, Charles R Jr', 'Chen, Xiang', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng']","['Tiwari AK', 'Sodani K', 'Wang SR', 'Kuang YH', 'Ashby CR Jr', 'Chen X', 'Chen ZS']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, St. John's University, 8000 Utopia Parkway, Jamaica, NY 11439, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090411,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2009/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)00261-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Jul 15;78(2):153-61. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.04.002.

To test whether the extent of protein haptenation is a determinant in DC maturation, we tested the effect of five dinitrophenyl (DNP) analogues of different reactivity, on maturation markers in the cell line, THP-1. The potencies of the test compounds in upregulating CD54 levels, inducing IL-8 release and triggering p38 MAPK phosphorylation did not correlate with their ability to deplete intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels or cause cell toxicity. However, the compounds' potency at inducing p38 phosphorylation was significantly associated with the amount of intracellular protein adducts formed (p<0.05). Inhibition experiments show that, at least for DNFB, p38 MAP kinase signalling controls compound-specific changes in CD54 expression and IL-8 release. 2D-PAGE analysis revealed that all the DNP analogues appeared to bind similar proteins. The analogues failed to activate NFkB, however, they activated Nrf2, which was used as a marker of oxidative stress. Neither GSH depletion, by use of buthionine sulfoximine, nor treatment with the strongly lysine-reactive hapten penicillin elicited maturation. We conclude that protein haptenation, probably through reactive cysteine residues may be a trigger for maturation events in this in vitro model and that p38 activation may be a discriminatory marker for the classification of potency of chemical sensitizers.","['Megherbi, Rym', 'Kiorpelidou, Evanthia', 'Foster, Brian', 'Rowe, Cliff', 'Naisbitt, Dean J', 'Goldring, Christopher E', 'Park, B Kevin']","['Megherbi R', 'Kiorpelidou E', 'Foster B', 'Rowe C', 'Naisbitt DJ', 'Goldring CE', 'Park BK']","['MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, The University of Liverpool, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, UK.']",['eng'],"['BB/E010040/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090507,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Xenobiotics)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Dermatitis, Allergic Contact/*immunology/metabolism', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Haptens/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Xenobiotics/immunology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(09)00183-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2009.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2009 Jul 15;238(2):120-32. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.05.001.

Here, we analyzed the apoptotic effect of SNX-2112 on human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells.

The human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell K562, highly expresses IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-IR, and IGF-induced cellular proliferation is mediated by IGF-IR. To characterize the impact of c-myb on the IGF-IGFBP-3 axis in leukemia cells, we overexpressed c-myb using an adenovirus gene transfer system in K562 cells. The overexpression of c-myb induced cell proliferation, compared to control, and c-myb induced cell growth was inhibited by anti-IGF-IR antibodies. c-myb overexpression resulted in a significant increase in the expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-IR, and a decrease in IGFBP-3 expression. By contrast, disruption of c-myb function by DN-myb overexpression resulted in significant reduction of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-IR, and elevation of IGFBP-3 expression. In addition, exogenous IGFBP-3 inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells, and c-myb induced cell growth was blocked by IGFBP-3 overexpression in a dose-dependent manner. The growth-promoting effects of c-myb were mediated through two major intracellular signaling pathways, Akt and Erk. Activation of Akt and Erk by c-myb was completely blocked by IGF-IR and IGFBP-3 antibodies. These findings suggest that c-myb stimulates cell growth, in part, by regulating expression of the components of IGF-IGFBP axis in K562 cells. In addition, disruption of c-myb function by DN-myb may provide a useful strategy for treatment of leukemia.","['Kim, Min-Sun', 'Kim, Sun-Young', 'Arunachalam, Sankarganesh', 'Hwang, Pyoung-Han', 'Yi, Ho-Keun', 'Nam, Sang-Yun', 'Lee, Dae-Yeol']","['Kim MS', 'Kim SY', 'Arunachalam S', 'Hwang PH', 'Yi HK', 'Nam SY', 'Lee DY']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 561-712, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090508,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/05/12 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/05/12 09:00'],"['2009/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)00910-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Jul 17;385(1):38-43. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.018.
