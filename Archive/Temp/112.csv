Molecular diagnostic laboratories face such difficulties with the BCL2-IGH translocation in follicular lymphoma and with internal tandem duplication mutation of the FLT3 gene in leukemia, where breakpoints are widely distributed, mutations may be multiple, signal strength is low, and background noise is elevated. We developed a strategy, called Delta-PCR, that ensures PCR specificity and identifies individual breakpoints. Delta-PCR uses two forward primers (external and internal) and a reverse primer simultaneously. The internal primer functions as a probe with a defined distance Delta from the external primer. For follicular lymphoma, we prepared upstream, BCL2-specific primers for potential breakpoints to pair with a common, downstream VLJH primer. Multiplexed PCR amplicons are sized by capillary electrophoresis. Each of the upstream pairs has a defined interval separating them that uniquely identifies the breakpoint. The presence of two amplicons with a defined size difference confirms validity of the rearrangement and identity of the specific breakpoint, even if signal strength is low. By testing 40 follicular lymphoma and 12 control specimens from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, we showed that multiplex Delta-PCR is a simple, sensitive strategy to identify translocations with multiple breakpoints or partners. The strategy was also applied to detect minor leukemic clones with internal tandem duplication mutations and could have broader applications for other insertion/deletion and duplication mutations.","['Copyright A(c) 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Functional evidence was obtained that AHR impacts in vivo megakaryocytic differentiation and maturation; compared to wild-type mice, AHR-null mice had lower platelet counts, fewer numbers of newly synthesized platelets, increased bleeding times and lower-ploidy megakaryocytes (Mks). AHR mRNA increased 3.6-fold during ex vivo megakaryocytic differentiation, but reduced or remained constant during parallel isogenic granulocytic or erythroid differentiation. We interrogated the role of AHR in megakaryopoiesis using a validated Mk model of megakaryopoiesis, the human megakaryoblastic leukaemia CHRF cell line. Upon CHRF Mk differentiation, AHR mRNA and protein levels increased, AHR protein shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and AHR binding to its consensus DNA binding sequence increased. Protein and mRNA levels of the AHR transcriptional target HES1 also increased. Mk differentiation of CHRF cells where AHR or HES1 was knocked-down using RNAi resulted in lower ploidy distributions and cells that were incapable of reaching ploidy classes >/=16n. AHR knockdown also resulted in increased DNA synthesis of lower ploidy cells, without impacting apoptosis. Together, these data support a role for AHR in Mk polyploidization and in vivo platelet function, and warrant further detailed investigations.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Lindsey, Stephan', 'Papoutsakis, Eleftherios T']","['Lindsey S', 'Papoutsakis ET']","['Department of Chemical Engineering and Delaware Biotechnology Institute, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19711, USA. slindsey@udel.edu']",['eng'],"['F32 HL091620/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HL091620-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32HL091620/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110112,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Platelet Count', 'Polyploidy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Thrombopoiesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3408620,2011/01/14 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08548.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Feb;152(4):469-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08548.x.

Several early- and late-phase clinical trials for chronic myelogeneous leukaemia (CML) have demonstrated the direct inhibition of BCR-ABL fusion protein and SFKs, which led to dasatinib approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Phase III dose-optimization study was performed to compare different regimens, stating that dasatinib 100 mg once daily is now the recommended schedule for patients with chronic CML, and 140 mg once daily for patients with accelerated phase or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML, and for patients with Ph+ ALL until progression. Because of the myriad of critical roles of SFKs in biological processes, SFKs inhibition could induce numerous biological responses. Ongoing clinical trials evaluate dasatinib in the treatment of several solid tumours, including gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), prostate cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, sarcomas, NSCLC, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma and other haematologic malignancies as multiple myeloma. Ongoing pre-clinical studies assess the therapeutic potential of dasatinib in other solid tumours, including melanoma, head and neck cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Dasatinib is generally well tolerated. Myelosuppression is the common adverse event which is, however, reversible by dose reduction, discontinuation, or interruption. Thrombocytopenia is more significant than neutropenia and associated to gastrointestinal bleeding and CNS haemorrhage. The most common non-haematologic adverse events include gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia), headache, peripheral edema, and pleural effusion. In respect of these encouraging studies investigating dasatinib in the treatment of patients with GIST, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma and sarcomas, ongoing phase III clinical trials warrant the drug evaluation as recommended agent for the treatment of these diseases, also in association with chemotherapy or other targeted therapies.",,"['Gnoni, Antonio', 'Marech, Ilaria', 'Silvestris, Nicola', 'Vacca, Angelo', 'Lorusso, Vito']","['Gnoni A', 'Marech I', 'Silvestris N', 'Vacca A', 'Lorusso V']","['Medical Oncology Unit, Hospital Vito Fazzi, Lecce, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2011/01/14 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00219aaa [pii]', '10.2174/138945011794751591 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2011 Apr;12(4):563-78. doi: 10.2174/138945011794751591.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity effect and DNA unwinding properties were also investigated. The results indicate that the Cu(II) complexes interact with calf-thymus DNA by both partially intercalative and hydrogen binding. These findings have been further substantiated by the determination of intrinsic binding constants spectrophotometrically, 12.5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(5) for 1 and 2, respectively. Our findings suggest that the type of ligands and structure of complexes have marked effect on the binding affinity of complexes involving CT-DNA. Circular dichroism results show that complex 1 causes considerable increase in base stacking of DNA, whereas 2 decreases the base stacking, which is related to more extended aromatic area of 1,10-phenanthroline in 1 rather than bipyridine in 2. Slow decrease in DNA viscosity indicates partially intercalative binding in addition to hydrogen binding on the surface of DNA.

We have shown in vitro that vincristine is metabolized significantly more efficiently by CYP3A5 than by CYP3A4. We also found that vincristine neurotoxicity is less common in African-Americans (70% express CYP3A5) than in Caucasians. We test the hypothesis that CYP3A5 expressers experience less vincristine neuropathy than do CYP3A5 non-expressers. PROCEDURE: This study of pharmacogenetics of vincristine neuropathy in children with preB ALL was completed at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center. Whole blood for DNA extraction and genotyping was collected as well as plasma from a single time-point for analysis of vincristine and primary metabolite (M1) concentrations. Vincristine neuropathy was captured via chart review and graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of CYP3A5 expressers experienced neurotoxicity versus 100% of non-expressers (P = 0.03). The proportion of treatment months with neurotoxicity was significantly different between the expressers and non-expressers (16% vs. 27%, P = 0.0007). Limited pharmacokinetic data suggest different rates of vincristine metabolism between CYP3A5 genotype groups with higher primary metabolite (M1) plasma concentrations (P = 0.0004) and lower metabolic ratios ([vincristine]/[M1]) (P = 0.036) in the CYP3A5 expressers compared to the CYP3A5 non-expressers. M1 concentration was also inversely related to severity of neuropathy (P = 0.0316). CONCLUSIONS: In children with preB ALL, CYP3A5 expressers experience less VIPN, produce more M1, and have lower metabolic ratios compared to CYP3A5 non-expressers.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Egbelakin, Akinbode', 'Ferguson, Michael J', 'MacGill, Emily A', 'Lehmann, Amalia S', 'Topletz, Ariel R', 'Quinney, Sara K', 'Li, Lang', 'McCammack, Kevin C', 'Hall, Stephen D', 'Renbarger, Jamie L']","['Egbelakin A', 'Ferguson MJ', 'MacGill EA', 'Lehmann AS', 'Topletz AR', 'Quinney SK', 'Li L', 'McCammack KC', 'Hall SD', 'Renbarger JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['K23 RR019956-01A1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 RR019956-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD062484/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 RR019956-02/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 RR019956/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 RR019956-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025014/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 RR019956-04/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101111,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/ethnology/*genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Whites']",PMC3020258,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22845 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Mar;56(3):361-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22845.

This study focuses on the effects of ABT-737 on leukemia cells with MLL rearrangement and identifies some of the biological correlates of its activity. PROCEDURE: Cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of ABT-737 alone or in combination with other agents. After 4 days in culture, cell growth inhibition was measured by Alamar blue assay. The expression and activation of potential intracellular targets of ABT-737 activity were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Significant Bcl-2 expression was detected in all infant leukemia cells investigated. ABT-737 induced cell death in all cell lines studied although the IC(50) values differed somewhat between cell lines. Western blot analysis identified the effects of ABT-737 on survival and apoptosis-regulatory proteins PARP, caspase-8, and cytochrome-c. Drug combination studies indicated synergy with distinct anti-neoplastic agents, including the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. This effective drug synergy appears to be mediated by the combined inhibition of Bcl-2 and intracellular signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the in vitro studies to demonstrate the activity and drug combinability of ABT-737 against MLL rearranged leukemia cells. In addition, identification of the molecular changes that occur in the presence of ABT-737 provides information regarding effective target validation and target modulation analyses in future clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Jayanthan, Aarthi', 'Incoronato, Andrea', 'Singh, Anjali', 'Blackmore, Christopher', 'Bernoux, Delphine', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Stam, Ronald', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Jayanthan A', 'Incoronato A', 'Singh A', 'Blackmore C', 'Bernoux D', 'Lewis V', 'Stam R', 'Whitlock JA', 'Narendran A']","[""Hughes' Children's Cancer Research Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101128,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22760 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Mar;56(3):353-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22760.

It was demonstrated previously that the STAT3 pathway maintains the tumorigenicity and therapeutic resistance of malignant tumors as well as cancer stem cells (CSCs). The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of the strong STAT3 inhibitor, cucurbitacin I, in prominin-1 (CD133)-positive lung cancer cells. METHODS: CD133-positive and CD133-negative NSCLC-derived cells were isolated from 7 patients with NSCLC. CD133-positive NSCLC cells that were treated with or without cucurbitacin I were evaluated for their expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), tumorigenicity, stemness properties, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation. RESULTS: Compared with parental or CD133-negative NSCLC cells, CD133-positive NSCLC cells had greater tumorigenicity, greater radioresistance, and higher expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4), Nanog homeobox, and sex-determining region Y, box 2 (Sox2) at high p-STAT3 levels. Cucurbitacin I treatment at 100 nM effectively abrogated STAT3 activation, tumorigenic capacity, sphere formation ability, radioresistance, and chemoresistance in CD133-positive NSCLC cells. Microarray data suggested that cucurbitacin I inhibited the stemness gene signature of CD133-positive NSCLC cells and facilitated the differentiation of CD133-positive NSCLC cells into CD133-negative NSCLC cells. It is noteworthy that 150 nM cucurbitacin I effectively blocked STAT3 signaling and downstream survival targets, such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-like 1 (Bcl-xL) expression and induced apoptosis in CD133-positive NSCLC cells. Finally, xenotransplantation experiments revealed that cucurbitacin I plus radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic drugs significantly suppressed tumorigenesis and improved survival in NSCLC-CD133-positive-transplanted, immunocompromised mice. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting STAT3 signaling in CD133-positive NSCLC cells with cucurbitacin I suppressed CSC-like properties and enhanced chemoradiotherapy response.

RESULTS: We present a case of an 82 year old male who presented with a 18 month history of progressive right parotid enlargement. His past medical history is notable for renal cell carcinoma status post partial nephrectomy in 1990, followed by completion nephrectomy 15 years later. He also has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has not been treated. He complained of some pain symptoms, but no signs of facial paralysis. Fine needle aspiration was non-diagnostic. The patient underwent a total parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation, and final pathology was consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. Based on our literature review we believe this to be the longest disease free interval of renal cell carcinoma preceding a metastatic lesion to the parotid gland.",,"['Deeb, Robert', 'Zhang, Ziying', 'Kini, Sudha', 'Ghanem, Tamer']","['Deeb R', 'Zhang Z', 'Kini S', 'Ghanem T']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*secondary/surgery', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Nephrectomy', 'Parotid Neoplasms/*secondary/surgery', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/lary.21592 [doi]'],ppublish,Laryngoscope. 2010;120 Suppl 4:S128. doi: 10.1002/lary.21592.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZFAT is highly conserved among species and functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule in the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, MOLT-4. We recently demonstrated that ZFAT is an essential molecule for hematopoietic differentiation in blood islands through the direct regulation of particular transcriptional factors, including Tal1, for endothelial cell assembly, and for the branch point formation of capillary-like structures. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-apoptotic function of ZFAT remain unknown. Here, we report that ZFAT knockdown by small interfering RNA induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This response had been similarly observed for MOLT-4 cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms for ZFAT in anti-apoptotic function in both MEFs and MOLT-4 cells, microarray expression analysis and quantitative RT-PCR were done. Of interest was that Bcl-2 and Il6st were identified as commonly down-regulated genes by the depletion of ZFAT for both MEFs and MOLT-4 cells. These results suggest that ZFAT is a critical molecule for cell survival in MEFs and MOLT-4 cells at least in part through the regulation of the apoptosis involved in the BCL-2- and IL6st-mediated pathways. Further elucidation of the molecular functions for ZFAT might shed light on the cellular programs in the mesoderm-derived cells.",,"['Doi, Keiko', 'Fujimoto, Takahiro', 'Koyanagi, Midori', 'Tsunoda, Toshiyuki', 'Tanaka, Yoko', 'Yoshida, Yasuhiro', 'Takashima, Yasuo', 'Kuroki, Masahide', 'Sasazuki, Takehiko', 'Shirasawa, Senji']","['Doi K', 'Fujimoto T', 'Koyanagi M', 'Tsunoda T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Takashima Y', 'Kuroki M', 'Sasazuki T', 'Shirasawa S']","['Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, 7-45-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101227,England,Cell Mol Biol Lett,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,"['0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZFAT protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC6275631,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/04/29 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2478/s11658-010-0041-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Biol Lett. 2011 Mar;16(1):89-100. doi: 10.2478/s11658-010-0041-1.

Using a sensitive and robust non-radioactive in vitro assay, we observed that CGP74588 accumulates in significantly higher amount than imatinib in sensitive K562 cells. In contrast, the intracellular level of CGP74588 was significantly lower than that of imatinib in K562/Dox cells, which represent a multidrug-resistant variant of K562 cells due to the P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1, MDR1) overexpression. An in vitro enzyme-based assay provided evidence that CGP74588 might serve as an excellent substrate for P-gp. Accordingly, we found that CGP74588 up to 20 muM concentration neither induced apoptosis nor inhibited substantially cell proliferation in resistant K562/Dox cells. In contrast, CGP74588 was capable to inhibit cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in sensitive K562 cells, although its effect was approximately three to four times lower than that of imatinib in the same cell line.

In the eye, degeneration of neural cells in the retina is a hallmark of such widespread ocular diseases as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa. Bone marrow is an ideal tissue for studying stem cells mainly because of its accessibility. Furthermore, there are a number of well-defined mouse models and cell surface markers that allow effective study of hematopoiesis in healthy and injured mice. Because of these characteristics and the experience of bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of hematological disease such as leukemia, bone marrow-derived stem cells have also become a major tool in regenerative medicine.

However, because most HES patients lack FIP1L1-PDGFRA, we studied whether they harbor activating mutations of the PDGFRA gene. Sequencing of 87 FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative HES patients revealed several novel PDGFRA point mutations (R481G, L507P, I562M, H570R, H650Q, N659S, L705P, R748G, and Y849S). When cloned into 32D cells, N659S and Y849S and-on selection for high expressors-also H650Q and R748G mutants induced growth factor-independent proliferation, clonogenic growth, and constitutive phosphorylation of PDGFRA and Stat5. Imatinib antagonized Stat5 phosphorylation. Mutations involving positions 659 and 849 had been shown previously to possess transforming potential in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Because H650Q and R748G mutants possessed only weak transforming activity, we injected 32D cells harboring these mutants or FIP1L1-PDGFRA into mice and found that they induced a leukemia-like disease. Oral imatinib treatment significantly decreased leukemic growth in vivo and prolonged survival.

Despite their excellent initial treatment response, up to 20% of patients relapse. To gain insight into the relapse mechanisms, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism arrays for DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 18 matched diagnosis and relapse leukemias. CNAs were more abundant at relapse than at diagnosis (mean 12.5 vs 7.5 per case; P=.01) with 5.3 shared on average. Their patterns revealed a direct clonal relationship with exclusively new aberrations at relapse in only 21.4%, whereas 78.6% shared a common ancestor and subsequently acquired distinct CNA. Moreover, we identified recurrent, mainly nonoverlapping deletions associated with glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis targeting the Bcl2 modifying factor (BMF) (n=3), glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 (n=4), and components of the mismatch repair pathways (n=3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization screening of additional 24 relapsed and 72 nonrelapsed ETV6/RUNX1-positive cases demonstrated that BMF deletions were significantly more common in relapse cases (16.6% vs 2.8%; P=.02).

In contrast to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where Notch activation promotes leukemogenesis, induction of Notch signaling in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. The Notch target Hairy/Enhancer of Split1 (HES1) is sufficient to reproduce this tumor suppressor phenotype in B-ALL; however, the mechanism is not yet known. We report that HES1 regulates proapoptotic signals by the novel interacting protein Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase1 (PARP1) in a cell type-specific manner. Interaction of HES1 with PARP1 inhibits HES1 function, induces PARP1 activation, and results in PARP1 cleavage in B-ALL. HES1-induced PARP1 activation leads to self-ADP ribosylation of PARP1, consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(+), diminished adenosine triphosphate levels, and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to the nucleus, resulting in apoptosis in B-ALL but not T-cell ALL. Importantly, induction of Notch signaling by the Notch agonist peptide Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 can reproduce these events and leads to B-ALL apoptosis. The novel interaction of HES1 and PARP1 in B-ALL modulates the function of the HES1 transcriptional complex and signals through PARP1 to induce apoptosis. This mechanism shows a cell type-specific proapoptotic pathway that may lead to Notch agonist-based cancer therapeutics.",,"['Kannan, Sankaranarayanan', 'Fang, Wendy', 'Song, Guangchun', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Hammitt, Richard', 'McMurray, John', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A']","['Kannan S', 'Fang W', 'Song G', 'Mullighan CG', 'Hammitt R', 'McMurray J', 'Zweidler-McKay PA']","['Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas M.

Splice modulation involved various splicing factors, with the phosphorylation state of serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins also altered during the splicing process. Pretreatment with okadaic acid to inhibit protein phosphatase PP1 reversed partially the phosphorylation levels of SR proteins and also the amiloride-modulated yields of Bcl-xs and HIPK3 U(-) isoforms. Genome-wide detection of alternative splicing further revealed that many other apoptotic genes were regulated by amiloride, including APAF-1, CRK, and SURVIVIN. Various proteins of the Bcl-2 family and MAPK kinases were found to be involved in amiloride-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the effect of amiloride on mRNA levels of Bcl-x was demonstrated to translate to the protein levels. Cotreatment of K562 and BaF3/Bcr-AblT315I cells with amiloride and imatinib induced more loss of cell viability than either agent alone.

Because nTreg is a rare population in a healthy individual, the limited source and the non-selective suppression are major hurdles towards the application of nTregs in the control of clinical GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). An alternative approach is to generate induced Tregs (iTregs) from naive CD4 precursors, but the effectiveness of iTregs in the control of GVHD is highly controversial and requires further investigation. The other critical but unsolved issue in Treg therapy is how to achieve antigen (Ag)-specific tolerance that distinguishes GVHD and GVL effects. To address the important issues on the effectiveness of iTregs and Ag-specificity of Tregs, we generated Ag-specific iTregs and tested their potential in the prevention of GVHD in a pre-clinical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) iTregs generated from OT-II TCR transgenic T cells specific for OVA target Ag efficiently prevented GVHD induced by polyclonal T effector cells (Teffs) only in the allogeneic recipients that express OVA protein but not in OVA(-) recipients. The efficacy of these Ag-specific iTregs was significantly higher than polyclonal iTregs. As controls, OT-II CD4(+)Foxp3(-) cells had no effect on GVHD development in OVA(-) recipients and exacerbated GVHD in OVA(+) recipients when transplanted together with polyclonal Teffs. Because the iTregs recognize OVA whereas Teffs recognize alloAg bm12, our data reveal for the first time, to our knowledge, that Tregs prevent GVHD through a linked suppression. Mechanistically, OT-II iTregs expanded extensively, and significantly suppressed expansion and infiltration of Teffs in OVA(+) but not in OVA(-) recipients. These results demonstrate that Ag-specific iTregs can prevent GVHD efficiently and selectively, providing a proof of principle that Ag-specific iTregs may represent a promising cell therapy for their specificity and higher efficacy in allogeneic HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The down-regulation of TIMP-2, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP decreased the invasion rates of SHI-1 cells by 60% - 70%, 50% - 60% and 40% - 50%, respectively (P < 0.05). No activated MMP-2 in the supernatants from any knock-down cells could be found. CONCLUSIONS: SHI-1 cells constitutively overexpress MMP-2, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 at both mRNA and protein levels. After co-cultured with BMSCs the SHI-1 cells increased MMP-2 activation and cell invasion. An increase of TIMP-2 expression in SHI-1 cells reflects an activating effect on cells invasion and MMP-2 activation.",,"['Wang, Chun-Ling', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Li, Zhen-Jiang', 'Cen, Jian-Nong']","['Wang CL', 'Chen ZX', 'Li ZJ', 'Cen JN']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases, Membrane-Associated)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', '*Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases, Membrane-Associated', 'RNA, Messenger']",,2011/01/13 06:00,2016/04/24 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Dec;31(12):798-803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-four chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients received HSCT were analyzed retrospectively based on bcr-abl kinetics post HSCT. Patients were divided into three groups, imatinib group (n = 13), immunotherapy group (n = 20)and combining both group (n = 31). The primary endpoint is molecular response, the second endpoint is side effect related to intervention. RESULTS: There was no difference among the three groups in converting to bcr-abl negativity (86.0%, 90.0% and 83.9%, respectively, P = 0.126), 4 years cumulative relapse incidence (32.3%, 0% and 16.1%, respectively, P = 0.130) and 4 years OS (90.0%, 89.7%, 83.0%, respectively, P = 0.696).

CONCLUSIONS: All three regimens can give a quick and durable molecular remission in most of the patients, but side effects are different. The choice of regimen should be balanced with toxicity individually.

In this study we compare four types of mOSM-RFPs that contain either domains D1-D3 or domains D2-D3 of mgp130 and are arranged in two ways. Domain D1 of mgp130 turned out to be dispensable for mOSM-binding. However, the arrangement of the two receptor subunits is essential for the inhibitory activity. We found mOSM induced STAT3 phosphorylation to be suppressed only when the mOSMR fragment was fused in front of the mgp130 fragment. CONCLUSIONS: mOSM-RFP consisting of D1-D4 of mOSMR and D2-D3 of mgp130 is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of mOSM. Since mOSM-RFP is encoded by a single gene it offers numerous possibilities for specific cytokine inhibition in gene delivery approaches based on viral vectors, transgenic animals and finally gene therapy.",,"['Brolund, Liv', 'Kuster, Andrea', 'Korr, Sabrina', 'Vogt, Michael', 'Muller-Newen, Gerhard']","['Brolund L', 'Kuster A', 'Korr S', 'Vogt M', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical School, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110111,England,BMC Biotechnol,BMC biotechnology,101088663,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Osmr protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3040522,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/05/26 06:00,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6750-11-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6750-11-3 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biotechnol. 2011 Jan 11;11:3. doi: 10.1186/1472-6750-11-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews the use of intravenous rituximab in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), low-grade or follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The addition of rituximab to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide significantly prolonged progression-free survival both in previously untreated patients with CLL and in those with relapsed or refractory CLL, according to the results of two randomized, open-label, multicenter trials. In patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP]; cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone [CVP]; mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone; or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisolone) was generally associated with better outcomes than chemotherapy alone in randomized, multicenter trials. In a similarly designed trial, progression-free survival was significantly longer in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma, other indolent lymphomas, or mantle-cell lymphoma who received rituximab plus bendamustine than in those receiving rituximab plus CHOP. Monotherapy with rituximab also demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular lymphoma, according to the results of noncomparative trials. In terms of maintenance therapy, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with rituximab maintenance therapy versus observation alone in patients with advanced indolent lymphoma who had not progressed following first-line therapy with CVP and in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who had responded to CHOP (with or without rituximab), according to the results of randomized, open-label, multicenter trials. In four randomized, open-label, multicenter trials in younger or elderly patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, event-free survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were generally improved to a significant extent by the addition of rituximab to CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy. Intravenous rituximab was generally well tolerated in patients with CLL, low-grade or follicular lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, both as monotherapy and when administered in combination with chemotherapy. Infusion reactions were one of the most commonly occurring adverse events in patients receiving intravenous rituximab. The results of pharmacoeconomic modeling analyses demonstrated that rituximab appears to be cost effective in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, in patients with follicular lymphoma receiving rituximab maintenance therapy following treatment for relapsed or refractory disease, and in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In conclusion, rituximab remains a valuable therapy in patients with CLL, low-grade or follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and, in a variety of treatment settings, represents the standard of care.",,"['Keating, Gillian M']",['Keating GM'],"['Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,,,,2011/01/13 06:00,2011/01/13 06:01,['2011/01/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['5 [pii]', '10.2165/11206980-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2011 Feb 1;25(1):55-61. doi: 10.2165/11206980-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,['Drugs. 2010 Jul 30;70(11):1445-76.

Recently, the rate of progress in terms of further improvements in overall outcome has paradoxically slowed. Novel strategies are therefore needed to assure continued advances. On the one hand, international and global consortia of subspecialists will continue to focus on the development of much needed improved therapies for those disease groups that have not yet seen their prognosis brighten, and on the other hand, there is a trend to invest in the development of joint-care initiatives that assure cost-effective access to standard therapy for all. This will require closer involvement of the general pediatrician in certain aspects of cancer care in its broadest sense. We hope the upcoming series will aid this process by highlighting selected topics in pediatric oncology that are likely to gain even more relevance for the general pediatrician in the years to come.

However, resistance to treatment is of increasing importance and often is due to point mutations in the Abl kinase domain (Abl KD). Here, we analysed clinical outcome and mutation status in two independent Nordic populations (n = 77) of imatinib-resistant CML patients. We detected BCR-ABL transcripts containing point mutations of residues in the P-loop, A-loop and other kinase domain residues in 32 patients (42%). In contrast to previous data, mutations in BCR-ABL were as frequently found in patients with primary resistance (56%) as with secondary resistance (53%). No T315I mutations were found in the study cohort. BCR-ABL splice variants were identified in a significant number of our cases (19%): BCR-ABL transcripts of variable length; a variant fusion transcript joining BCR exon 14 sequences to ABL exon 4; partial, in-frame-deletion of exon 4 due to induction of a cryptic splice site by the L248V and finally, alternative splicing of ABL exon 7 sequences. Though the majority of splice variants observed in this study do not encode functional proteins, alternative splicing appears to represent a common phenomenon in the biology of CML. We conclude that Abl KD point mutations represent a major mechanism of imatinib resistance. Other sequence irregularities were also detected, but their significance in conferring resistance is unclear.

BCR-ABL mutations, however, contribute to treatment resistance by disrupting drug contact sites or causing conformational changes thus making contact sites inaccessible. Clinical data indicate that developing BCR-ABL mutations during imatinib treatment is predictive for shorter progression-free survival, and that outcomes may depend on mutation type or location. In vitro, dasatinib and nilotinib inhibit most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, except for T315I.

Cell-contact and soluble factors are demonstrated to play a role in the growth inhibition of tumor cells mediated by MSCs in vitro, while there is little clue about signaling pathways involved in the process. P38 MAPK has been implicated as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We here investigate whether p38 MAPK is involved in MSC-induced growth inhibition of leukemic tumor cells. METHODS: We characterized the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) on proliferation, cell cycle and phosphorylation pattern of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, or p38 MAPK-small interfering RNA (siRNA), were used to identify the role of p38 in growth suppression by UC-MSCs. We also investigated the expression of cell cycle regulators. RESULTS: Treatment with UC-MSCs led to potent proliferation-inhibition of HL60 and K562 cells without inducing apoptosis. Growth inhibition by UC-MSCs was due to G0/G1 arrest. UC-MSCs increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing (through siRNA) of p38 MAPK partially abrogated the proliferation-suppression and cell cycle arrest caused by UC-MSCs. UC-MSCs also modulated the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in HL60 and K562 cells while SB203580 reversed the effect. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicate that p38 MAPK is critical for the growth inhibitory effect of UC-MSCs on leukemic tumor cells.","['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

Here we show that the expression level of the transcription factor STAT5 is another parameter that determines the sensitivity of BCR-ABL1(+) cells against tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib. Abelson-transformed cells, expressing high levels of STAT5, were found to be significantly less sensitive to TKI-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo but not to other cytotoxic drugs, such as hydroxyurea, interferon-beta, or Aca-dC. The STAT5-mediated protection requires tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 independent of JAK2 and transcriptional activity. In support of this concept, under imatinib treatment and with disease progression, STAT5 mRNA and protein levels increased in patients with Ph(+) chronic myeloid leukemia. Based on our data, we propose a model in which disease progression in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia leads to up-regulated STAT5 expression. This may be in part the result of clonal selection of cells with high STAT5 levels. STAT5 then accounts for the resistance against TKIs, thereby explaining the dose escalation frequently required in patients reaching accelerated phase. It also suggests that STAT5 may serve as an attractive target to overcome imatinib resistance in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia.",,"['Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Kollmann, Karoline', 'Eckelhart, Eva', 'Fajmann, Sabine', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Holbl, Andrea', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Egger, Gerda', 'Valent, Peter', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Warsch W', 'Kollmann K', 'Eckelhart E', 'Fajmann S', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Holbl A', 'Gleixner KV', 'Dworzak M', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Hoermann G', 'Herrmann H', 'Sillaber C', 'Egger G', 'Valent P', 'Moriggl R', 'Sexl V']","['Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['F 2810/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/physiology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/01/12 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36506-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-248211 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 24;117(12):3409-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-248211.

This resistance to apoptosis partly results from Mcl-1 expression because high levels of this protein in CLL cells correlate with poor disease prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, understanding the mechanism(s) regulating Mcl-1 expression in CLL cells may be useful in the development of new therapies for this incurable disease. In the present study, we show a strong relationship between c-Abl and Mcl-1 expression in CLL cells. We show that treatment of CLL cells with Abl-specific siRNA or with imatinib, to inhibit c-Abl activity, results in the down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein and mRNA. A major regulator of Mcl-1 gene expression is STAT3. Our data show that CLL cells expressing high levels of c-Abl also show elevated levels of phospho-STAT3, and that STAT3 phosphorylation in CLL cells is dependent on c-Abl activity. However, STAT3 phosphorylation by c-Abl requires activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, secretion of autocrine interleukin-6, and active protein kinase C. Taken together, our data demonstrate the mechanism involved in c-Abl regulation of Mcl-1 expression in CLL cells, and suggest that c-Abl inhibition has therapeutic application in the treatment of this disease.",,"['Allen, John C', 'Talab, Fatima', 'Zuzel, Mirko', 'Lin, Ke', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Allen JC', 'Talab F', 'Zuzel M', 'Lin K', 'Slupsky JR']","['Division of Haematology, Liverpool Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Liverpool, Daulby Street, Liverpool, UK. jcallen@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/01/12 06:00,2011/05/13 06:00,['2011/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56976-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-301176 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Feb 24;117(8):2414-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-301176.

RESULTS: Contemporary treatments have resulted in 5-year event-free survival rates of approximately 80% for childhood ALL and almost 60% for pediatric AML. The advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses has provided new insights into leukemogenesis and identified many novel subtypes of leukemia. Virtually all ALL and the vast majority of AML cases can be classified according to specific genetic abnormalities. Cooperative mutations involved in cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, drug responsiveness, and apoptosis have also been identified in many cases.

Consolidation with high-dose cytarabine or stem-cell transplantation in high-risk patients will restrict overall relapse to approximately 50%. A number of demographic features can predict the outcome of treatment including cytogenetics and an increasing list of molecular features (ie, FLT3, NPM1, MLL, WT1, CEBPalpha, EVI1). These are increasingly being used to direct postinduction therapy, but they are also molecular targets for a new generation of small molecule inhibitors that are in early development; however, randomized data have yet to emerge. In older patients who comprise the majority, which will increase with demographic change, the initial clinical decision to be made is whether the patient should receive an intensive or nonintensive approach. If the same anthracycline/cytarabine-based approach is deployed, the remission rate will be around 50%, but the risk of subsequent relapse is approximately 85% at 3 years. This difference from younger patients is explained partly by the ability of patients to tolerate effective therapy, and also the aggregation of several poor risk factors compared with the young.

Recently reported studies from large cooperative trials have also shown that more rational delivery of treatment and improved outcomes may derive from the use of risk-adapted protocols. In particular, patients at higher risk of relapse (ie, those presenting with WBC > 10 x 10(9)/L) seem to benefit from treatments that include cytarabine in the ATRA-plus-chemotherapy scheme, whereas patients with standard-risk disease can be successfully managed with less-intensive regimens that contain ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. After the outstanding results with arsenic trioxide (ATO) in the treatment of APL relapse, several experimental trials have been designed to explore the role of ATO in front-line therapy with the aim not only of minimizing the use of chemotherapy but also to reinforce standard ATRA-plus-chemotherapy regimens and additionally improve therapeutic efficacy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed changes in the incidence of TRM and overall survival from 1985 through 2004 in 5,972 patients younger than age 50 years who received myeloablative conditioning and HCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) or second complete remission (CR2). RESULTS: Among HLA-matched sibling donor transplantation recipients, the relative risks (RRs) for TRM were 0.5 and 0.3 for 2000 to 2004 compared with those for 1985 to 1989 in patients in CR1 and CR2, respectively (P < .001). The RRs for all causes of mortality in the latter period were 0.73 (P = .001) and 0.60 (P = .005) for the CR1 and CR2 groups, respectively. Among unrelated donor transplantation recipients, the RRs for TRM were 0.73 (P = .095) and 0.58 (P < .001) for 2000 to 2004 compared with those in 1990 to 1994 in the CR1 and CR2 groups, respectively. Reductions in mortality were observed in the CR2 group (RR, 0.74; P = .03) but not in the CR1 group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that innovations in transplantation care since the 1980s and 1990s have reduced the risk of TRM in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for AML and that this reduction has been accompanied by improvements in overall survival.",,"['Horan, John T', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Agovi-Johnson, Manza-A', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea A', 'Ballen, Karen K', 'Bredeson, Christopher N', 'Carabasi, Matthew H', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Khoury, Hanna Jean', 'Juckett, Mark B', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Pasquini, Marcelo C']","['Horan JT', 'Logan BR', 'Agovi-Johnson MA', 'Lazarus HM', 'Bacigalupo AA', 'Ballen KK', 'Bredeson CN', 'Carabasi MH', 'Gupta V', 'Hale GA', 'Khoury HJ', 'Juckett MB', 'Litzow MR', 'Martino R', 'McCarthy PL', 'Smith FO', 'Rizzo JD', 'Pasquini MC']","[""Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20110110,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forecasting', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/*mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3068057,2011/01/12 06:00,2011/05/07 06:00,['2011/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.5001 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.5001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar 1;29(7):805-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.5001.

Although interferon represented one of the initial major therapeutic advances in the management of this disease in 1984, the subsequent introduction of purine nucleoside analogs (pentostatin and cladribine) changed the natural history of this rare disease by achieving a high rate of complete and durable remissions. The disease-free survival after effective therapy has not reached a plateau, suggesting control but not cure of the disease. Identification of minimal residual disease in patients achieving a complete hematologic remission provides insight into the potential source for predicting eventual relapse. Modern strategies of targeted therapies directed against immunophenotypic markers on the leukemic cells provide hope that improved long-term control of the disease is possible. Combined chemoimmunotherapy may hold the highest promise for disease eradication, but the optimal strategy for using this approach is under active investigation. Despite the perception by hematologists that this disease has already been conquered, there are critically important unanswered questions that remain. Investigation of the bone marrow microenvironment and its impact on minimal residual disease may ultimately prevent relapse. Consideration of the median age of patients at diagnosis combined with a substantial relapse rate mandates continued pursuit of improved therapy.

Treatment of MDS is tailored to the specific risk characteristics of the patient. In general, patients are divided into lower- and higher-risk categories. Without therapy, prognosis of patients with higher-risk MDS is poor, and treatments should be directed to improve survival. Prognosis of patients with lower-risk MDS is more heterogeneous, and therapies are usually directed to minimize transfusion needs and potentially to alter the natural course of the disease. Treatment options for patients with higher-risk MDS include hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), intensive chemotherapy (ICT), and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). The use of the hypomethylating agents has transformed the approach to this patient population, in particular older individuals, for whom ICT and alloSCT are not an option. In lower-risk MDS, treatment strategies are used sequentially and usually include observation in patients with low risk and no transfusion dependency, growth factors, and lenalidomide for patients with alteration of chromosome 5 and anemia. The use of hypomethylating agents is less understood in this group of patients. AlloSCT is usually reserved for patients with lower-risk MDS closer to the time of transformation. In this short review, we discuss treatment alternatives for patients with MDS and delineate some of the ongoing challenges, including the development of better front-line strategies for patients with higher-risk disease, the concept of altering the natural course of the disease in lower-risk MDS, and the development of new treatment approaches for patients who do not benefit from hypomethylating agents.",,"['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Fenaux P']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Box 428, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, PO Box 301402, Houston, TX 77025, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['1RCTCA147431-01/PHS HHS/United States', '5P0CA108631-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110110,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '64FS3BFH5W (Epoetin Alfa)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Epoetin Alfa', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3056493,2011/01/12 06:00,2011/03/24 06:00,['2011/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.31.0854 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.31.0854 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Feb 10;29(5):516-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.31.0854.

The spectrum of genetic abnormalities in MDS implicates a wide range of molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these disorders, including activation of tyrosine kinase signaling, genomic instability, impaired differentiation, altered ribosome function, and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. Specific alterations present in individual patients with MDS may explain much of the heterogeneity in clinical phenotype associated with this disease and can predict prognosis and response to therapy.

Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) is the only known cure for this disease. The treatment is routinely used for younger patients, but only a minority of patients older than the age of 60 undergo this procedure. The overall MDS incidence is 3.3 per 100,000, but the incidence in patients older than age 70 is between 15 and 50 per 100,000. The median age at presentation is 76 years. Medicare-age patients 65 or older represent 80% of the total population receiving an MDS diagnosis. In the United States, one of the obstacles to SCT for older patients with MDS has been lack of third party reimbursement. On August 4, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released their Decision Memo for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) for Myelodysplastic Syndrome. This memo states: ""Allogeneic HSCT for MDS is covered by Medicare only for beneficiaries with MDS participating in an approved clinical study that meets the criteria below....

We reported that plasmid-based overexpression of constitutively active FOXO3 in cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) reduced their survival, suggesting that increasing FOXO3 activity in hematologic malignancies may represent a promising therapeutic strategy. The transactivating transcription factor (TAT) protein transduction domain (PTD) derived from the HIV TAT protein was shown to efficiently deliver macromolecular cargo in various cell types. In this study, wild-type FOXO3 and FOXO3 mutated on Akt sites [FOXO3 T32A/S253A/S315A or TM (triple mutant)] were fused to the TAT-PTD. Using biochemical techniques, flow cytometry, and microscopy analysis, we found a rapid and dose-dependent cell penetration into leukemic cells of unlabeled and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled TAT-FOXO3 fusion proteins followed by their accumulation within nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Treatment with TAT-FOXO3 TM-but not wild-type TAT-FOXO3-proteins induced Jurkat and K562 leukemic cell death and affected cell viability of other hematologic malignancies including primary cells from CLL. Cell transduction with TAT-FOXO3 TM induced apoptotic cell death as shown by morphologic changes, Annexin V/7-AAD (7-amino-actinomycin D) staining, activation of effector caspases, and PARP cleavage, caspase blockade through the use of the inhibitor Z-VAD, and expression of Bim and p27(KIP1). By contrast, TAT-FOXO3 TM blocked cell proliferation of primary T cells, without affecting their viability.

The crystal structure of WDR5 in ternary complex with RbBP5 and MLL1 reveals that both proteins binds peptide-binding clefts located on opposite sides of WDR5's beta-propeller domain. RbBP5 engages in several hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts within a V-shaped cleft formed by the junction of two blades on WDR5. Mutational analyses of both the WDR5 V-shaped cleft and RbBP5 residues reveal that the interactions between RbBP5 and WDR5 are important for the stimulation of MLL1 methyltransferase activity.

However, the progress of mESC research is restricted and limited to highly funded laboratories due to the cost of commercial LIF. Here we presented the homemade hLIF which is biologically active. The hLIF cDNA was cloned into two different vectors in order to produce N-terminal His(6)-tag and Trx-His(6)-tag hLIF fusion proteins in Origami(DE3) Escherichia coli. The His(6)-hLIF fusion protein was not as soluble as the Trx-His(6)-hLIF fusion protein. One-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was done to recover high purity (> 95% pure) His(6)-hLIF and Trx-His(6)-hLIF fusion proteins with the yields of 100 and 200 mg/l of cell culture, respectively. The hLIF fusion proteins were identified by Western blot and verified by mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The hLIF fusion proteins specifically promote the proliferation of TF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. They also demonstrate the potency to retain the morphology of undifferentiated mESCs, in that they were positive for mESC markers (Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog, SSEA-1 and alkaline phosphatase activity). These results demonstrated that the N-terminal fusion tags of the His(6)-hLIF and Trx-His(6)-hLIF fusion proteins do not interfere with their biological activity.

Under optimal reaction conditions, ALV-A LAMP produced neither cross-reactions with other major subgroups (including subgroups J, B, C, and E) nor nonspecific reactions with other common avian infectious diseases. A sensitivity test showed that this method can detect 20 copies of proviral nucleic acid sequence within 45 min, which is 100 times more sensitive than the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Finally, mouse xenograft models of hepatocarcinoma (H22), sarcoma (S180) and gastric carcinoma (SGC7901) demonstrated that FNC had significant tumor growth inhibition activity in a dose-dependent manner with low toxicity.

Hippuristanol inhibited proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells, but not normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It induced cell cycle arrest during G(1) phase by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CDK4 and CDK6, and induced apoptosis by reducing the expression of Bcl-x(L), c-IAP2, XIAP and c-FLIP. The induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Hippuristanol also suppressed IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and depleted IKKalpha, IKKgamma, JunB and JunD, resulting in inactivation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. It also suppressed carbonic anhydrase type II expression.

ERK1/2 proteins also are important for normal cell functions. Thus, anti-cancer therapies that block all ERK1/2 signaling may result in undesirable toxicity to normal cells. As an alternative, we have used computational and biological approaches to identify low-molecular weight compounds that have the potential to interact with unique ERK1/2 docking sites and selectively inhibit interactions with substrates involved in promoting cell proliferation. METHODS: Colony formation and water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assays were used to determine the effects of test compounds on cell proliferation. Changes in phosphorylation and protein expression in response to test compound treatment were examined by immunoblotting and in vitro kinase assays. Apoptosis was determined with immunoblotting and caspase activity assays. RESULTS: In silico modeling was used to identify compounds that were structurally similar to a previously identified parent compound, called 76. From this screen, several compounds, termed 76.2, 76.3, and 76.4 sharing a common thiazolidinedione core with an aminoethyl side group, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. However, the active compounds were less effective in inhibiting proliferation or inducing apoptosis in non-transformed epithelial cells. Induction of HeLa cell apoptosis appeared to be through intrinsic mechanisms involving caspase-9 activation and decreased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic Bad protein. Cell-based and in vitro kinase assays indicated that compounds 76.3 and 76.4 directly inhibited ERK-mediated phosphorylation of caspase-9 and the p90Rsk-1 kinase, which phosphorylates and inhibits Bad, more effectively than the parent compound 76. Further examination of the test compound's mechanism of action showed little effects on related MAP kinases or other cell survival proteins. CONCLUSION: These findings support the identification of a class of ERK-targeted molecules that can induce apoptosis in transformed cells by inhibiting ERK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins.",,"['Boston, Sarice R', 'Deshmukh, Rahul', 'Strome, Scott', 'Priyakumar, U Deva', 'MacKerell, Alexander D Jr', 'Shapiro, Paul']","['Boston SR', 'Deshmukh R', 'Strome S', 'Priyakumar UD', 'MacKerell AD Jr', 'Shapiro P']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Maryland 20 N.

It can stabilize c-Myc and promote anchorage-independent cell growth and tumour formation. CIP2A is over-expressed in some solid tumours although its expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still unknown. METHODS: CIP2A mRNA and protein expressions were determined in bone marrow mononuclear cells of both patients with AML and healthy controls using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. We used siRNA to knock-down CIP2A expression in HL60 cells and then examined its potential roles during the pathological progression of AML. RESULTS: CIP2A mRNA was present in 54 of 70 (77.14%) patients with newly diagnosed AML and in 11 of 14 (70.86%) patients with relapsed AML, which was significantly higher than complete remission specimens and healthy controls (P<0.001). Knock-down of CIP2A in HL60 cells slowed down cell proliferation, decreased clonogenic activity and promoted cell differentiation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CIP2A is over-expressed in patients with newly diagnosed/relapsed AML and the expression of CIP2A could have potential use as a clinical marker for AML relapse after treatment. The high expression of CIP2A in HL60 cells may be related to active cell proliferation and arrest of cell differentiation.

HTLV-1-specific T-cell responses elicit antitumor and antiviral effects in experimental models, and are considered to be one of the most important determinants of the disease manifestation, since they are activated in HAM/TSP but not in ATL patients. The combination of low T-cell responses and elevated HTLV-1 proviral loads are features of ATL, and are also observed in a subpopulation of HTLV-1 carriers at the asymptomatic stage, suggesting that these features may be underlying risk factors. These risks may potentially be reduced by vaccination to activate HTLV-1-specific T-cell responses. HAM/TSP and ATL patients also differ in their levels of HTLV-1 mRNA expression, which are generally low in vivo but slightly higher in HAM/TSP patients. Our recent study indicated that viral expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cells is suppressed by stromal cells in culture through type-I IFNs. The suppression was reversible after isolation from the stromal cells, mimicking a long-standing puzzling phenomenon in HTLV-1 infection where the viral expression is very low in vivo and rapidly induced in vitro. Collectively, HTLV-1 is controlled by both acquired and innate immunity in vivo: HTLV-1-specific T-cells survey infected cells, and IFNs suppress viral expression. Both effects would contribute to a reduction in viral pathogenesis, although they may potentially influence or conflict with one another. The presence of double control systems for HTLV-1 infection provides a new concept for understanding the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-mediated malignant and inflammatory diseases.",['(c) 2011 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Kannagi, Mari', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Kinpara, Shuichi', 'Shimizu, Yukiko', 'Takamori, Ayako', 'Utsunomiya, Atae']","['Kannagi M', 'Hasegawa A', 'Kinpara S', 'Shimizu Y', 'Takamori A', 'Utsunomiya A']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110228,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,,IM,"['*Adaptive Immunity', 'Adult', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/virology']",,2011/01/12 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01862.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Apr;102(4):670-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01862.x.

METHODS: Patients (n = 12) received a single oral dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg on day 1 (control). On days 2-8, imatinib 400 mg was administered daily. On day 8 (treatment), another 1000 mg dose of paracetamol was administered 1 h after the morning dose of imatinib 400 mg. Blood and urine samples were collected for bioanalytical analyses. RESULTS: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide and paracetamol sulphate under control conditions was similar to that after treatment with imatinib; the 90% confidence interval of the log AUC ratio was within 0.8 to 1.25. Urinary excretion of paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide and paracetamol sulphate was also unaffected by imatinib. The pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and imatinib in Korean patients with CML were similar to previous pharmacokinetic results in white patients with CML. Co-administration of a single dose of paracetamol and multiple doses of imatinib was well tolerated and safety profiles were similar to those of either drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and its major metabolites in the presence of imatinib were similar to those of the control conditions and the combination was well tolerated.

This pathway has important potential for cancer therapeutics. Several proteins vital in cancer biology are regulated by protein neddylation. These observations led to the development of a small molecule inhibitor that disrupts protein neddylation and leads to cancer cell death and important activity in early phase clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an extensive coverage of cellular protein homeostasis with particular emphasis on the NEDD8 conjugation pathway. Insights into a new investigational drug that specifically disrupts the NEDD8 pathway are discussed. The clinical data for this agent are also updated. EXPERT OPINION: Neddylation controls key cellular pathways found to be dysregulated in many cancers. Protein neddylation is a relatively under-explored pathway for pharmacologic inhibition in cancer. Selective disruption of this pathway has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with myeloid neoplasms and is worth exploring further in combination with other anti-leukemia agents.,,"['Wang, Meng', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Erba, Harry P', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Swords, Ronan T']","['Wang M', 'Medeiros BC', 'Erba HP', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Giles FJ', 'Swords RT']","['Cambridge University, Medicine, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110110,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (NEDD8 Protein)', '0 (NEDD8 protein, human)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Design', 'Drugs, Investigational/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'NEDD8 Protein', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2011/01/12 06:00,2011/06/08 06:00,['2011/01/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2011.550877 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2011 Mar;15(3):253-64. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2011.550877.

Several basic mechanistic factors are required for the generation of most translocations. First, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) must be present simultaneously at the two participating loci. Second, the two broken loci must either be in proximity or be moved into proximity to be joined. Finally, cellular DNA repair pathways must be available to join the two broken loci to complete the translocation. These mechanistic factors can vary in different normal and mutant cells and, as a result, substantially influence the frequency at which particular translocations are generated in a given cell type. Ultimately, however, appearance of recurrent oncogenic translocations in tumors is, in most cases, strongly influenced by selection for the translocated oncogene during the tumorigenesis process. In this review, we discuss in depth the factors and pathways that contribute to the generation of translocations in lymphocytes and other cell types.

METHODS: The authors compared 2 schedules of palonosetron versus ondansetron in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with AML receiving high-dose cytarabine. Patients were randomized to: 1) ondansetron, 8 mg intravenously (IV), followed by 24 mg continuous infusion 30 minutes before high-dose cytarabine and until 12 hours after the high-dose cytarabine infusion ended; 2) palonosetron, 0.25 mg IV 30 minutes before chemotherapy, daily from Day 1 of high-dose cytarabine up to Day 5; or 3) palonosetron, 0.25 mg IV 30 minutes before high-dose cytarabine on Days 1, 3, and 5. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients on ondansetron and 48 patients on each of the palonosetron arms were evaluable for efficacy. Patients in the palonosetron arms achieved higher complete response rates (no emetic episodes plus no rescue medication), but the difference was not statistically significant (ondansetron, 21%; palonosetron on Days 1-5, 31%; palonosetron on Days 1, 3, and 5, 35%; P = .32). Greater than 77% of patients in each arm were free of nausea on Day 1; however, on Days 2 through 5, the proportion of patients without nausea declined similarly in all 3 groups. On Days 6 and 7, significantly more patients receiving palonosetron on Days 1 to 5 were free of nausea (P = .001 and P = .0247, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The daily assessments of emesis did not show significant differences between the study arms.

METHODS: A total of 98 patients were newly diagnosed with precursor B-ALL from June 2004 to December 2008 at the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea). Of those, 37 were eligible for flow cytometric MRD study analysis on day 14 of their induction treatment. The flow cytometric MRD assay was based on the expression intensity of CD19/CD10/CD34 or aberrant expression of myeloid antigens by bone marrow nucleated cells. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (94.6%) had CD19-positive leukemic cells that also expressed CD10 and/or CD34, and 18 (48.6%) had leukemic cells with aberrant expression of myeloid antigens. Seven patients with >/=1% leukemic cells on day 14 had a significantly lower relapse-free survival (RFS) compared to the 30 patients with lower levels (42.9% [18.7%] vs. 92.0% [5.4%], P=0.004). Stratification into 3 MRD groups (>/=1%, 0.1-1%, and <0.1%) also showed a statistically significant difference in RFS (42.9% [18.7%] vs. 86.9% [8.7%] vs. 100%, P=0.013). However, the MRD status had no significant influence on overall survival.

PML is a tumor suppressor and a pro-apoptotic factor. A fusion gene, PAX5-PML, was found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with chromosomal translocation t(9;15)(p13;q24), but no functional analysis has been reported. Here, we demonstrate that PAX5-PML had a dominant-negative effect on both PAX5 and PML. PAX5-PML dominant negatively inhibited PAX5 transcriptional activity in the luciferase reporter assay and suppressed the expression of the PAX5 transcriptional targets in B-lymphoid cell line. Surprisingly, PAX5-PML hardly showed DNA-binding activity in vitro although it retained the DNA-binding domain of PAX5. Additional experiments, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, suggested that PAX5-PML bound to the promoter through the association with PAX5 on the promoter. On the other hand, coexpression of PAX5-PML inhibited PML sumoylation, disrupted PML nuclear bodies (NBs), and conferred apoptosis resistance on HeLa cells. Furthermore, treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) induced PML sumoylation and reconstitution of PML NBs, and overcame the anti-apoptotic effect of PAX5-PML in HeLa cells. These data suggest the possible involvement of this fusion protein in the leukemogenesis of B-ALL in a dual dominant-negative manner and the possibility that ALL with PAX5-PML can be treated with ATO.",,"['Kurahashi, S', 'Hayakawa, F', 'Miyata, Y', 'Yasuda, T', 'Minami, Y', 'Tsuzuki, S', 'Abe, A', 'Naoe, T']","['Kurahashi S', 'Hayakawa F', 'Miyata Y', 'Yasuda T', 'Minami Y', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Abe A', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110110,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",,2011/01/11 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2011/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010554 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.554 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Apr 14;30(15):1822-30. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.554.

EBV-immortalized cells and EBV-induced tumours express the viral EBNA1 protein which, in addition to its roles in replicating and maintaining EBV genomes, can alter cellular processes, including the disruption of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) through the degradation of PML proteins. PML NBs are based on PML proteins and mediate several cellular processes including apoptosis, DNA repair and antiviral responses. Accordingly, EBNA1 expression decreases apoptosis and DNA repair which may contribute to malignant transformation. The ability of EBNA1 to disrupt PML NBs has recently been shown to require EBNA1 binding to two host proteins, the protein kinase CK2 and deubiquitylating protein USP7/HAUSP, both of which are known to be partially associated with PML NBs. EBNA1 increases the association of both CK2 and USP7 with PML NBs and, as a result, increases phosphorylation of PML proteins by CK2, a modification that is known to trigger PML polyubiquitylation and degradation. Recent data also implicates USP7 as a negative regulator of PML proteins and nuclear bodies by a mechanism independent of its intrinsic ubiquitin cleavage activity. The results suggest that EBNA1 usurps two host PML regulators in order to promote degradation of PML proteins and loss of PML NBs.",,"['Frappier, Lori']",['Frappier L'],"['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. lori.frappier@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110101,United States,Virulence,Virulence,101531386,"['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",IM,"['Casein Kinase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/virology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/01/11 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2011/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['14610 [pii]', '10.4161/viru.2.1.14610 [doi]']",ppublish,Virulence. 2011 Jan-Feb;2(1):58-62. doi: 10.4161/viru.2.1.14610.

Activated NOTCH (Notch(IC)) and c-MYC expression are increased in a large percentage of human T-ALL tumors. Furthermore, c-MYC has been shown to be a NOTCH target gene. Although activating mutations of Notch have been found in human T-ALL tumors, there is little evidence that the c-MYC locus is altered in this neoplasm. It was previously demonstrated that Notch and c-Myc-regulated genes have a broadly overlapping profile, including genes involved in cell cycle progression and metabolism. Given that Notch and c-Myc appear to function similarly in T-ALL, we sought to determine whether these two oncogenes could substitute for each other in T-ALL tumors. Here we report that NOTCH(IC) is able to maintain T-ALL tumors formed in the presence of exogenous NOTCH(IC) and c-MYC when exogenous c-MYC expression is extinguished. In contrast, c-MYC is incapable of maintaining these tumors in the absence of NOTCH(IC). We propose that failure of c-MYC to maintain these tumors is the result of p53-mediated apoptosis. These results demonstrate that T-ALL maintenance is dependent on NOTCH(IC), but not c-MYC, demonstrating that NOTCH is oncogenic dominant in T-ALL tumors.",,"['Demarest, Renee M', 'Dahmane, Nadia', 'Capobianco, Anthony J']","['Demarest RM', 'Dahmane N', 'Capobianco AJ']","['Molecular Oncology Program, Division of Surgical Oncology, Dewitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery and University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA083736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 83736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110107,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3062300,2011/01/11 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)43181-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-286351 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 10;117(10):2901-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-286351.

Therefore, it is important to determine their effect on the tumor growth and understand the underlying mechanisms in animal tumor models. In this study, we report a general immunotherapeutic activity of a synthetic bacterial lipoprotein (BLP), a TLR1/TLR2 agonist, on established lung carcinoma, leukemia, and melanoma in mice. Systemic treatment of 3LL tumor-bearing mice with BLP, but not LPS, led to a dose-dependent tumor regression and a long-lasting protective response against tumor rechallenge. The BLP-mediated tumor remission was neither mediated by a direct tumoricidal activity nor by innate immune cells, because it lacked therapeutic effect in immunodeficient SCID mice. Instead, BLP treatment reduced the suppressive function of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and enhanced the cytotoxicity of tumor-specific CTL in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, adoptive cotransfer of BLP-pretreated but not untreated CTL and Tregs from wild-type but not from TLR2(-/-) mice was sufficient to restore antitumor immunity in SCID mice by reciprocally modulating Treg and CTL function. These results demonstrate that the TLR1/TLR2 agonist BLP may have a general tumor therapeutic property involving reciprocal downregulation of Treg and upregulation of CTL function.

HTLV-1 encodes a nuclear localizing protein, p30, that selectively alters viral and cellular gene expression, activates G(2)-M cell cycle checkpoints, and is essential for viral spread. Here, we used immunoprecipitation and affinity pulldown of ectopically expressed p30 coupled with mass spectrometry to identify cellular binding partners of p30. Our data indicate that p30 specifically binds to cellular ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and REGgamma (a nuclear 20 S proteasome activator). Under conditions of genotoxic stress, p30 expression was associated with reduced levels of ATM and increased cell survival.

Aneuploidy of specific chromosomes has been detected in benzene-related leukemia patients as well as in healthy benzene-exposed workers, suggesting that aneuploidy precedes and may be a potential mechanism underlying benzene-induced leukemia. Here, we analyzed the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 47 exposed workers and 27 unexposed controls using a novel OctoChrome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique that simultaneously detects aneuploidy in all 24 chromosomes. Through this chromosome-wide aneuploidy study (CWAS) approach, we found heterogeneity in the monosomy and trisomy rates of the 22 autosomes when plotted against continuous benzene exposure. In addition, statistically significant, chromosome-specific increases in the rates of monosomy [5, 6, 7, 10, 16 and 19] and trisomy [5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 21 and 22] were found to be dose dependently associated with benzene exposure. Furthermore, significantly higher rates of monosomy and trisomy were observed in a priori defined 'susceptible' chromosome sets compared with all other chromosomes.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Allergic diseases are initiated by the development of allergen-specific T helper type 2 (Th2) cells and amplified by the degranulation of and cytokine release from basophils and mast cells during an effector phase. We found that Tryptanthrin could down-regulate IL-4 production by Th2 cells, while IFN-gamma production by Th1 cells was not affected. Since IL-4 produced by basophils and effector Th2 cells has been shown to play important roles in the development and amplification of Th2-dominated allergic responses, we examined the effects of Tryptanthrin on the initiation and effector phase responses of Type I allergy in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the mechanisms of Tryptanthrin-induced down-regulation of IL-4 production, the expression of Th2-specific transcription factors, c-Maf and GATA-3, was analyzed by RT-PCR. The effects of Tryptanthrin on Th cell differentiation were evaluated using CD4(+) T cells purified from spleen cells of Sugi basic protein (SBP)-immunized BALB/c mice. In primary cultures, cells were stimulated with SBP and antigen-presenting cells under neutral or Th2-skewing conditions in the presence or absence of Tryptanthrin. Cytokines produced by differentiated Th cells in secondary cultures were analyzed by ELISA. The effects of Tryptanthrin on IgE-mediated degranulation and IL-4 production were determined using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in Tryptanthrin-treated RBL-2H3 cells was analyzed to determine the mechanism of Tryptanthrin actions. RESULTS: Tryptanthrin suppressed c-Maf mRNA expression in Th2 clone cells, and even under Th2-skewing conditions, Tryptanthrin inhibited differentiation toward the Th2 phenotype, which is an essential event for the initiation phase of allergic diseases. Tryptanthrin also inhibited the IgE-mediated degranulation of and IL-4 production by RBL-2H3 cells, probably due to inhibiting IgE-mediated signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt.

To explore the potential of immunotherapy for improving clinical outcomes for these patients, we performed a phase I clinical trial of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy for elderly patients with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Autologus monocytes were obtained after reducing tumor burden by chemotherapy. Immature DCs induced with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 were pulsed with autologous apoptotic leukemic cells as antigens. DCs were administered intradermally to four patients five times at 2-week intervals. To facilitate DC migration to lymph nodes, injection sites were pretreated with killed Streptococcus pyogenes OK-432 one day before. DCs were coinjected with OK-432 to induce maturation and interleukin-12 production in vivo. RESULTS: Antileukemic responses were observed by an interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay or a tetramer assay in two of four patients. In a human leukocyte antigen-A *2402-positive patient, induction of CD8(+) T-cell responses to WT1- and human telomerase reverse transcriptase - derived peptides were observed, indicating cross-priming in vivo. The two patients with antileukemic immunity showed longer periods of disease stabilization than the other two patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the immunogenicity of autologous DCs that cross-present leukemia-associated antigens from autologous apoptotic leukemic cells in vivo in elderly patients with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Expression of PAR-1 in human leukemic cell lines is reported but the status of its expression in human leukemic patients is currently unknown. In this study we evaluated the expression pattern of PAR-1 in patients with the four main types of leukemia - chronic lymphocytic leukemia subtype B (B-CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype B (B-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Flow cytometry analyses show that lymphocytes from B-CLL patients express this receptor at similar levels to healthy individuals. On the other hand, it was observed a significant increase in PAR-1 expression in B-ALL lymphocytes as compared to B-CLL and healthy donors. Flow cytometric and real-time PCR demonstrated a significant increase in PAR-1 expression in granulocytes from CML patients in blast phase (CML-BP) but not in chronic phase (CML-CP) as compared to healthy donors. Finally, a significant increase in PAR-1 expression has been also observed in blasts from AML (subtypes M4 and M5) patients, as compared to monocytes or granulocytes from healthy donors.

Numerous natural compounds, such as gambogic acid, have been tested in vitro and in vivo as anticancer agents for cancer prevention and therapy. However, whether gambogic acid has chemosensitizing properties when combined with proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of malignant cells is still unknown. In an effort to investigate this effect, human leukemia K562 cells, mouse hepatocarcinoma H22 cells and H22 cell allografts were treated with gambogic acid, a proteasome inhibitor (MG132 or MG262) or the combination of both, followed by measurement of cellular viability, apoptosis induction and tumor growth inhibition. We report, for the first time, that: (i) the combination of natural product gambogic acid and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or MG262 results in a synergistic inhibitory effect on growth of malignant cells and tumors in allograft animal models and (ii) there was no apparent systemic toxicity observed in the animals treated with the combination.

The overall prognosis of BPDC is dismal, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 12 to 14 months despite aggressive chemotherapy. Anecdotal reports suggest that younger patients might benefit from myeloablative therapy with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). However, with a median age at diagnosis beyond 60 years, BPDC primarily affects elderly patients. Here, we present for the first time evidence that also in elderly patients, alloSCT for BPDC is feasible and may result in sustained remission if conditioning with moderately reduced intensity is used. Between 2006 and 2009, 6 patients were treated at our institution who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for BPDC. Median age was 67 (range: 55-80) years. All responded to acute leukemia-type induction therapy. Whereas 2 patients who were ineligible for alloSCT rapidly died of disease recurrence, 4 patients underwent alloSCT from unrelated donors as part of first-line (n = 1) or salvage treatment (n = 3). Two patients allografted in remission live disease free 57 and 16 months post-alloSCT, whereas 2 patients transplanted with active disease achieved complete remission but relapsed 6 and 18 months after transplantation, respectively. In conclusion, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) alloSCT from unrelated donors is feasible and seems to be effective in elderly patients with BPDC, suggesting that alloSCT should be pursued aggressively in patients with this otherwise fatal disease up to 70 years of age.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although not a common neuropathy, the clinical importance of this syndrome is its frequent association with malignancies, particularly breast cancer and lymphoma. In this paper, we present a rare case of Burkitt cell acute lymphocytic leukemia initially presenting with bilateral NCS. In this case, no abnormalities were detected on initial blood tests and radiologic investigations except for partial loss of lamina dura around mandibular teeth. Furthermore, we found no evidence of any other signs of central nervous system involvement apart from NCS. Nevertheless, the patient continued to experience severe bilateral mandibular pain and paresthesia, prompting us to repeat the blood studies. These showed lymphomatous cells, yielding the diagnosis of leukemia 37 days after the original presentation. When a patient presents with the extremely unusual symptoms of bilateral numbness of lower lip and chin, we should suspect the presence of a malignancy even in the absence of any relevant past history. If the initial radiologic investigations and blood tests reveal no abnormalities, malignancy should not be removed from the differential diagnosis until a definite cause has been found.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Mosby, Inc.

The lack of HDAC1 activity of analogues modified on the disulfide bond suggests that its cleavage must occur in cells to produce the monomeric Zn(2+)-chelating thiol. This assumption is consistent with the molecular modelling of the complex of psammaplin A thiol with h-HDAC8. Only a weak inhibition of DNMT1, DNMT3A and residual activities with SIRT1 and a p300/CBP HAT peptide were measured for these compounds.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2%-3% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in approximately 25% of bone cancers.

The infected cell protein 0 (bICP0) encoded by BHV-1 is an important regulatory protein because it is constitutively expressed and can activate all viral promoters. The mechanism by which bICP0 activates viral promoters is not well understood because bICP0 does not appear to be a sequence specific binding protein. A C(3)HC(4) zinc RING (really interesting novel gene) motif at the N-terminus of bICP0 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is important for activating viral gene expression and inhibiting interferon dependent transcription. Like other alpha-herpesvirinae ICP0 homologues, bICP0 is associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein-containing nuclear domains. During productive infection of cultured cells, BHV-1 induces degradation of the PML protein, which correlates with efficient productive infection. In this study, we demonstrated that a plasmid expressing bICP0 reduces steady state levels of the PML protein, and the C(3)HC(4) zinc RING finger is important for PML degradation. Surprisingly, bICP0 mutants with an intact C(3)HC(4) zinc RING finger that lack a nuclear localization signal also reduces steady PML protein levels. In addition, mutant bICP0 proteins that primarily localize to the cytoplasm induced morphological changes in transfected cells. During productive infection, bICP0 was detected in the cytoplasm of low-passage bovine kidney, but not established bovine kidney cells. These studies demonstrated that bICP0, even when not able to efficiently localize to the nucleus, was able to induce degradation of the PML protein and alter the morphology of transfected cells.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AREAS COVERED: mechanism of action and clinical trials of lenalidomide in CLL, and suggestions for its future utilization are reviewed. The most relevant papers and the meeting abstracts published up to July 2010 were used as sources for this review. This review will help readers understand the mechanism of action of lenalidomide and will provide a comprehensive summary regarding efficacy and safety of this drug in CLL patients. EXPERT OPINION: lenalidomide shows good activity against CLL. However, the toxicity profile is significant and can result in serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Definitive data from ongoing trials will aid better definition of its status in CLL therapy.

In this retrospective pilot study, the authors assessed the importance of postchemotherapy necrosis in high-risk neuroblastoma with a histological and case notes review of surgically resected specimens. The authors reviewed all available histology of 31 high-risk neuroblastoma cases treated with COJEC (dose intensive etoposide and vincristine with either cyclophosphamide, cisplatin or carboplatin) or OPEC/OJEC (etoposide, vincristine and cyclophosphamide with alternating cisplatin [OPEC] or carboplatin [OJEC]) induction chemotherapy in 2 Children's Cancer & Leukaemia Group (CCLG) pediatric oncology centers. The percentage of postchemotherapy necrosis was assessed and compared with MYCN amplification status and overall survival. The median percentage of postchemotherapy tumor necrosis was 60%. MYCN status was available for 28 cases, of which 12 were amplified (43%). Survival in cases with >/= 60% necrosis or >/= 90% necrosis was not better than those with less necrosis, nor was percentage necrosis associated with survival using Cox regression. However, MYCN-amplified tumors showed a higher percentage of necrosis than non-MYCN-amplified tumors, 71.3% versus 37.2% (P = .006). This effect was not related to prechemotherapy necrosis and did not confer improved overall survival. Postchemotherapy tumor necrosis is higher in patients with MYCN amplification. In this study, postchemotherapy necrosis did not correlate with overall survival and should not lead to modification of postoperative treatment. However, these findings need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma.",,"['Bomken, Simon', 'Davies, Beverley', 'Chong, Leeai', 'Cole, Michael', 'Wood, Katrina M', 'McDermott, Michael', 'Tweddle, Deborah A']","['Bomken S', 'Davies B', 'Chong L', 'Cole M', 'Wood KM', 'McDermott M', 'Tweddle DA']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110108,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2011/01/11 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2011/01/11 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2010.526684 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Mar;28(2):106-14. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2010.526684.

A comprehensive search to identify studies addressing outcome of childhood AML from India was carried out. International Society of Paediatric Oncology annual meeting abstracts were searched to identify unpublished data. Clinicodemographic and outcome data were extracted from these abstracts. Outcomes of <500 patients have been published to date, with predominantly small single-center series from 5 cities. Several AML protocols with modifications to suit the logistics in India have been used. Administration of chemotherapy (standard as well as oral and outpatient based) with manageable toxicity has been deemed feasible. Survival outcomes are modest (23% to 53.8%) except for AML M3 (over 80%), with high early-death rates, relapse, along with abandonment. Few series have identified prognostic parameters and disease burden at diagnosis, and used cytogenetics (for risk stratification) or bone marrow transplant (BMT). There is a need for assessment of risk factors in Indian patients; administration of adequate and appropriate therapy, both upfront and after relapse; improvement in supportive care; and national data management infrastructure with updating/monitoring of registries along with better financial and social support initiatives.

Over the last years evidence grew that AML is initiated and propagated by leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Conceivably, these most immature leukemia cells are more resistant to therapy and subsequently initiate relapse. The authors studied 17 patients with childhood AML treated according to the AML-BFM 98/04 protocol. At diagnosis, the authors determined the characteristic immunophenotype of the leukemic cells by flow cytometry and investigated the expression of CD34, CD38, and CD45 to define a population of immunophenotypically immature cells (CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low)) enriched for LSCs in many cases of AML. The authors compared the fraction of this population of all myeloid cells at diagnosis with event-free survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant higher event free survival of patients with low CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low) cell proportion (<0.68%) compared to patients with high burden of this population (>0.83%; log-rank P < .04). This correlation was not found for the total number of CD34(+) cells. This is the first study to show that a higher proportion of immature CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low) blasts at diagnosis correlates with unfavorable prognosis in childhood AML. The results suggest that a large CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low) population reflects a higher fraction of LSCs, leading to increased chemotherapy resistance and elevated relapse rate. Thus the initial frequency of CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD45(-/low) cells may serve as a prognostic marker in pediatric AML.

The seroprevalence of anti-HBs was 29.9% among patients, and 20.6% among controls. This difference was also found to be statistically significant.

A higher prevalence of IgG and IgM markers specific for CMV (96.2% and 12% for patients; 91.6% and 8% for controls), and for EBV (88.3% and 26.5% for patients; 75.1% and 13.4% for controls), were detected among leukemic patients than controls, while none of the patients and controls were positive for HIV I and II markers. CONCLUSION: We conclude that HBV, HCV, CMV, and EBV infections are more prevalent among leukemic patients. There was an increase in the seropositivity rates of HCV, CMV, and EBV infections with increasing ages of leukemic patients. The male leukemic patients were more exposed to HBV, HCV, and EBV infections than females.",,"['Omer, Ali R', 'Salih, Jalil I', 'Al-Nakshabandi, Abdulkader A']","['Omer AR', 'Salih JI', 'Al-Nakshabandi AA']","['Central Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Iraq.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood', 'Hepatitis C/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Viremia/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/01/08 06:00,2011/04/29 06:00,['2011/01/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","[""0' [pii]""]",ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2011 Jan;32(1):55-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD38 has a genetic polymorphism, with a C --> G variation in a putative E-box located in a regulatory region. E2A, the predominant E-box factor in B lymphocytes, was found to be highly expressed by CD38(+) CLL patients. The highest CD38 levels scored by E2A(+)/G carrier patients suggested that E2A is (i) directly associated with CD38 expression, and that (ii) the binding of the transcription factor is influenced by the CD38 genotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that E2A directly interacts with the CD38 regulatory region. Furthermore, E2A binding was stronger in the presence of the G allele. Experiments of E2A silencing led to a significant reduction of surface levels of CD38, confirming the working hypothesis. A direct functional interplay between E2A and CD38 was shown by exposing CLL cells to interleukin-2 and TLR-9 ligands, both inducers of CD38 expression. Under these conditions, CD38 upregulation was primarily conditioned by the presence of E2A and then by the G allele.

In this study, we evaluated its effects on primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples (n=87). In vitro exposure to SNS-032 for 48 h resulted in a mean LD(50) of 139+/-203 nM; Cytarabine (Ara-C) was more than 35 times less potent in the same cohort. SNS-032-induced a dose-dependent increase in annexin V staining and caspase-3 activation. At the molecular level, SNS-032 induced a marked dephosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II and inhibited the expression of CDK2 and CDK9 and dephosphorylated CDK7. Furthermore, the combination of SNS-032 and Ara-C showed remarkable synergy that was associated with reduced mRNA levels of the antiapoptotic genes XIAP, BCL2 and MCL1. In conclusion, SNS-032 is effective as a single agent and in combination with Ara-C in primary AML blasts. Treatment with Ara-C alone significantly induced the transcription of the antiapoptotic genes BCL2 and XIAP. In contrast, the combination of SNS-032 and Ara-C suppressed the transcription of BCL2, XIAP and MCL1.

The leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) level was assayed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cell line. ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were used for in vivo assays. Mouse ear edema was induced by topical application of arachidonic acid. An air pouch was induced by subcutaneous injection of sterile air into mice, followed by zymosan treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for pharmacokinetic studies. RESULTS: KRH-102140 inhibited 5-LO activity with an IC(50) value of 160 +/- 23 nmol/l in parallel with LTB(4) inhibition in RBL-1 cells. Oral administration of KRH-102140 (10-100 mg/kg) reduced ear edema, myeloperoxidase activity and LTB(4) production in murine inflammation models. Oral bioavailability as determined in rats was 66%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of two multinational, randomized trials in CLL patients comparing rituximab combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide versus FC were reviewed. The primary endpoint of both studies was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The addition of rituximab to FC decreased the risk of a PFS event by 44% in 817 previously untreated patients and by 24% in 552 previously treated patients. Median survival times could not be estimated. Exploratory analysis in patients older than 70 suggested that there was no benefit to patients when rituximab was added to FC. The safety profile observed in both trials was consistent with the known toxicity profile of rituximab, FC, or CLL.

The apparent failure in AML likely reflects a lack of biological understanding that might clarify applications of proteosome inhibitors in this disease. Here we show that AML cells are considerably less sensitive than control noncancerous cells to bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity, permitting most bortezomib-treated AML cells to survive treatment. We traced reduced bortezomib sensitivity to increased basal levels of nuclear Nrf2, a transcription factor that stimulates protective antioxidant enzymes. Bortezomib stimulates cytotoxicity through accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but elevated basal levels of nuclear Nrf2 present in AML cells reduced ROS levels, permitting AML cells to survive drug treatment. We further found that the Nrf2 transcriptional repressor Bach1 is rapidly inactivated by bortezomib, allowing rapid induction of Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective and detoxification genes that protect AML cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis. By contrast, nonmalignant control cells lacked constitutive activation of Nrf2, such that bortezomib-mediated inactivation of Bach1 led to a delay in induction of Nrf2-regulated genes, effectively preventing the manifestation of apoptotic protection that is seen in AML cells. Together, our findings argue that AML might be rendered sensitive to proteasome inhibitors by cotreatment with either an Nrf2-inhibitory or Bach1-inhibitory treatment, rationalizing a targeted therapy against AML.",['(c)2011 AACR.'],"['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'Bowles KM', 'MacEwan DJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['09-0014/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110106,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BACH1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/01/08 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2011/01/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-3018 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Mar 1;71(5):1999-2009. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3018.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained, from September 2004 to October 2007, 51 patients (29 women, 22 men; mean age, 43.5 years; range, 17-66 years) agreed to undergo DCE MR imaging to assess bone marrow perfusion, among 96 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML who had received induction chemotherapy and achieved CR. Two semiquantitative parameters (peak and slope) and another three quantitative parameters (amplitude, K(ep) [efflux rate constant], and K(el) [elimination rate constant]) were calculated. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier model, while differences between patient groups with high and low DCE MR imaging parameter values were assessed by using the two-sided log-rank test. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 25.9 months. Univariate analysis results showed that high values of peak (>/=0.42), slope (>/=0.0235), amplitude (>/=0.03), and K(ep) (>/=0.0082) were associated with shorter OS (P = .004, 0.01, 0.034, and 0.026, respectively). Besides, a high value of K(ep) was also associated with shorter RFS (P = .008). When age, sex, and initial karyotype at diagnosis were included in multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the results showed that only K(ep), but not other DCE MR imaging parameters, was an independent factor for OS (relative risk [RR], 30.305; P = .021) and RFS (RR, 6.477; P = .009). CONCLUSION: Bone marrow perfusion measured with DCE MR imaging in AML patients in CR can be an indicator of outcome and survival. K(ep) measured with kinetic modeling was useful and significantly associated with RFS, while heuristic parameters (peak and slope) were not.","['(c) RSNA, 2011.']","['Chen, Bang-Bin', 'Hsu, Chao-Yu', 'Yu, Chih-Wei', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Wei, Shwu-Yuan', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Shih, Tiffany Ting-Fang']","['Chen BB', 'Hsu CY', 'Yu CW', 'Hou HA', 'Liu CY', 'Wei SY', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF', 'Shih TT']","['Department of Medical Imaging and Radiology, Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, No. 7 Chung-Shan S.

Targeting such alterations, therefore, may lead to cancer prevention. By crossing our previously established phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten)-null acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model onto the recombination-activating gene 1(-/-) background, we show that the lack of variable, diversity and joining [V(D)J] recombination completely abolishes the Tcralpha/delta-c-myc translocation and T-ALL development, regardless of beta-catenin activation. We identify mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a regulator of beta-selection. Rapamycin, an mTOR-specific inhibitor, alters nutrient sensing and blocks T-cell differentiation from CD4(-)CD8(-) to CD4(+)CD8(+), the stage where the Tcralpha/delta-c-myc translocation occurs. Long-term rapamycin treatment of preleukemic Pten-null mice prevents Tcralpha/delta-c-myc translocation and leukemia stem cell (LSC) formation, and it halts T-ALL development. However, rapamycin alone fails to inhibit mTOR signaling in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) population enriched for LSCs and eliminate these cells.

However, little is known about the regulation of the two other p53-family members, p63 and p73, by nitrogen oxides. We report here an up-regulation of p73 by NO in p53-null K-562 leukemia cells. Chemical NO prodrugs or macrophage iNOS activity induced an accumulation of the TAp73alpha isoform in these cells, whereas macrophages from iNOS(-/-) mice did not. NO also up-regulated TAp73 mRNA expression, suggesting a transcriptional regulation. The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 can regulate TAp73 induction after DNA damage. We show that these kinases were rapidly phosphorylated upon NO treatment. Genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 impaired NO-mediated accumulation of TAp73alpha. Because NO is known to block DNA synthesis through ribonucleotide reductase inhibition, the up-regulation of TAp73alpha might be caused by DNA damage induced by an arrest of DNA replication forks. In support of this hypothesis, DNA replication inhibitors such as hydroxyurea and aphidicolin similarly enhanced TAp73alpha expression and Chk1 phosphorylation. Moreover, inhibition of Chk1 also prevented TAp73alpha accumulation in response to replication inhibitors.

Studies in experimental animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) provided evidence for both pathologic and protective effects of NK cells. Humans harbor two functionally distinct NK-cell subsets exerting either predominantly cytotoxic (CD56(dim)CD16(+)) or immunoregulatory (CD56(bright)CD16(-)) functions. We analyzed these two subsets and their functions in the peripheral blood of untreated patients with relapsing-remitting MS compared with healthy blood donors. While ex vivo frequencies of CD56(bright)CD16(-) and CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells were similar in patients and controls, we found that cytokine-driven in vitro accumulation and IFN-gamma production of CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cells but not of their CD56(dim)CD16(+) counterparts were substantially diminished in MS. Impaired expansion of CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cells was cell intrinsic because the observed effects could be reproduced with purified NK cells in an independent cohort of patients and controls. In contrast, cytolytic NK-cell activity toward the human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell line K562, the allogeneic CD4(+) T cell line CEM and allogeneic primary CD4(+) T-cell blasts was unchanged.

However, the signaling pathways that trigger their transition from self-renewal to differentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that calcineurin-NFAT signaling is both necessary and sufficient to switch ESCs from an undifferentiated state to lineage-specific cells and that the inhibition of this pathway can maintain long-term ESC self-renewal independent of leukemia inhibitory factor. Mechanistically, this pathway converges with the Erk1/2 pathway to regulate Src expression and promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process required for lineage specification in response to differentiation stimuli. Furthermore, calcineurin-NFAT signaling is activated when the earliest differentiation event occurs in mouse embryos, and its inhibition disrupts extraembryonic lineage development. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the NFAT and Erk1/2 cascades form a signaling switch for early lineage segregation in mouse ESCs and provide significant insights into the regulation of the balance between ESC self-renewal and early lineage specification.",['Copyright A(c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of eleven patients with CMPD complicating pregnancy hospitalized in Peking University People's Hospital from 2000 to 2009, including five patients with essential thrombocythemia, one with primary myelofibrosis and five with chronic myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: (1) Five pregnancies had periodic antenatal care and laboratory monitorings like full blood count. Reasonable anti-coagulation therapy was given to prevent the complications. One patient with PMF diagnosed before conception had her first pregnancy ended with mild pre-eclampsia and intrauterine death at the gestational age of 32 weeks. During the first trimester of her second pregnancy two years later, the test for anti-beta2 glycoprotein antibody was positive. She received low-dose aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin as anti-coagulants. An uneventful course was obtained and she delivered a healthy term infant. (2) Five pregnancies had occasional antenatal examination, including two patients with ET and three patients with CML. One patient with ET developed severe pre-eclampsia at the gestational age of 25 weeks. Umbilical artery Doppler showed reversed end-diastolic velocity. The management with anti-convulsants, anti-hypertensives and anti-coagulants showed no effect. An emergency cesarean section had to be performed because of the aggressive hypertension and placental abruption, with still birth as a result. Two pregnancies never had an antenatal care. Both of them were admitted on labor and the diagnoses of CML were made. (3) Four pregnancies developed oligohydramnios and three developed preelampsia (two severe pre-eclampsia and one mild pre-eclampsia). There was no other hemorrhage and thrombosis event. (4) Eight pregnancies reached full-term with four cesarean sections and four vaginal births. Two preterm cesarean sections were performed because of a progressive oligohydramnios. The ten live neonates weighed 1820 - 3600 g. All were appropriate for gestational age, except one fetal growth retardation (FGR) developed in one patient with severe pre-eclampsia. (5) As for the CMPD, the eleven patients were all in stable conditions. Three patients with CML received hydroxyurea in the third trimester, four with ET and one with CML had platelet-pheresis before delivery with favorable effect. All patients were uneventful postpartum, except one with CML who died in 5 months after childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy outcomes for patients with CMPD are mostly good. However, antenatal care should pay more attention to the complications such as thromboembolic accidents, pre-eclampsia, still birth and fetal growth retardation. Management including reasonable anti-coagulation therapy should be considered, which may help improve the prognosis.",,"['Bai, Yue-Ting', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Wang, Jian-Liu', 'Liang, Mei-Ying', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hong']","['Bai YT', 'Zhang C', 'Wang JL', 'Liang MY', 'Zhang XH']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,16210370R,,IM,"['Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', '*Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third']",,2011/01/08 06:00,2016/04/24 06:00,['2011/01/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi. 2010 Dec;45(12):896-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty newly diagnosed MDS (17 in low risk and 33 in high risk), 8 acute myeloid leukemia preceded by MDS (MDS-AML) and 25 normal controls were enrolled into this study. Their CD(34)(+)CD(38)(+), CD(34)(+)CD(38)(-) bone marrow cells and bone marrow cell cycle were measured with flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mean percentages of CD(34)(+) cells in bone marrow karyocyte of high risk [(2.29 +/- 2.17)%] and MDS-AML groups [(18.69 +/- 17.47)%] were significantly higher than that of control group [(0.36 +/- 0.49)%, P < 0.05]. The mean percentages of CD(34)(+)CD(38)(+) cells were significantly lower in low risk, high risk and MDS-AML groups [(86.09 +/- 7.79)%, (81.68 +/- 11.82)% and (82.88 +/- 2.60)%, respectively] than that in control group [(92.21 +/- 3.85)%, P < 0.05], thus the percentages of CD(34)(+)CD(38)(-) cells were significantly higher in either MDS (low risk and high risk) or MDS-AML groups [(13.91 +/- 7.79)%, (18.32 +/- 11.82)% or (17.13 +/- 2.60)%, respectively] than that in control group [(7.79 +/- 3.85)%, P < 0.05]. The percentages of CD(34)(+)CD(38)(-) cells of MDS cases correlated directly with their International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (r = 0.493, P = 0.001) and WHO Adapted Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) (r = 0.586, P = 0.000) scores. The percentages of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) in G(0)/G(1) phase of in low risk, high risk and MDS-AML groups [(94.52 +/- 4.32)%, (96.07 +/- 3.88)% and (94.65 +/- 4.55)%, respectively] were significantly higher than that in control group [(88.94 +/- 7.30)%, P < 0.01], thus the percentages of BMMNCs in S and G(2)/M phase were significantly lower in either MDS (low risk and high risk) or MDS-AML groups than that in control group (P < 0.05). MDS patients with low percentages of CD(34)(+)CD(38)(-) cells presented higher therapeutic efficacy than those with high percentages of CD(34)(+)CD(38)(-) cells, while without significant differences (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There are abnormalities of differentiation of CD(34)(+) bone marrow cells and high proportion of G(0)/G(1) cells which indicates a G(1) phase arrest in MDS that might be involved in the pathogenesis of MDS.

Interview and observational data were compared and contrasted with key constructs in behavioral decision theory to analyze theoretical utility and fit. Decision making involved a complex interplay among the patient, treating clinicians, and family members. While some constructs of decision theory, such as trade-offs, avoidance-avoidance, and the certainty effect, showed utility for decision making in geriatric oncology, this case demonstrated that individual preferences for treatment may be expressed in quality of life preferences rather than a specific treatment decision. The Cage, a major theme in this case, represented the trap of two undesirable choices in treatment decision making, as well as the imprisoning consequence of aggressive medical treatment for advanced cancer. Further decision making research is needed to develop practice-level theory that can more effectively support and guide treatment decision making in geriatric oncology.","['Copyright 2011, SLACK Incorporated.']","['Crighton, Margaret H', 'Lingler, Jennifer H', 'Happ, Mary Beth']","['Crighton MH', 'Lingler JH', 'Happ MB']","['Department of acute and Tertiary Care, Department of Health and Community System, University of Pittsburg School of Nursing, Pittsburg, PA 15261, USA. mhapp@pitt.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101229,United States,Res Gerontol Nurs,Research in gerontological nursing,101392499,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Decision Theory', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy']",,2011/01/08 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2011/01/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/19404921-20101201-03 [doi]'],ppublish,Res Gerontol Nurs. 2011 Jan;4(1):27-35. doi: 10.3928/19404921-20101201-03.

Survival of CLL cells depends on their close contact with stromal cells in lymphatic tissues, bone marrow and blood. This microenvironmental regulation of CLL cell survival involves the stromal secretion of chemo- and cytokines as well as the expression of adhesion molecules. Since CLL survival may also be driven by antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), we explored the hypothesis that these processes may be linked to each other. We tested if stromal cells could serve as an antigen reservoir for CLL cells, thus promoting CLL cell survival by stimulation through the BCR. As a proof of principle, we found that two CLL BCRs with a common stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (previously characterized as ""subset 1"") recognize antigens highly expressed in stromal cells--vimentin and calreticulin. Both antigens are well-documented targets of autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders. We demonstrated that vimentin is displayed on the surface of viable stromal cells and that it is present and bound by the stereotyped CLL BCR in CLL-stroma co-culture supernatant. Blocking the vimentin antigen by recombinant soluble CLL BCR under CLL-stromal cell co-culture conditions reduces stroma-mediated anti-apoptotic effects by 20-45%. We therefore conclude that CLL BCR stimulation by stroma-derived antigens can contribute to the protective effect that the stroma exerts on CLL cells.

This study describes the novel observation that in addition to Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, primary patient cells also express Hypoxia Inducible Factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha) and Vascular Endothelial Cadherin (VE-cadherin), which are regulated by Abl kinase. Tumor expression of the classical endothelial protein, VE-cadherin, has been associated with aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in other models, but has not been investigated in hematopoietic malignancies. Targeted knockdown of VE-cadherin rendered Ph+ ALL cells more susceptible to chemotherapy, even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) derived survival cues. Pre-treatment of Ph+ ALL cells with ADH100191, a VE-cadherin antagonist, resulted in increased apoptosis during in vitro chemotherapy exposure. Consistent with a role for VE-cadherin in modulation of leukemia cell viability, lentiviral-mediated expression of VE-cadherin in Ph- ALL cells resulted in increased resistance to treatment-induced apoptosis. These observations suggest a novel role for VE-cadherin in modulation of chemoresistance in Ph+ ALL.",,"[""O'Leary, Heather"", 'Akers, Stephen M', 'Piktel, Debra', 'Walton, Cheryl', 'Fortney, James E', 'Martin, Karen H', 'Craig, Michael', 'Coad, James', 'Gibson, Laura F']","[""O'Leary H"", 'Akers SM', 'Piktel D', 'Walton C', 'Fortney JE', 'Martin KH', 'Craig M', 'Coad J', 'Gibson LF']",,['eng'],"['P20 RR016440/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056888/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR020866/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20100302,Netherlands,Cancer Microenviron,Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society,101322634,,,,PMC2990486,2011/01/07 06:00,2011/01/07 06:01,['2011/01/07 06:00'],"['2009/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12307-010-0035-6 [doi]'],epublish,Cancer Microenviron. 2010 Mar 2;3(1):67-81. doi: 10.1007/s12307-010-0035-6.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr/Abl', 'Bone marrow stromal cells', 'HIF-2alpha', 'Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+)', 'VE-cadherin']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about possible cofactors that regulate VEGF receptor expression and activation on leukemia cells. Here we show that cholesterol accumulates in leukemia-rich sites within bone marrow of xenotransplanted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that cholesterol-rich domains might regulate FLT-1 signaling and chemotaxis of acute leukemias. We then showed that FLT-1 accumulates in discrete cholesterol-rich membrane domains where it associates with caveolin-1 and that placenta growth factor (PlGF)/VEGF stimulation promotes FLT-1 localization in such cholesterol-rich domains. Accordingly, FLT-1 localization and its phosphorylation are abrogated by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD), which removes cellular cholesterol, and by nystatin, an inhibitor of lipid-raft endocytosis. Mechanistically, cholesterol increases FLT-1 expression and promotes PlGF/VEGF-induced leukemia cells viability and also induces VEGF production by the leukemia cells in vitro. Taken together, we conclude that cholesterol regulates VEGF:VEGFR-1 signaling on subsets of acute leukemias, modulating cell migration, and viability, which may be crucial for disease progression. Finally, we provide evidence obtained from human AML samples that primary leukemia cells accumulate significantly more cholesterol than do normal cells and that cholesterol accumulation correlates with disease aggressiveness.",,"['Casalou, Cristina', 'Costa, Ana', 'Carvalho, Tania', 'Gomes, Ana L', 'Zhu, Zhenping', 'Wu, Yan', 'Dias, Sergio']","['Casalou C', 'Costa A', 'Carvalho T', 'Gomes AL', 'Zhu Z', 'Wu Y', 'Dias S']","['Angiogenesis Group, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia Franscisco Gentil de Lisboa, EPE (CIPM/IPOLFG), Lisbon 1099-023, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110105,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (PGF protein, human)', '0 (Pgf protein, mouse)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '144589-93-5 (Placenta Growth Factor)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Caveolin 1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Placenta Growth Factor', 'Pregnancy Proteins/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/01/07 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0155 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0155 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Feb;9(2):215-24. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0155.

Here, a new approach has been created for heterologous enzyme deimmunization whereby combinatorial saturation mutagenesis is coupled with a screening strategy that capitalizes on the evolutionary biology concept of neutral drift, and combined with iterative computational prediction of T-cell epitopes to achieve extensive reengineering of a protein sequence for reduced MHC-II binding propensity without affecting catalytic and pharmacological properties. Escherichia coli L-asparaginase II (EcAII), the only nonhuman enzyme approved for repeated administration, is critical in treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but elicits adverse antibody responses in a significant fraction of patients. The neutral drift screening of combinatorial saturation mutagenesis libraries at a total of 12 positions was used to isolate an EcAII variant containing eight amino acid substitutions within computationally predicted T-cell epitopes--of which four were nonconservative--while still exhibiting k(cat)/K(M) = 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) for L-Asn hydrolysis. Further, immunization of HLA-transgenic mice expressing the ALL-associated DRB1*0401 allele with the engineered variant resulted in significantly reduced T-cell responses and a 10-fold reduction in anti-EcAII IgG titers relative to the existing therapeutic. This significant reduction in the immunogenicity of EcAII may be clinically relevant for ALL treatment and illustrates the potential of employing neutral drift screens to achieve large jumps in sequence space as may be required for the deimmunization of heterologous proteins.",,"['Cantor, Jason R', 'Yoo, Tae Hyeon', 'Dixit, Aakanksha', 'Iverson, Brent L', 'Forsthuber, Thomas G', 'Georgiou, George']","['Cantor JR', 'Yoo TH', 'Dixit A', 'Iverson BL', 'Forsthuber TG', 'Georgiou G']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA139059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM065551/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM065551/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110105,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (HLA-DRB1*04:01 antigen)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Drift', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Humans', 'Immunization/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Library', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",PMC3029727,2011/01/07 06:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2011/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1014739108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1014739108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 25;108(4):1272-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1014739108.

We have shown recently that Tax can drastically upregulate the expression of p27(Kip1) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) through protein stabilization and mRNA trans-activation and stabilization, respectively. The Tax-induced surge in p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(Kip1) begins in S phase and results in cellular senescence. Importantly, HeLa and SupT1 T cells infected by HTLV-1 also arrest in senescence, thus challenging the notion that HTLV-1 infection causes cell proliferation. Here we use time-lapse microscopy to investigate the effect of Tax on cell cycle progression in two reporter cell lines, HeLa/18x21-EGFP and HeLa-FUCCI, that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of 18 copies of the Tax-responsive 21-bp repeat element and fluorescent ubiquitin cell cycle indicators, respectively. Tax-expressing HeLa cells exhibit elongated or stalled cell cycle phases. Many of them bypass mitosis and become single senescent cells as evidenced by the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. Such cells have twice the normal equivalent of cellular contents and hence are enlarged, with exaggerated nuclei. Interestingly, nocodazole treatment revealed a small variant population of HeLa/18x21-EGFP cells that could progress into mitosis normally with high levels of Tax expression, suggesting that genetic or epigenetic changes that prevent Tax-induced senescence can occur spontaneously at a detectable frequency.",,"['Yang, Liangpeng', 'Kotomura, Naoe', 'Ho, Yik-Khuan', 'Zhi, Huijun', 'Bixler, Sandra', 'Schell, Michael J', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Yang L', 'Kotomura N', 'Ho YK', 'Zhi H', 'Bixler S', 'Schell MJ', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd., Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA115884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019083/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '1S10RR019083/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA115884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110105,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Video']",PMC3067921,2011/01/07 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2011/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00086-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00086-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Mar;85(6):3001-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00086-10.

We examined CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses to HBZ and compared these with Tax responses. METHOD: Interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2-secreting T cells were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with synthetic HBZ or Tax peptides. Ten patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and 20 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs), (10 high, 10 low viral load). RESULTS: Of 30 study participants, 17 had detectable HBZ-specific CD4+ T cells and 12 had HBZ-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Detection of Tax-specific CD4+ T cells (IL-2- or IFN-gamma-secreting) did not differ by disease status, but Tax-specific CD8+ T cell responses were more commonly detected in patients with HAM. HBZ-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were less likely to be detected than Tax-specific T cells. IL-2-secreting Tax-specific CD8+ T cells, and IFN-gamma-secreting Tax-specific CD4+ T cells were associated with HAM. Low viral load, asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriage was associated with IL-2-secreting CD8+ T cells specific for HBZ. CONCLUSION: HBZ protein is expressed in vivo in patients with HAM and in ACs. Our results are consistent with the idea that the T cell response to HBZ plays an important part in restricting HTLV-1 viral load.",,"['Hilburn, Silva', 'Rowan, Aileen', 'Demontis, Maria-Antonietta', 'MacNamara, Aidan', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Bangham, Charles R M', 'Taylor, Graham P']","['Hilburn S', 'Rowan A', 'Demontis MA', 'MacNamara A', 'Asquith B', 'Bangham CR', 'Taylor GP']","['Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Norfolk Place, London, England.']",['eng'],"['G0401616/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0601072/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G041616/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110105,United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*immunology', 'Blood/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",PMC3071236,2011/01/07 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2011/01/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jiq078 [pii]', '10.1093/infdis/jiq078 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2011 Feb 15;203(4):529-36. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiq078.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) were performed to measure serum Ig paraprotein. The correlations between serum Ig paraprotein and other prognostic factors were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to assess associations between survival time and potential risk factors. In 133 Chinese CLL patients, 27 (20.3%) patients occurred Ig paraproteinemia at diagnosis. According to the correlation analysis, advanced Binet stage (r=0.314, P<0.001), direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-positive (r=0.366, P<0.001), high level of serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) (r=0.296, P=0.001) and thymidine kinase (TK) 1 (r=0.227, P=0.037), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) status (r=0.284, P=0.002), ZAP-70-positive (r=0.305, P=0.001), CD38-positive (r=0.284, P=0.002), and cytogenetic abnormalities of del(17p13) or del(11q22.3) (r=0.208, P=0.032) emerged as factors significantly related to the occurrence of Ig paraproteinemia. Survival analysis showed that the patients with Ig paraproteinemia had significantly shorter survival times than the patients without serum Ig paraprotein (P=0.013). Binet stage (P=0.028), high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.004), IgG paraproteinemia (P=0.048), IgM paraproteinemia (P=0.001), ZAP-70-positive (P=0.003), DAT-positive (P=0.013), unmutated IGHV status (P=0.009), and del(17p13) (P=0.001) were the adverse factors in determining overall survival (OS).

Considering the long-term effects, it is expected that astrocyte-conditioned medium is a major regulator of gene expression in oligodendrocytes even in the absence of cytosol-to-cytosol communication via astrocyte-oligodendrocyte gap junction channels. Indeed, by comparing the transcriptomes of immortalized precursor oligodendrocyte (Oli-neu) cells when cultured alone and co-cultured with non-touching astrocytes we found profound changes in the gene expression level, control and networking. Remarkably, the astrocyte proximity was more effective in remodeling the myelination (MYE) gene fabric and its control by cytokine receptor (CYR)-modulated intercellular Ca2+-signaling (ICS) transcriptomic network than the dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) treatment-induced transformation into myelin-associated glycoprotein-positive oligodendrocyte-like cells. Moreover, astrocyte proximity up-regulated 37 MYE genes and switched on another 14 MYE, 23 ICS and 4 CYR genes, enhancing the roles of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and connexins Cx29 and Cx47.

The quantification of levels of p-JAK2 by IHC was well correlated with that assessed by Western blot analyses and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Levels of p-JAK2 were directly correlated with high white blood cell count (52.3 x 10(3) /L in patients with high p-JAK2 vs. 28.3 x 10(3) /L in patients with low p-JAK2, p < 0.01) and were inversely correlated with complete remission rates (45% in patients with high p-JAK2 vs. 78% in patients with low p-JAK2, p < 0.003). In addition, multivariate analysis confirmed that high levels of p-JAK2 remained a significant factor for overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.213; 95% confidence interval, 1.212-4.041, p = 0.023). Moreover, we found that AZ960, a novel and specific inhibitor of the JAK2 kinase, potently inhibited the clonogenic growth and induced apoptosis of freshly isolated AML cells from patients in association with cleavage of caspase 3 and downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL proteins.

In early studies, we showed that the level of IL-3Rbeta expression was lower in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) than healthy donors and patients in complete remission by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). With the differentiation of cells, enhanced expression of IL-3Rbeta was also observed in all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced NB4 cells. To unravel the role of IL-3Rbeta upregulation in NB4 cells induced with ATRA, we knocked down IL-3Rbeta expression by RNA interference (RNAi). Knockdown of IL-3Rbeta resulted in decreased proliferation in NB4 cells induced with or without ATRA, observed by cell growth curves, colony formation assays and cell cycle analysis. Surface expression of CD11b antigen and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assays were also carried out at different time points. However, no significant difference was observed between the experimental and control groups treated with ATRA. Other findings suggested that IL-3Ralpha was decreased in NB4-IL-3Rbeta shRNA cells by western blot. Down-regulation of IL-3Rbeta also caused a decrease in PML/RARalpha expression detected with RT-qPCR. Together, these results suggest that abnormalities of IL-3Rbeta expression were observed in APL; knockdown of IL-3Rbeta inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells with or without ATRA, but no effect was detected in the cellular differentiation.

We found that the case of 19 patients had evolved to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), while 21 patients (two of them with concurrent MDS) developed paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The cumulative incidence of clonal evolutions was assessed as 3.7%, whereas the incidences of MDS/AML and PNH were 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, at 5 years. By multivariate analysis, age, severity of the disease, and the number of days of rhuG-CSF therapy were the risk factors for AA evolution to MDS/AML. The relative risk (RR) for very severe AA was approximately seven times higher than that for severe AA (SAA) and non-SAA (NSAA) (P = 0.001), but the latter two did not differ significantly (P = 0.743). PNH clone was monitored sequentially in 237 patients; positive clones were detected in 41% of the patients, but more than half of them were transient or instable. White blood cell count at initial diagnosis was identified as the only significant risk factor for AA evolution to PNH (P = 0.007). Our results suggest that the transformation to PNH for subpopulations of AA patients may be natural evolution as the clinical manifestation and pathogenesis between AA and PNH were closely related. Furthermore, normalizing hematopoiesis of AA may represent a viable approach to prevent clone evolutions, especially to MDS/AML.",,"['Li, Yingmei', 'Li, Xingxin', 'Ge, Meili', 'Shi, Jun', 'Qian, Linsheng', 'Zheng, Yizhou', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Li Y', 'Li X', 'Ge M', 'Shi J', 'Qian L', 'Zheng Y', 'Wang J']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110105,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2011/01/06 06:00,2011/06/04 06:00,['2011/01/06 06:00'],"['2009/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1140-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 May;90(5):529-37. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1140-9.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the microRNA miR-15a/miR-16-1 cluster (located at 13q), tumor protein p53 (TP53, located at 17p), and miR-34b/miR-34c cluster (located at 11q) are linked in a molecular pathway that explains the pathogenetic and prognostic implications (indolent vs aggressive form) of recurrent 13q, 17p, and 11q deletions in CLL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: CLL Research Consortium institutions provided blood samples from untreated patients (n = 206) diagnosed with B-cell CLL between January 2000 and April 2008. All samples were evaluated for the occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities as well as the expression levels of the miR-15a/miR-16-1 cluster, miR-34b/miR-34c cluster, TP53, and zeta-chain (TCR)-associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP70), a surrogate prognostic marker of CLL. The functional relationship between these genes was studied using in vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cell lines and primary samples and was validated in a separate cohort of primary CLL samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytogenetic abnormalities; expression levels of the miR-15a/miR-16-1 cluster, miR-34 family, TP53 gene, downstream effectors cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1) (CDKN1A) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 binding component 3 (BBC3), and ZAP70 gene; genetic interactions detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: In CLLs with 13q deletions the miR-15a/miR-16-1 cluster directly targeted TP53 (mean luciferase activity for miR-15a vs scrambled control, 0.68 relative light units (RLU) [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.63-0.73]; P = .02; mean for miR-16 vs scrambled control, 0.62 RLU [95% CI, 0.59-0.65]; P = .02) and its downstream effectors. In leukemic cell lines and primary CLL cells, TP53 stimulated the transcription of miR-15/miR-16-1 as well as miR-34b/miR-34c clusters, and the miR-34b/miR-34c cluster directly targeted the ZAP70 kinase (mean luciferase activity for miR-34a vs scrambled control, 0.33 RLU [95% CI, 0.30-0.36]; P = .02; mean for miR-34b vs scrambled control, 0.31 RLU [95% CI, 0.30-0.32]; P = .01; and mean for miR-34c vs scrambled control, 0.35 RLU [95% CI, 0.33-0.37]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: A microRNA/TP53 feedback circuitry is associated with CLL pathogenesis and outcome. This mechanism provides a novel pathogenetic model for the association of 13q deletions with the indolent form of CLL that involves microRNAs, TP53, and ZAP70.",,"['Fabbri, Muller', 'Bottoni, Arianna', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Spizzo, Riccardo', 'Nicoloso, Milena S', 'Rossi, Simona', 'Barbarotto, Elisa', 'Cimmino, Amelia', 'Adair, Brett', 'Wojcik, Sylwia E', 'Valeri, Nicola', 'Calore, Federica', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Fanini, Francesca', 'Vannini, Ivan', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', ""Dell'Aquila, Marie"", 'Alder, Hansjuerg', 'Davuluri, Ramana V', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Amadori, Dino', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Calin, George A', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Fabbri M', 'Bottoni A', 'Shimizu M', 'Spizzo R', 'Nicoloso MS', 'Rossi S', 'Barbarotto E', 'Cimmino A', 'Adair B', 'Wojcik SE', 'Valeri N', 'Calore F', 'Sampath D', 'Fanini F', 'Vannini I', 'Musuraca G', ""Dell'Aquila M"", 'Alder H', 'Davuluri RV', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Negrini M', 'Nakamura T', 'Amadori D', 'Kay NE', 'Rai KR', 'Keating MJ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Calin GA', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA129242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111953/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/physiology']",PMC3690301,2011/01/06 06:00,2011/01/08 06:00,['2011/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['305/1/59 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2010.1919 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2011 Jan 5;305(1):59-67. doi: 10.1001/jama.2010.1919.,,['NIHMS463100'],,,,,,"['JAMA. 2011 Jan 5;305(1):95-7.

We previously discovered that 2 of these receptors, NR4A1 and NR4A3, are potent tumor suppressors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); they are silenced in human AML, and abrogation of both genes in mice leads to rapid postnatal development of AML. Reduced expression of NR4As is also a common feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Here we show that reduced gene dosage of NR4A1 and NR4A3 in hypoallelic (NR4A1(+/-)NR4A3(-/-) or NR4A1(-/-)NR4A3(+/-)) mice below a critical threshold leads to a chronic myeloid malignancy that closely recapitulates the pathologic features of mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs) with progression to AML in rare cases. Enhanced proliferation and excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors, together with elevated DNA damage, contribute to MDS/MPN disease. We identify the myeloid tumor suppressor genes Egr1 and JunB and the DNA damage checkpoint kinase, polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) as deregulated genes whose disrupted signaling probably contributes to MDS/MPN.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, the duration of IFN-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation was found to exhibit significant interpatient variability and was prolonged in cells with high risk features, such as 11q- and 17p-deletions involving ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p53. This aberrant signaling pattern was associated with a paradoxical increase in cell size and number in response to IFN and similar alterations in IFN-signaling and responses were seen in cell lines that developed in the absence of p53 or ATM. However, direct inhibition of p53 or ATM failed to cause these changes, and CLL cells with aggressive clinical features were found to also express high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decrease tyrosine phosphatase activity. Prolonged IFN-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and lowered phosphatase activity could be reversed by antioxidants. These findings suggest that increased ROS levels may corrupt IFN-signaling processes in aggressive CLL cells, causing IFN to be used as a growth factor rather than a tumor suppressor.

Blocking the functions of the Rb protein family or adding back E2Fs to PML-expressing cells can rescue their defects in E2F-dependent gene expression and cell proliferation, inhibiting the senescent phenotype. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, a neoplastic disease that displays features of senescence, PML was found to be up-regulated and forming nuclear bodies.

We previously reported that U937 cells stimulated by H2 receptor agonists, despite a robust increase in cAMP, fail to mature because of rapid H2 receptor desensitization and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activation. Here we show that intracellular cAMP levels not only in U937 cells but also in other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines are also regulated by multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), particularly MRP4. U937, HL-60, and KG-1a cells, exposed to amthamine (H2-receptor agonist), augmented intracellular cAMP concentration with a concomitant increase in the efflux. Extrusion of cAMP was ATP-dependent and probenecid-sensitive, supporting that the transport was MRP-mediated. Cells exposed to amthamine and the PDE4 inhibitor showed enhanced cAMP extrusion, but this response was inhibited by MRP blockade. Amthamine stimulation, combined with PDE4 and MRP inhibition, induced maximal cell arrest proliferation. Knockdown strategy by shRNA revealed that this process was mediated by MRP4. Furthermore, blockade by probenecid or MRP4 knockdown showed that increased intracellular cAMP levels induce maturation in U937 cells. These findings confirm the key role of intracellular cAMP levels in leukemic cell maturation and provide the first evidence that MRP4 may represent a new potential target for leukemia differentiation therapy.",,"['Copsel, Sabrina', 'Garcia, Corina', 'Diez, Federico', 'Vermeulem, Monica', 'Baldi, Alberto', 'Bianciotti, Liliana G', 'Russel, Frans G M', 'Shayo, Carina', 'Davio, Carlos']","['Copsel S', 'Garcia C', 'Diez F', 'Vermeulem M', 'Baldi A', 'Bianciotti LG', 'Russel FG', 'Shayo C', 'Davio C']","['Laboratorio de Farmacologia de Receptores, Departamento de Farmacologia, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, 1113 Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['N02CO41101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CO-41101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110104,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '142437-67-0 (amthamine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rolipram/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3044954,2011/01/06 06:00,2011/05/05 06:00,['2011/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51892-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.166868 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Mar 4;286(9):6979-88. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.166868.

Key questions were selected according the criterion of clinical relevance. Statements were produced using a Delphi process, and two consensus conferences involving a panel of 21 experts appointed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) were convened. Patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) should be defined as high risk if age is greater than 60 years or there is a history of previous thrombosis. Risk stratification in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) should start with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for newly diagnosed patients and dynamic IPSS for patients being seen during their disease course, with the addition of cytogenetics evaluation and transfusion status. High-risk patients with PV should be managed with phlebotomy, low-dose aspirin, and cytoreduction, with either hydroxyurea or interferon at any age. High-risk patients with ET should be managed with cytoreduction, using hydroxyurea at any age. Monitoring response in PV and ET should use the ELN clinicohematologic criteria. Corticosteroids, androgens, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and immunomodulators are recommended to treat anemia of PMF, whereas hydroxyurea is the first-line treatment of PMF-associated splenomegaly. Indications for splenectomy include symptomatic portal hypertension, drug-refractory painful splenomegaly, and frequent RBC transfusions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: MLL5 transcript levels from 509 patients with AML who were treated in multicenter trials AML SHG 0199 and AML SHG 0295 and 48 healthy volunteers were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in the context of other molecular markers (NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, IDH1/IDH2, NRAS, KIT, MN1, BAALC, ERG, and WT1). RESULTS: Patients with high (n = 127) compared with low (n = 382) MLL5 expression had a higher complete response rate in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.24; P = .026). In multivariate analysis, high MLL5 expression was a favorable prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89; P = .007) and relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.01; P = .057). Patient characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, and gene mutations were similarly distributed between patients with high and low MLL5 expression except for a higher platelet count in those with high MLL5 expression. MLL5 expression independently predicted prognosis in cytogenetically normal AML patients (n = 268; OS: HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33 to 086; P = .011; RFS: HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99; P = .05) and in patients with core-binding factor leukemias (n = 81; OS: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.91; P = .04; RFS: HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.77; P = .02). The prognostic importance of high MLL5 expression was independently validated in 167 patients treated in the AMLSG 07/04 trial (OS: HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.92; P = .023; RFS: HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.96; P = .033).

METHODS: One hundred and seven patients with CLL without any clinical signs of arthritis and five patients with RA and concomitant CLL were included in the investigation. Serum samples were tested for RF-isotypes IgM, IgG and IgA. ACPA were determined with an ELISA that detects anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (aCCP) antibodies. RESULTS: RF well beyond the cut-off levels were detected in 50% of the CLL patients without RA. The isotype distribution was 41% IgM-RF, 20% IgG-RF and 3% IgA-RF. None of the 107 CLL patients without arthritis had Accp antibodies. Within the whole cohort of CLL patients the specificity for the diagnosis of RA was 100% for aCCP antibodies and 59% for IgM-RF.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between exposure to pesticides and LHC in an agricultural region of Greece. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was employed in a hospital-based case control study to gather information on demographics, occupation, exposure to pesticides, agricultural practices, family and medical history and smoking. To control for confounders, backward conditional and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used. To assess the dose-response relationship between exposure and disease, the chi-square test for trend was used. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-four (354) histologically confirmed LHC cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 and 455 sex- and age-matched controls were included in the study. Pesticide exposure was associated with total LHC cases (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.04), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.51) and leukaemia (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.20). A dose-response pattern was observed for total LHC cases (P = 0.004), MDS (P = 0.024) and leukaemia (P = 0.002). Pesticide exposure was independently associated with total LHC cases (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 - 2.00) and leukaemia (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.02-4.12) after controlling for age, smoking and family history (cancers, LHC and immunological disorders). Smoking during application of pesticides was strongly associated with total LHC cases (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.81-5.98), MDS (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.18-12.11), leukaemia (OR 10.15, 95% CI 2.15-65.69) and lymphoma (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-8.00). This association was even stronger for total LHC cases (OR 18.18, 95% CI 2.38-381.17) when eating simultaneously with pesticide application. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphohaematopoietic cancers were associated with pesticide exposure after controlling for confounders. Smoking and eating during pesticide application were identified as modifying factors increasing the risk for LHC.

We demonstrate here that preleukemic, disease-free Spa-1(-/-) mice show reduced steady-state hematopoiesis and attenuated resistance to whole body gamma-ray irradiation, which are attributable to the sustained p53 response in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Preleukemic Spa-1(-/-) HPCs show c-Myc overexpression with increased p19Arf as well as enhanced gammaH2AX expression with activation of Atm/Chk pathway. We also show that deregulated Rap signaling in the absence of Spa-1 enhances post-transcriptional c-Myc stability and induces DNA damage in a p38MAPK-dependent manner, leading to p53 activation. Genetic studies indicate that the introduction of p53(+/-) and p53(-/-) mutations in Spa-1(-/-) mice results in the acceleration of typical MPD and rapid development of blastic leukemia, respectively. These results suggest that increased c-Myc expression and DNA damage in HPCs precede MPD development in Spa-1(-/-) mice, and the resulting p53 response functions as a barrier for the onset of MPD and blast crises progression.",['(c) 2011 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Tanaka, Hiroki', 'Tamura, Akitoshi', 'Sekai, Miho', 'Hamazaki, Yoko', 'Minato, Nagahiro']","['Tanaka H', 'Tamura A', 'Sekai M', 'Hamazaki Y', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110202,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sipa1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', '*DNA Damage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*physiology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2011/01/06 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01850.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Apr;102(4):784-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01850.x.

Persistence of HTLV-1 in host T cells, clonal expansion of the HTLV-1 carrying T cells, and emergence of malignantly transformed T cells are in accord with the multistep model of human cancer and roles for continuous interaction between host genes and environmental factors. This article reviews two lines of HTLV-1 investigation, one regarding worldwide surveillance of HTLV-1 infection foci by serological testing and molecular analysis of HTLV-1 isolates, and the other focusing on genetics of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that determines the ethnic background of HTLV-1 permissiveness and susceptibility to ATL or HAM/TSP. The serological surveillance revealed transcontinental dispersal of HTLV-1 in the prehistoric era that started out of Africa, spread to Austro-Melanesia and the Asian continent, then moved to North America and through to the southern edge of South America. This was highlighted by an Andean mummy study that proved ancient migration of paleo-mongoloid HTLV-1 from Asia to South America. Phylogenetic analysis of HLA alleles provided a basis for ethnic susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection and associated diseases, both ATL and HAM/TSP.

It is not known whether such an effect occurs in vivo. In this study the relationships between white blood cell (WBC) count, plasma and cellular concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia were investigated. METHODS: Plasma and mononuclear blood cells were isolated from peripheral blood from 40 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia at end of infusion (time 1 h), 5 and 24 h following the first DNR infusion. DNR concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and related to the WBC count at diagnosis. A population pharmacokinetic model was used to estimate the correlations between baseline WBC count, volume of distribution and clearance of DNR. RESULTS: A clear but weak inverse relationship between the baseline WBC count and plasma concentrations of DNR (r(2)=0.11, P<0.05) at time 1 was found. Furthermore, a clear relationship between baseline WBC count and DNR central volume of distribution using population pharmacokinetic modelling (dOFV 4.77, P<0.05) was also noted. Analysis of plasma DNR and the metabolite daunorubicinol (DOL) concentrations in patients with a high WBC count support that the low DNR/DOL concentrations are due a distribution effect. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the leukaemic cell burden influences the plasma concentrations of anthracyclines. Further studies are needed to explore if patients with high a WBC count may require higher doses of anthracyclines.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to determine whether deficiencies in sulfonamide detoxification pathways, to include glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AA), and cytochrome b(5) (b5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase (b5R), were prevalent in these patients. A secondary pilot objective was to determine whether the incidence of drug hypersensitivity following intermittent trimethoprim-SMX (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis approached that reported for high dose daily regimens. METHODS: Forty adult patients with haematologic malignancies (HM) and 35 healthy adults were studied; an additional 13 HM patients taking ascorbate supplements (HM-AA) were also evaluated. Twenty-two of 40 HM patients were prescribed and were compliant with TMP-SMX 960 mg three to four times weekly. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between HM and healthy groups in plasma AA (median 37.2 microm vs. 33.9 microm) or red blood cell GSH (1.9 mmvs. 1.8 mm). However, plasma AA was correlated significantly with leucocyte b5/b5R reduction (r= 0.39, P= 0.002). Deficient b5/b5R activities were not found in HM patients. In fact, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or myeloma had significantly higher median activities (80.7 micromol mg(-1) min(-1)) than controls (18.9 micromol mg(-1) min(-1), P= 0.008). After 3-4 weeks of treatment, no patients developed SMX-specific T cells and only one patient developed rash. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiencies of blood antioxidants and b5/b5R reduction were not found in this population with haematologic malignancies, and the development of skin rash and drug-specific T cells appeared to be uncommon with intermittent TMP-SMX prophylaxis.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Acute leukemias are a diverse group of malignancies with a range of clinical presentations, prognoses, and preferred treatment protocols. Historical classification systems relied predominantly on morphologic and cytochemical features, but currently, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular data are incorporated to define clinically relevant diagnostic categories. Multiparameter flow cytometry provides rapid and detailed determination of antigen expression profiles in acute leukemias which, in conjunction with morphologic assessment, often suggests a definitive diagnosis or a narrow differential. Many recurrent molecular or cytogenetic aberrations are associated with distinct immunophenotypic features, and therefore flow cytometry is an important tool to direct further testing. In addition, detection of specific antigens may have prognostic or therapeutic implications even within a single acute leukemia subtype. After initial diagnosis, a leukemia's immunophenotypic fingerprint provides a useful reference to monitor response to therapy, minimal residual disease, and recurrence. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the application of flow cytometric immunophenotyping to the diagnosis and management of acute leukemias, including salient features of those entities described in the 2008 World Health Organization classification.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypoxic conditions of the 10 mum thick endosteal/osteoblastic niche where preleukemic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reside provides a radioprotective microenvironment that is 2- to 3-fold less radiosensitive than vascular niches. This supports partitioning the whole marrow target between the low haematological cancer risk of irradiating HSC in the endosteum and the vascular niches within central marrow. There is a greater risk of induced bone cancer when irradiating a 50 mum thick peripheral marrow adjacent to the remodelling/reforming portion of the trabecular bone surface, rather than marrow next to the quiescent bone surface. This choice of partitioned bone cancer target is substantiated by the greater radiosensitivity of: (i) Bone with high remodelling rates, (ii) the young, (iii) individuals with hypermetabolic benign diseases of bone, and (iv) the epidemiology of alpha-emitting exposures. Evidence is given to show that the absence of excess bone-cancer in atomic-bomb survivors may be partially related to the extremely low prevalence among Japanese of Paget's disease of bone. Radiation-induced fibrosis and the wound healing response may be implicated in not only radiogenic bone cancers but also leukaemia. A novel biological mechanism for adaptive response, and possibility of dynamic targets, is advocated whereby stem cells migrate from vascular niches to stress-mitigated, hypoxic niches.",,"['Richardson, Richard B']",['Richardson RB'],"['Radiological Protection Research and Instrumentation Branch, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Chalk River Laboratories, Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. richardr@aecl.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110104,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Bone Neoplasms/etiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Stem Cells/*radiation effects']",PMC3072695,2011/01/06 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2011/01/06 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2010.537430 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2011 Apr;87(4):343-59. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2010.537430.

Based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, CML is classified into three clinical phases, often starting with a chronic phase, progressing to an accelerated phase and ultimately ending in a terminal phase called blast crisis. Blast crisis phase of CML is clinically similar to an acute leukemia; in particular, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a severe form of acute leukemia in blast crisis, and there is no effective therapy for it yet. CML is induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene, whose gene product is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Currently, inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by its kinase inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a major therapeutic strategy for CML. However, the inability of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors to completely kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) indicates that these kinase inhibitors are unlikely to cure CML. In addition, drug resistance due to the development of BCRABL mutations occurs before and during treatment of CML with kinase inhibitors. A critical issue to resolve this problem is to fully understand the biology of LSCs, and to identify key genes that play significant roles in survival and self-renewal of LSCs. In this review, we will focus on LSCs in CML by summarizing and discussing available experimental results, including the original studies from our own laboratory.",,"['Chen, Yaoyu', 'Peng, Cong', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Chen Y', 'Peng C', 'Li D', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100206,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",PMC4875160,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13238-010-0016-z [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Cell. 2010 Feb;1(2):124-32. doi: 10.1007/s13238-010-0016-z.

ZAP directly binds to the target viral mRNA and recruits the cellular RNA degradation machinery to degrade the RNA. No significant sequence similarity or obvious common motifs have been found in the so far identified target viral mRNAs. The minimum length of the target sequence is about 500 nt long. Short workable ZAP-binding RNAs should facilitate further studies on the ZAP-RNA interaction and characterization of such RNAs may provide some insights into the underlying mechanism. In this study, we used the SELEX method to isolate ZAP-binding RNA aptamers. After 21 rounds of selection, ZAP-binding aptamers were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that they are G-rich RNAs with predicted stem-loop structures containing conserved ""GGGUGG"" and ""GAGGG"" motifs in the loop region. Insertion of the aptamer sequence into a luciferase reporter failed to render the reporter sensitive to ZAP. However, overexpression of the aptamers modestly but significantly reduced ZAP's antiviral activity. Substitution of the conserved motifs of the aptamers significantly impaired their ZAP-binding ability and ZAP-antagonizing activity, suggesting that the RNA sequence is important for specific interaction between ZAP and the target RNA.

Telomere length was measured by an automated multi-colour flow-FISH, and an age-independent delta telomere length (DeltaTL) was calculated. CLL with unmutated IGHV genes was associated with shorter telomeres (p = 0.002). Furthermore, we observed a linear correlation between the frequency of IGHV gene mutations and elongation of telomeres (r = 0.509, p < 0.001). With respect to prognosis, a threshold DeltaTL of -4.2 kb was the best predictor for progression-free and overall survival. DeltaTL was not significantly altered over time or with therapy. The correlation between the mutational load in IGHV genes and the DeltaTL in CLL might reflect the initial telomere length of the putative cell of origin (pre- versus post-germinal center B cells).

We used linear amplification-mediated PCR and pyrosequencing to build a genome-wide, high-definition map of retroviral integration sites in the genome of peripheral blood T cells from two different donors and used gene expression profiling and bioinformatics to associate integration clusters to transcriptional activity and to genetic and epigenetic features of the T cell genome. Comparison with matched random controls and with integrations obtained from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells showed that integration clusters occur within chromatin regions bearing epigenetic marks associated with active promoters and regulatory elements in a cell-specific fashion. Analysis of integration sites in T cells obtained ex vivo two months after infusion showed no evidence of integration-related clonal expansion or dominance, but rather loss of cells harboring integration events interfering with RNA post-transcriptional processing. The study shows that high-definition maps of retroviral integration sites are a powerful tool to analyze the fate of genetically modified T cells in patients and the biological consequences of retroviral transduction.",,"['Cattoglio, Claudia', 'Maruggi, Giulietta', 'Bartholomae, Cynthia', 'Malani, Nirav', 'Pellin, Danilo', 'Cocchiarella, Fabienne', 'Magnani, Zulma', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Ambrosi, Alessandro', 'von Kalle, Christof', 'Bushman, Frederic D', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Schmidt, Manfred', 'Mavilio, Fulvio', 'Recchia, Alessandra']","['Cattoglio C', 'Maruggi G', 'Bartholomae C', 'Malani N', 'Pellin D', 'Cocchiarella F', 'Magnani Z', 'Ciceri F', 'Ambrosi A', 'von Kalle C', 'Bushman FD', 'Bonini C', 'Schmidt M', 'Mavilio F', 'Recchia A']","['IIT Unit of Molecular Neuroscience, Istituto Scientifico H.

However, several subsequent studies failed to detect the virus in patients suffering from these illnesses or in healthy subjects. Here we report the results of efforts to detect antibody responses and viral sequences in samples from a cohort of German CFS and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with fatigue symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Blood samples were taken from a cohort of 39 patients fulfilling the Fukuda/CDC criteria (CFS), from 112 patients with an established MS diagnosis and from 40 healthy donors. Fatigue severity in MS patients was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Validated Gag- and Env-ELISA assays were used to screen sera for XMRV antibodies. PHA-activated PBMC were cultured for seven days in the presence of IL-2 and DNA isolated from these cultures as well as from co-cultures of PBMC and highly permissive LNCaP cells was analyzed by nested PCR for the presence of the XMRV gag gene. In addition, PBMC cultures were exposed to 22Rv1-derived XMRV to assess infectivity and virus production. CONCLUSION: None of the screened sera from CFS and MS patients or healthy blood donors tested positive for XMRV specific antibodies and all PBMC (and PBMC plus LNCaP) cultures remained negative for XMRV sequences by nested PCR. These results argue against an association between XMRV infection and CFS and MS in Germany. However, we could confirm that PBMC cultures from healthy donors and from CFS patients can be experimentally infected by XMRV, resulting in the release of low levels of transmittable virus.",,"['Hohn, Oliver', 'Strohschein, Kristin', 'Brandt, Alexander U', 'Seeher, Sandra', 'Klein, Sandra', 'Kurth, Reinhard', 'Paul, Friedemann', 'Meisel, Christian', 'Scheibenbogen, Carmen', 'Bannert, Norbert']","['Hohn O', 'Strohschein K', 'Brandt AU', 'Seeher S', 'Klein S', 'Kurth R', 'Paul F', 'Meisel C', 'Scheibenbogen C', 'Bannert N']","['Centre for Biological Security 4, Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101222,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*blood/*virology', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*blood/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics']",PMC3008728,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015632 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Dec 22;5(12):e15632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015632.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is well known that CML cells are genetically unstable, the mechanisms accounting for this genomic instability are still poorly understood. Because the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is believed to control several mechanisms of DNA repair, we investigated whether this pathway was disrupted in CML cells. Our data show that CML cells have a defective capacity to generate FANCD2 nuclear foci, either in dividing cells or after DNA damage. Similarly, human cord blood CD34(+) cells transduced with BCR/ABL retroviral vectors showed impaired FANCD2 foci formation, whereas FANCD2 monoubiquitination in these cells was unaffected. Soon after the transduction of CD34(+) cells with BCR/ABL retroviral vectors a high proportion of cells with supernumerary centrosomes was observed. Similarly, BCR/ABL induced a high proportion of chromosomal abnormalities, while mediated a cell survival advantage after exposure to DNA cross-linking agents. Significantly, both the impaired formation of FANCD2 nuclear foci, and also the predisposition of BCR/ABL cells to develop centrosomal and chromosomal aberrations were reverted by the ectopic expression of BRCA1. Taken together, our data show for the first time a disruption of the FA/BRCA pathway in BCR/ABL cells, suggesting that this defective pathway should play an important role in the genomic instability of CML by the co-occurrence of centrosomal amplification and DNA repair deficiencies.",,"['Valeri, Antonio', 'Alonso-Ferrero, Maria Eugenia', 'Rio, Paula', 'Pujol, Maria Roser', 'Casado, Jose A', 'Perez, Laura', 'Jacome, Ariana', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Hanenberg, Helmut', 'Surralles, Jordi', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Albella, Beatriz', 'Bueren, Juan A']","['Valeri A', 'Alonso-Ferrero ME', 'Rio P', 'Pujol MR', 'Casado JA', 'Perez L', 'Jacome A', 'Agirre X', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Hanenberg H', 'Surralles J', 'Prosper F', 'Albella B', 'Bueren JA']","['Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales y Tecnologicas and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['R01 CA155294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101228,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (FANCD2 protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Centrosome/ultrastructure', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Fanconi Anemia/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Genes, BRCA1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",PMC3011007,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015525 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Dec 28;5(12):e15525. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015525.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: A 35-year-old Caucasian man with a history of refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia was admitted for a third allogeneic, mismatched, peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor, with a conditioning regimen that included busulfan and fludarabine. The patient was receiving treatment with lidocaine patch 5% (two patches daily, which was started five months before another hospital admission for the treatment of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy. Baseline laboratory findings were within normal limits except for disease-related neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Twenty days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the patient developed signs and symptoms of severe hepatic SOS. His serum alanine transaminase concentration rose from 65 IU/L at baseline to 370 IU/L, and his serum aspartate transaminase concentration rose from 32 IU/L at baseline to 871 IU/L. His total bilirubin increased to 2.8 mg/dL, and his body weight increased by 15%. An abdominal ultrasound noted ascites and hepatomegaly without reversal of blood flow. The lidocaine patch was discontinued, but the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. He died 38 days after HSCT from complications of severe hepatic SOS. CONCLUSION: A 35-year-old man developed hepatic SOS 20 days after his third HSCT.

N-Ras(G12D) expression led to Bcl-2 up-regulation and reduced apoptosis. Ectopic Bcl-2 expression also resulted in enhanced colony-forming and replating abilities but was insufficient to sustain cytokine independence.

Human blinkin/human Spc105 (hSpc105)/hKNL1 was identified originally as a mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion partner and later as a kinetochore component. Blinkin directly binds to several structural and regulatory proteins, but the precise binding sites have not been defined. Here, we report distinct and essential binding domains for Bub1 and BubR1 (here designated Bubs) at the N terminus of blinkin and for Zwint-1 and hMis14/hNsl1 at the C terminus. The minimal binding sites for Bub1 and BubR1 are separate but contain a consensus KI motif, KI(D/N)XXXF(L/I)XXLK. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated replacement with mutant blinkin reveals that the Bubs-binding domain is functionally important for chromosome alignment and segregation. We also provide evidence that hMis14 mediates hNdc80 binding to blinkin at the kinetochore. The C-terminal fragment of blinkin locates at kinetochores in a dominant-negative fashion by displacing endogenous blinkin from kinetochores. This negative dominance is relieved by mutations of the hMis14 binding PPSS motif on the C terminus of blinkin or by fusion of the N sequence that binds to Bub1 and BubR1. Taken together, these results indicate that blinkin functions to connect Bub1 and BubR1 with the hMis12, Ndc80, and Zwint-1 complexes, and disruption of this connection may lead to tumorigenesis.",,"['Kiyomitsu, Tomomi', 'Murakami, Hiroaki', 'Yanagida, Mitsuhiro']","['Kiyomitsu T', 'Murakami H', 'Yanagida M']","['Department of Gene Mechanisms, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Honmachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. tomomi.kiyomitsu@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110103,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Knl1 protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (NDC80 protein, human)', '0 (NSL1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (ZWINT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bub1 spindle checkpoint protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Kinetochores/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/*metabolism']",PMC3067818,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/04/08 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00815-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00815-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2011 Mar;31(5):998-1011. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00815-10.

Mutations in Bax that promote apoptosis can provide insight into how Bax is regulated. Here, we describe crystal structures of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in complex with a 34-mer peptide from Bax that encompasses its BH3 domain. These structures reveal canonical interactions between four signature hydrophobic amino acids from the BaxBH3 domain and the BH3-binding groove of the pro-survival proteins. In both structures, Met-74 from the Bax peptide engages with the BH3-binding groove in a fifth hydrophobic interaction. Various Bax Met-74 mutants disrupt interactions between Bax and all pro-survival proteins, but these Bax mutants retain pro-apoptotic activity. Bax/Bak-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells reconstituted with several Bax Met-74 mutants are more sensitive to the BH3 mimetic compound ABT-737 as compared with cells expressing wild-type Bax. Furthermore, the cells expressing Bax Met-74 mutants are less viable in colony assays even in the absence of an external apoptotic stimulus.

Sources of electric and magnetic field exposures may be occupational or residential and include proximity to certain types of electrical equipment, transmission and distribution power lines as well as appliance use. The early studies of children tended toward a consistent association between risks for leukemia and brain cancer and residential proximity to power lines having high wire configuration. More recent studies-and studies which have attempted to improve upon the measurement of exposure by using calculated fields, point-in-time or personal monitoring-have been inconsistent, with some suggesting increased risk and others not. Occupational exposures have suggested an increase in risk for leukemia, and to a lesser extent brain cancer and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, studies of residential exposures and cancer in adults generally have suggested no effect. Laboratory work has been unable to demonstrate a biological mechanism which might explain the epidemiological findings. In spite of extensive efforts over the past 20 years and many expert reviews, it has been difficult to reach consensus regarding the carcinogenic effects of electric and magnetic fields. Exposure assessment has proven to be complex, and agreement on the relevant exposure metric has not yet been obtained. There is justification to question whether point-in-time measures in homes are appropriate indices of the relevant etiological exposure, as they fail to account for changes over time, peak exposures or time-varying fields. Nevertheless, it is probably desirable to err on the side of caution in not placing too much weight on the inconsistencies. The IARC has classified EMF as a ""possible carcinogen"" which refers to the circumstances where there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and inadequate evidence in experimental animals. The IARC review indicated limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields in relation to childhood leukemia at high level exposure in the residential environment (average residential magnetic field strength >0.4 muT).

Although the disease is biologically heterogeneous, dysregulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis both occur frequently and contribute to the malignant phenotype. Chronic liver disease is associated with intrahepatic inflammation which promotes dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways; this triggers proliferation and thus lays the ground for expansion of premalignant cells. Cancer emerges when immunological control fails and transformed cells develop resistance against cell death signaling pathways. The same mechanisms underlie the poor responsiveness of HCC towards chemotherapy. Only recently advances in understanding the signaling pathways involved has led to the development of an effective pharmacological therapy for advanced disease. The current review will discuss apoptosis signaling pathways and focus on apoptosis resistance of HCC involving derangements in cell death receptors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF], CD95/Apo-1, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL]) and associated adapter molecules (e.g. FADD and FLIP) of apoptotic signaling pathways. In addition, the role of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) and members of the B cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family that contribute to the regulation of apoptosis in hepatocytes are discussed. Eventually, the delineation of cell death signaling pathways could contribute to the implementation of new therapeutic strategies to treat HCC.","['(c) 2011 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell', 'Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.']","['Schattenberg, Jorn Markus', 'Schuchmann, Marcus', 'Galle, Peter Robert']","['Schattenberg JM', 'Schuchmann M', 'Galle PR']","['Department of Medicine, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany. schatten@uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,2011/01/14 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06582.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2011 Jan;26 Suppl 1:213-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06582.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate patients with DADS neuropathy without anti-MAG antibodies, and study their response to immunotherapy. METHODS: Patients were selected on the basis of (i) 'Definite CIDP' according to the EFNS/PNS Guideline criteria, (ii) The presence of disproportionately prolonged motor latencies resulting in a terminal latency index (TLI) </= 0.25 in at least two motor nerves and (iii) The absence of anti-MAG antibodies on ELISA. Response to immunotherapy was defined as persistent improvement by at least one point on the INCAT disability score. RESULTS: Data from 146 CIDP patients were analysed, and 10 patients were included. Six had clinically pure sensory neuropathy, and four had sensorimotor neuropathy. Ataxia was present in nine patients, generalized areflexia in seven and postural tremor in two. Five of the 10 patients had abnormal sensory potentials only in the upper limbs. An associated condition was found in nine patients: two chronic lymphocytic leukaemias, four IgG monoclonal gammopathies (one associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and two IgM monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance. Patients were mostly improved with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticosteroids, plasma exchanges, or a combination thereof. CONCLUSION: DADS neuropathy without anti-MAG antibodies is more likely to be considered a variant of CIDP.

To evaluate whether this drug can increase the activity of cytotoxic drugs on BCR/ABL positive cells, we measured the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), hydroxyurea (HU) and melphalan (MEL), after a pretreatment of 24 h with IM on K562 cell line. The highest cytotoxic effect was seen when the TKI was followed by MEL; our results indicate that inhibition of BCR/ABL activity by IM increased the cytotoxicity of MEL by favoring the DNA damage induced by this drug and by shortening the time for DNA repair at the G2/M checkpoint. A stronger activation of some genes involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways was also observed with IM/MEL combination compared to IM or MEL alone. The drugs association was further tested in a type of BaF3 cells (TonB.210) where the BCR-ABL expression is inducible by doxycycline; in this model it was confirmed that a reduction of BCR/ABL activity resulted in an increased susceptibility to the cytotoxic effect of MEL. Furthermore, we studied the effect of IM/MEL treatment on the proliferative potential of myeloid progenitors of six CML patients at diagnosis. The analysis of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies demonstrated that the IM/MEL combination was more effective than IM alone in reducing the overall number of colonies and the number of copies of BCR/ABL. In conclusion, our work shows that inhibition of BCR/ABL activity increases the toxicity of MEL and allows an efficient killing of leukemic cells, suggesting that a clinical development of this approach could have therapeutic advantages for CML patients.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Giallongo, Cesarina', 'La Cava, Piera', 'Tibullo, Daniele', 'Parrinello, Nunziatina', 'Barbagallo, Ignazio', 'Del Fabro, Vittorio', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Conticello, Concetta', 'Romano, Alessandra', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe A', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Giallongo C', 'La Cava P', 'Tibullo D', 'Parrinello N', 'Barbagallo I', 'Del Fabro V', 'Stagno F', 'Conticello C', 'Romano A', 'Chiarenza A', 'Palumbo GA', 'Di Raimondo F']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ospedale Ferrarotto, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110208,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, abl/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2011/01/05 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01570.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Mar;86(3):216-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01570.x.

The PML gene has been discovered 20 years ago and has led to new insights into oncogenesis, apoptosis, cell senescence, and antiviral defense. PML is induced by IFN, leading to a marked increase of expression of PML isoforms and the number of PML nuclear bodies (NBs). PML is the organizer of the NBs that contains at least 2 permanent NB-associated proteins, the IFN-stimulated gene product Speckled protein of 100 kDa (Sp100) and death-associated dead protein (Daxx), as well as numerous other transient proteins recruited in these structures in response to different stimuli.

Until then, despite the international alarm, the level of awareness was low and very few Italian hospitals were equipped with ECMOs. Moreover the PCR test for A H1N1 virus was sporadically available and the emergency departments of even the largest institutions could rely only on the rapid test for the urgent screening of patients with pneumonia and respiratory failure. On September 5th, a young and ""apparently"" previously healthy man, was admitted to our ICU because of a severe ARDS caused by influenza A H1N1 virus. As there was no ECMO available, he was treated with prolonged cycles of prone positioning ventilation. Antiviral treatment was started with Oseltamivir, but as enteral absorption was impaired by paralytic ileus and tube feeding intolerance, Oseltamivir had to be discontinued. Intravenous Zanamivir 1200 mg/day for ten days was therefore prescribed as ""off label"" antiviral therapy. A bone marrow biopsy allowed the diagnosis of an initial stage of ""hairy cells leukaemia."" ARDS related to A/H1N1 influenza was the first sign of the disease in our patient. He did well with complete clearance of the infection from the BAL after 10 days of Zanamivir, although the nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for ten more days. Prone positioning ventilation may be a life-saver strategy in patients with severe ARDS when ECMO is not immediately available. However, prone positioning ventilation is often associated with severe impairment of the absorption of drugs that require enteral administration via the nasogastric tube. In these cases, intravenous Zanamivir may be an effective alternative strategy.",,"['Gristina, Giuseppe', 'Nardi, Giuseppe', 'Orazi, Daniela', 'Lauria, Francesco Nicola', 'Valli, Maria Beatrice', 'Lalle, Eleonora', 'Menzo, Stefano', 'Riccioni, Luigi', 'Camporiondo, Maria Pia']","['Gristina G', 'Nardi G', 'Orazi D', 'Lauria FN', 'Valli MB', 'Lalle E', 'Menzo S', 'Riccioni L', 'Camporiondo MP']","['Intensive Care Unit 1 Shock and Trauma Department, Azienda Ospedaliera San Camillo-Forlanini, Viale Gianicolense 87, 00152 Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20101215,Egypt,Crit Care Res Pract,Critical care research and practice,101539357,,,,PMC3010614,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/01/05 06:01,['2011/01/04 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2010/146456 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Res Pract. 2010;2010:146456. doi: 10.1155/2010/146456.

METHODS: We analyzed data on tolerability, measured as compliance with the treatment, and patients' acceptance of an alternative MTX treatment schedule in 12 patients with aggressive RRMS or SPMS treated for at least 3 years with low/delayed dose MTX. RESULTS: Twelve patients received 9-17 cycles of MTX treatment, with individual median doses of 7.6-12.16 mg/m(2)/course during 36 to 114 (median 49.5) months resulting in cumulative doses of 101.9-143.0 mg/m(2) per patient. The overall follow-up period was 37-122 (median 69.5) months. Treatment was well tolerated and appreciated by patients according to the Treatment Satisfaction-Visual Analogue Scale. No significant safety findings were seen concerning cardiological, hematological and oncological follow-up. The patients showed a stabilization of disease progression and a reduced annual relapse rate. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed, and/or dose-reduced, long-term MTX regimens over several years might represent a feasible alternative treatment for MS patients without any other therapeutic options.","['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

This study was conducted to characterize the activity and antigen levels of ADAMTS-13 and von Willebrand factor (vWF) in patients with different thrombocytopenic disorders in Kuwait. METHODS: Forty healthy subjects and 41 patients with different thrombocytopenic disorders were recruited for this study. ELISA tests were used to measure ADAMTS-13 and vWF activity and antigen levels in patients and controls. RESULTS: All TTP patients had severely deficient ADAMTS-13 activity (<5%), which was significantly lower than that of controls (p < 0.001). Severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13 was also found in some, but not all, patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, acute leukemia and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report ADAMTS-13 levels in this part of the world. ADAMTS-13 was found to be severely deficient in TTP patients. We present evidence that significantly lower levels of ADAMTS-13 were not specific for TTP and can be found in other thrombocytopenic disorders. We also hypothesize that clinical manifestation of TTP may not be solely due to ADAMTS-13 deficiency, and there might be other contributing factors, since the deficiency was also found in some healthy controls.","['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

We review the scientific evidence validating this model, emphasize the importance of the fitness landscape in the stem cell pool, outline the clinical and investigative implications of the model, suggest that the lack of fitness in the starting pool accounts for the phenomenon of oncogene addiction, promote the value of the model for the evaluation of prevention strategies, and argue that experiments focusing attention on the relative phenotypes of neoplastic stem cell clones and pools of unfit stem cells from which they evolved will provide a useful paradigm of carcinogenesis in general.",,"['Bagby, Grover C', 'Fleischman, Angela G']","['Bagby GC', 'Fleischman AG']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA. grover@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['5T32HL007781/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL048546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20110101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Schol Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Scholar edition),101485241,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Bone Marrow failure syndromes']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic', 'Bone Marrow Diseases', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Genetic Fitness/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Selection, Genetic']",,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/05/18 06:00,['2011/01/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['167 [pii]', '10.2741/s167 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Schol Ed). 2011 Jan 1;3:487-500. doi: 10.2741/s167.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying the patients at risk is mandatory in this clinical setting and prophylaxis with antiviral drugs or close monitoring may reduce and/or eliminate the HBV reactivation risk and the serious consequences. In general, preemptive anti-HBV therapy is more effective than treatment at reactivation. Prompt lamivudine prophylaxis should be given to HBsAg positive patients (inactive carriers) undergoing chemotherapy-immunochemotherapy and continued after cessation of immunosuppression even though long-term lamivudine therapy involves a risk of developing drug resistance.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is feasible and has low treatment-related mortality in follicular lymphoma, but there are questions relating to optimal timing of the procedure, conditioning regimen, and late effects. Myeloablative allogeneic HSCT is associated with high treatment-related morbidity and mortality, few late relapses, but is applicable to only a small number of patients. The major focus of HSCT in these lymphomas has been with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HSCT, which is applicable to the age distribution of these diseases and which exploits the graft-versus-lymphoma effect in these diseases. Steps to further decrease the morbidity and mortality of the RIC HSCT and in particular to reduce the incidence of chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while maintaining tumor control remain the major focus.

Identification of single genes important in disease, and the development of a mechanistic understanding of genetic elements that regulate gene function, have cast light on the pathophysiology of many heritable and acquired disorders. In 1990, the human genome project commenced, with the goal of sequencing the entire human genome, and a ""first draft"" was published with astonishing speed in 2001. The first draft, although an extraordinary achievement, reported essentially an imaginary haploid mix of alleles rather than a true diploid genome. In the years since 2001, technology has further improved, and efforts have been focused on filling in the gaps in the initial genome and starting the huge task of looking at normal variation in the human genome. This work is the beginning of understanding human genetics in the context of the structure of the genome as a complete entity, and as more than simply the sum of a series of genes. We present 3 studies in this review that apply genomic approaches to leukemia and to transplantation to improve and extend therapies.","['Copyright A(c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Whether patients defined as high risk by new methods will benefit from HSCT requires careful testing. Standardization and improvement of transplant approaches has led to equivalent survival outcomes with matched sibling and well-matched unrelated donors; however, survival using mismatched and haploidentical donors is generally worse.

This makes it difficult to perform clinic trials that can define the best therapeutic option when considering the impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) versus the established approach of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With the relatively low toxicity of TKIs, there are little data regarding when HCT or long-term TKI therapy is a better option. There are even less data regarding the duration of TKI treatment in the pediatric CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) patients who may receive over 60 years of therapy. As children and adolescent are treated for longer times with TKIs, it has become clear that toxicities may make long-term TKI therapy less attractive compared to allogeneic HCT. HCT has the long-term complications of growth failure, infertility, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), metabolic syndrome, and secondary malignancies, whereas prolonged TKIs may cause growth failure, hepatic, and cardiac complications. Moreover, HCT is a potentially curative intervention, whereas TKI is not curative, requiring prolonged exposure. In this article, we discuss the relative merit of the 2 therapeutic approaches and recommend that all children and adolescents with CML-CP should initially be treated with imatinib and maintained with TKI therapy indefinitely if there is a good response. We recommend that allogeneic HCT with an HLA-identical sibling donor or closely matched unrelated donor be considered for patients with treatment failure or recurrence after receiving salvage second-generation TKI treatment. We also conclude that randomized international trials are urgently needed to evaluate the best therapies for pediatric CML.","['Copyright A(c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Coexposure of K562 or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells from patients to subtoxic concentrations of SKI (10 muM) and bortezomib (100 nM) resulted in a synergistic increase in caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis. These events were associated with the downregulation of BCR-ABL and Mcl-1, and a marked reduction in SPK1 expression. In imatinib mesylate-resistant K562 cells that displayed decreased BCR-ABL expression, bortezomib/SKI treatment markedly increased apoptosis and inhibited colony-formation in association with the downregulation of Mcl-1. Finally, the bortezomib/SKI regimen also potently induced the downregulation of BCR/ABL and Mcl-1 in human leukemia cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that combining SKI and bortezomib may represent a novel strategy in leukemia, including apoptosis-resistant BCR-ABL(+) hematologic malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It might be expected that patients relapsing after inferior initial therapy would have a higher retrieval rate than after superior therapy. In the Children's Oncology Group Study CCG-1961, significantly superior EFS and survival were achieved with an augmented (stronger) versus standard intensity regimen of postinduction intensification (PII) for children with newly diagnosed high-risk ALL and rapid day 7 marrow response (EFS/survival 81.2%/88.7% vs 71.7%/83.4%, respectively). This provided an opportunity to evaluate postrelapse survival (PRS) in 272 relapsed patients who had received randomly allocated initial treatment with augmented or standard intensity PII. As expected, PRS was worse for early versus late relapse, marrow versus extramedullary site, adolescent versus younger age and T versus B lineage. However, no difference in 3-year PRS was detected for having received augmented versus standard intensity PII (36.4% +/- 5.7% vs 39.2% +/- 4.1%; log rank P = .72). Similar findings were noted within subanalyses by timing and site of relapse, age, and immunophenotype. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of relapse in ALL, and are consistent with emergence of a resistant subclone that has acquired spontaneous mutations largely independent of initial therapy.

Therefore, developing inhibitors of this protein based on a thorough understanding of its mechanism of action is an active and promising area of inquiry. One approach centers on agents (eg, ABT-737) that compete with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family for binding in the hydrophobic groove formed by the BH1-BH3 domains of Bcl-2. Another region of Bcl-2, the BH4 domain, also contributes to the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 by binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) Ca(2)(+) channel, inhibiting IP(3)-dependent Ca(2)(+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum. We report that a novel synthetic peptide, modeled after the Bcl-2-interacting site on the IP(3)R, binds to the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 and functions as a competitive inhibitor of the Bcl-2-IP(3)R interaction. By disrupting the Bcl-2-IP(3)R interaction, this peptide induces an IP(3)R-dependent Ca(2)(+) elevation in lymphoma and leukemia cell lines and in primary CLL cells. The Ca(2)(+) elevation evoked by this peptide induces apoptosis in CLL cells, but not in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting the involvement of the Bcl-2-IP(3)R interaction in the molecular mechanism of CLL and indicating the potential merit of targeting this interaction therapeutically.",,"['Zhong, Fei', 'Harr, Michael W', 'Bultynck, Geert', 'Monaco, Giovanni', 'Parys, Jan B', 'De Smedt, Humbert', 'Rong, Yi-Ping', 'Molitoris, Jason K', 'Lam, Minh', 'Ryder, Christopher', 'Matsuyama, Shigemi', 'Distelhorst, Clark W']","['Zhong F', 'Harr MW', 'Bultynck G', 'Monaco G', 'Parys JB', 'De Smedt H', 'Rong YP', 'Molitoris JK', 'Lam M', 'Ryder C', 'Matsuyama S', 'Distelhorst CW']","['Department of Medicine and Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM08803-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA059366/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007147/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101230,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BIRD-2 peptide)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",PMC3062302,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)43184-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-307405 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 10;117(10):2924-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-307405.

We aimed to assess: (i) in how many patients BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are already detectable at relatively low levels at the time of diagnosis, and (ii) whether mutation detection correlates with subsequent response to therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed samples collected at diagnosis from 15 patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who subsequently received tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (dasatinib) by cloning the BCR-ABL kinase domain in a bacterial vector and sequencing 200 independent clones per sample. RESULTS: Mutations at relatively low levels (2-4 clones out of 200) could be detected in all patients--eight who relapsed and seven who achieved persistent remission. Each patient had evidence of two to eight different mutations, the majority of which have never been reported in association with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In two patients out of six who relapsed because of a mutation, the mutation (a T315I) was already detectable in a few clones at the time of diagnosis. On the other hand, a patient who was found to harbor an F317L mutation is in persistent remission on dasatinib.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow CD34(+) cells obtained from patients were injected, with or without human mesenchymal stem cells, into the bone marrow of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient/IL2Rgamma(null) hosts. Engraftment and differentiation of cells derived from the patients were investigated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Co-injection of patients' cells and human mesenchymal stem cells led to successful engraftment of patient-derived cells that maintained the immunophenotypes and genomic abnormalities of the original patients. Myelodysplastic syndrome-originated clones differentiated into mature neutrophils, megakaryocytes, and erythroblasts. Two of the samples derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes were able to sustain neoplastic growth into the next generation while these cells had limited differentiation ability in the murine host. The hematopoiesis of mice engrafted with patients' cells was significantly suppressed even when human cells accounted for less than 1% of total marrow mononuclear cells. Histological studies revealed invasion of the endosteal surface by patient-derived CD34(+) cells and disruption of extracellular matrix architecture, which probably caused inhibition of murine hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: We established murine models of human myelodysplastic syndromes using cells obtained from patients: the presence of neoplastic cells was associated with the suppression of normal host hematopoiesis.

Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are detected in 40-60% of patients. Multiple recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified by cytogenetics including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which is now widely recognized as one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic markers in MDS. METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics by GTG-banding, FISH, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was done on 40 primary MDS subjects. RESULTS: Among 40 subjects, 10 (25%) were abnormal and 30 (75%) showed apparently normal karyotypes with GTG banding and FISH. The various aberrations observed were del 5q-, del 7q-, 20q-, +8. DNA copy number changes including losses (30%) and gains (20%) were detected by CGH in 11 (36.6%) out of 30 karyotypically normal MDS. However chromosome 7 (37%) and 1 (25%) is frequently involved in current study population. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the apart from non-random chromosome aberrations, other chromosome regions also involved in the MDS development. The occupational, environmental and geographical variations might be influencing the disease. Furthermore cytogenetic studies are warranted in larger groups of MDS cases to identify newly acquired chromosome aberrations that may aid in cloning new genes involved in the neoplastic process, ultimately helping in the development of targeted therapeutic drugs.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess whether use of unrelated donors (URD) engenders more potent GVL in RIC HSCT compared to matched related donors (MRD), we retrospectively studied 433 consecutive T-replete 6/6 HLA matched URD (n = 246) and MRD (n = 187) RIC HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution. Diseases included: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (127), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (71), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (68), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (64), Hodgkin disease (HD) (40), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (25), multiple myeloma (MM) (23), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (12), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7), and other leukemia (1). All received uniform fludarabine and intravenous busulfan conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/mini-methroxate (mini-MTX) or tacrolimus/sirolimus +/- mini-MTX. Unrelated donors were younger compared to MRD (median donor age: 33 years versus 52 years, P < .0001), and provided larger CD34(+) products (median CD34(+) cells infused: 8.7 x 10(6)/kg versus 7.5 x 10(6)/kg, P = .002). Distribution of diseases, disease risk, prior transplant, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status was similar in both cohorts. Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (at day +180), 2-year chronic GVHD, and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 20% versus 16%, 55% versus 50%, and 8% versus 6% in URD and MRD, respectively (P = NS). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was lower in URD, 52% versus 65% (P = .005). With median follow-up of 26.5 and 35.8 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly better in unrelated donor transplants, 39.5% for URD, and 29% for MRD (P = .01). Overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 56% for URD versus 50% for MRD (P = .53). In multivariable analysis, URD was associated with a lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, P = .002) and superior PFS (HR 0.69, P = .002). These results suggest that URD is associated with greater GVL activity than MRD, and could have practice changing impact on future donor selection in RIC HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patients receiving treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have limited exposure to sunlight and often experience gastrointestinal side effects that may decrease their ability to maintain an adequate VD level. We hypothesized that patients with AML and ALL would have a low VD level after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), and that these patients would have a high incidence of osteoporosis/osteopenia. We therefore studied the incidence of low VD level and low bone mineral density after HCT. Of 289 patients with AML or ALL undergoing HCT between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2009, at the Cleveland Clinic, 58 (20.1%) patients had VD testing after HCT. Of these, 52 (89.7%) patients had a low VD level, and 6 (10.3%) had a normal level. Most patients with VD testing had graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and were taking corticosteroids (94.8% and 98.3%, respectively). Of the 49 patients with VD testing who also had bone mineral density testing, 65% had abnormal (low bone density) results. Only 21% of patients with VD testing were taking VD supplements prior to testing, and 65% had an elevated parathyroid hormone level. We found that most patients did not have VD testing after HCT, but those that did were very likely to have a low level and have low bone mineral density. Those with a low VD level were likely to have received corticosteroids, have GVHD, and have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Given the potential morbidity of low VD level, VD deficiency should be considered after HCT. Prospective study of VD level and its impact on morbidity and mortality after HCT is warranted.","['2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Published by Elsevier', 'Inc.

PML-nuclear body (NB) is required for HIPK2-mediated p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 and induction of apoptosis. Although PML-NB targeting of HIPK2 has been shown, much is not clear about the molecular mechanism of HIPK2 recruitment to PML-NBs. Here we show that HIPK2 colocalizes specifically with PML-I and PML-IV. Mutational analysis showed that HIPK2 recruitment to PML-IV-NBs is mediated by the SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) of both PML-IV and HIPK2. Wild-type HIPK2 associated with SUMO-conjugated PML-IV at a higher affinity than with un-conjugated PML-IV, while the association of a HIPK2 SIM mutant with SUMO-modified PML-IV was impaired. In colony formation assays, HIPK2 strongly suppressed cell proliferation, but HIPK2 SIM mutants did not. In addition, activation and phosphorylation of p53 at the Ser46 residue were impaired by HIPK2 SIM mutants. These results suggest that SIM-mediated HIPK2 targeting to PML-NBs is crucial for HIPK2-mediated p53 activation and induction of apoptosis.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Recent reports suggest that gossypol stimulates the generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in leukemia and colorectal carcinoma cells; however, gossypol-mediated cell death in leukemia cells was reported to be ROS-independent. This study was conducted to clarify the effect of ApoG2-induced ROS on mitochondria and cell viability, and to further evaluate its utility as a treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We tested the photocytotoxicity of ApoG2 to the poorly differentiated NPC cell line CNE-2 using the ROS-generating TL/10 illumination system. The rapid ApoG2-induced cell death was partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), but the ApoG2-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was not reversed by NAC. In the presence of TL/10 illumination, ApoG2 generated massive amounts of singlet oxygen and was more effective in inhibiting cell growth than in the absence of illumination. We also determined the influence of light on the anti-proliferative activity of ApoG2 using a CNE-2-xenograft mouse model. ApoG2 under TL/10 illumination healed tumor wounds and suppressed tumor growth more effectively than ApoG2 treatment alone. These results indicate that the ApoG2-induced CNE-2 cell death is partly ROS-dependent.

New alternatives in CLL therapy: managing adverse events.,suppl 1-15,,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell leukemia mainly affecting older adults. Historically, CLL has been regarded as an incurable disease, and treatment has been confined to cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. However, prognosis for patients treated with these agents remained poor, prompting the development of new, targeted agents. The introduction of rituximab, a CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody, revolutionized the treatment for this disease. Rituximab in combination with fludarabine improved response rates and length of progression-free survival. The success of rituximab in this setting has prompted the development of many more investigational agents for CLL, including other antibody agents. However, as with any medication, the potential benefit achieved with CLL therapies is mitigated by the safety risk for the patient. These agents have been associated with adverse events such as immunosuppression, reactivation of cytomegalovirus, and infusion-related reactions that can occur with antibody administration. Adverse events can greatly affect the patient's quality of life and ability to tolerate therapy. Management of adverse events is a critical component of the overall treatment strategy for CLL, particularly in elderly patients. In this clinical roundtable monograph, 3 expert physicians discuss the latest clinical studies evaluating the treatment of CLL, focusing on the adverse events associated with each agent and the potential interventions that can be used to manage their occurrence.",,"['Chanan-Khan, Asher', 'Kipps, Thomas', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Chanan-Khan A', 'Kipps T', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Division of Lymphoma/Myeloma, Roswell Park Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy']",,2011/01/05 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2011/01/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2010 Aug;8(8):suppl 1-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both conditions have the potential to present with similar clinical pictures. CASE: We report the history, evaluation, and treatment of a woman who had recently undergone stem cell transplant for acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with vaginal agglutination. A clinical diagnosis of erosive lichen planus versus chronic GVH disease was considered. CONCLUSIONS: Lichen planus and GVH disease are both inflammatory processes, which can present with a range of clinical conditions. Each may result in the development of irritative symptoms and erosive lesions on mucosal surfaces. Although lichen planus is a well-defined dermatosis, GVH disease is an iatrogenic process. We report the case history of a patient with erosive vulvovaginal lesions with scarring, likely caused by GVH disease, which mimicked erosive vulvovaginal lichen planus.

Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific, recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors. Therefore, the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation. Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nuclear p53 accumulation. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 70 patients (93%) with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), 9 of 13 patients (69%) with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), and 3 of 41 patients (7.3%) with osteosarcoma carried the mutation. The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was much higher than that reported elsewhere. Osteosarcoma in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome (P = .02). The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 187), recurrent ALL (n = 49), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 44), lymphoma (n = 30), non-CPC central nervous system tumors (n = 26), Ewing sarcoma (n = 25), or rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 8). Among the tumors that were available for analysis, LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs, in 2 of 2 CPCs, and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H. CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and, to a lesser extent, with osteosarcoma, both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",['2010 American Cancer Society.'],"['Seidinger, Ana Luiza', 'Mastellaro, Maria Jose', 'Paschoal Fortes, Fernanda', 'Godoy Assumpcao, Juliana', 'Aparecida Cardinalli, Izilda', 'Aparecida Ganazza, Monica', 'Correa Ribeiro, Raul', 'Brandalise, Silvia Regina', 'Dos Santos Aguiar, Simone', 'Yunes, Jose Andres']","['Seidinger AL', 'Mastellaro MJ', 'Paschoal Fortes F', 'Godoy Assumpcao J', 'Aparecida Cardinalli I', 'Aparecida Ganazza M', 'Correa Ribeiro R', 'Brandalise SR', 'Dos Santos Aguiar S', 'Yunes JA']","[""Molecular Biology Laboratory, Boldrini Children's Center, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101229,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/genetics', 'Brazil', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Choroid Plexus Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics', 'Prevalence']",,2010/12/31 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25826 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 May 15;117(10):2228-35. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25826.

However, although LIF overexpression during breast cancer progression was observed in our previous report, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this deregulation remain largely unknown. Here we show that LIF expression is epigenetically up-regulated via DNA demethylation and changes in histone methylation status within its promoter region in the isogenic MCF10 model. Bisulfite sequencing revealed the CpG pairs within the promoter region are hypermethylated in normal breast epithelial cells, but extensively demethylated as breast cancer progresses. In agreement with the DNA methylation pattern, our chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that inactive epigenetic marks such as MeCP2 occupancy and histone H3-Lys9-dimethylation significantly decreased during the progression to breast cancer but an active histone mark was increased in an inverse manner. Also, the occupancy of the transcription factor Sp1, which has higher affinity for hypomethylated CpGs, increased. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LIF expression resulted in a significant reduction of cell growth and colony formation in breast cancer cells, suggesting the potential role of LIF-LIF receptor axis in autocrine stimulation of cancer cells. Collectively, our data suggest that the epigenetic up-regulation of the LIF gene likely play an important role in the development of breast cancer.",,"['Shin, Jung Eun', 'Park, Su Hyung', 'Jang, Yeun Kyu']","['Shin JE', 'Park SH', 'Jang YK']","['Department of Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101203,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region/genetics"", 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA Interference/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics']",PMC3932684,2010/12/31 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10059-011-0020-z [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2011 Feb;31(2):181-9. doi: 10.1007/s10059-011-0020-z.

A non-radioactive HPLC-UV method was used for measuring the intracellular Ara-CTP, while a LC-MS/MS method was used to quantify intracellular dNTP/NTP pools. GTI-2040 was found to downregulate M2 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner and showed significant decrease in dNTP but not NTP pool. When combining GTI-2040 with Ara-C, a synergistic cytotoxicity was observed with no further change in dNTP/NTP pools. Importantly, pretreatment of K562 cells with GTI-2040 was found to increase Ara-CTP level for the first time, and this effect may be due to inhibition of RNR by GTI-2040.

In the current study, we investigated the anticancer properties of the novel rare-earth yttrium complex [YR(mtbmp)(thf)] in various established cell lines, and moreover, we identified the involved apoptotic pathway. Further aim was to investigate whether synergistic effects could be reached in combination with the conventional drug vincristine. We used the yttrium complex [YR(mtbmp)(thf)] in cells of leukemia (Nalm-6) and lymphoma (BJAB) and identified the main mechanism of the apoptosis induction by measuring the amount of hypodiploid DNA via FACS Scan analysis. Exposure of BJAB cells to [YR(mtbmp)(thf)] led to a death receptor-mediated reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis. The independence of Bcl-2 expression supports the suggestion that the [YR(mtbmp)(thf)]-induced apoptosis is mainly mediated via the extrinsic pathway.

Familial CLL does not appear to differ from sporadic CLL in terms of prognostic markers and clinical outcome. While some environmental factors (such as farming related exposures and occupational chemicals) may increase risk of CLL, results of epidemiological studies have been generally inconsistent inconsistent and well-defined extrinsic risk factors are unknown. Large, population-based case-control and cohort studies have also shown significant familial aggregation of CLL and related conditions including non-Hodgkin lymphomas, especially other indolent lymphomas. The precursor condition, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) also aggregates in CLL families. However because the baseline population risks for CLL and other indolent lymphomas are low, the absolute risk to a first-degree relative for developing CLL or a related disease is also low. Linkage studies have been conducted in high-risk CLL families to screen the whole genome for loci that contribute to susceptibility but no gene mutations have yet been identified by this method. Association studies of candidate genes have implicated several genes as being important in CLL but more studies are needed to verify these findings. Results from whole genome association are promising. The ability to conduct large scale genomic studies will play an important role in detecting susceptibility genes for CLL over the next few years and thereby help to delineate etiologic pathways.",,"['Goldin, Lynn R', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Marti, Gerald E', 'Caporaso, Neil E']","['Goldin LR', 'Landgren O', 'Marti GE', 'Caporaso NE']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Z01 CP004410-31/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],,England,European J Clin Med Oncol,European journal of clinical & medical oncology,101531943,,,,PMC3010372,2010/12/31 06:00,2010/12/31 06:01,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,European J Clin Med Oncol. 2010 Feb;2(1):119-126.,,['NIHMS180565'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These amino acid motifs facilitate viral egress by interacting with components of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery, ultimately leading to membrane scission by recruiting ESCRT-III to the site of viral budding. PPXY late (L) domains present in viruses such as murine leukemia virus (MLV) or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) access the ESCRT pathway via interaction with HECT ubiquitin ligases (WWP1, WWP2, and Itch). However, the mechanism of ESCRT-III recruitment in this context remains elusive. In this study, we tested the arrestin-related trafficking (ART) proteins, namely, ARRDC1 (arrestin domain-containing protein 1) to ARRDC4 and TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein), for their ability to function as adaptors between HECT ubiquitin ligases and the core ESCRT machinery in PPXY-dependent budding. We present several lines of evidence in support of such a role: ARTs interact with HECT ubiquitin ligases, and they also exhibit multiple interactions with components of the ESCRT pathway, namely, ALIX and Tsg101, and perhaps with an as yet unidentified factor. Additionally, the ARTs can be recruited to the site of viral budding, and their overexpression results in a PPXY-specific inhibition of MLV budding. Lastly, we show that WWP1 changes the ubiquitination status of ARRDC1, suggesting that the ARTs may provide a platform for ubiquitination in PPXY-dependent budding. Taken together, our results support a model whereby ARTs are involved in PPXY-mediated budding by interacting with HECT ubiquitin ligases and providing several alternative routes for ESCRT-III recruitment.",,"['Rauch, Susanne', 'Martin-Serrano, Juan']","['Rauch S', 'Martin-Serrano J']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, King's College London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['G0802777/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101229,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Arrestins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arrestins/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Mice', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Virus Release']",PMC3067843,2010/12/31 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02045-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02045-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(7):3546-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02045-10.

The primary MLV determinants responsible have been mapped to within the env gene; however, it has remained unclear how env mediates disease, whether non-Env viral components are required, and what central nervous system (CNS) cells constitute the critical CNS targets. To address these questions, we examined the effect of transplanting engraftable C17.2 neural stem cells engineered to pseudotype, disseminate, and trans-complement neurovirulent (CasBrE, CasE, and CasES) or non-neurovirulent (Friend and SFF-FE) env sequences (SU or SU/TM) within the CNS using either the ""non-neurovirulent"" amphotropic helper virus, 4070A, or pgag-polgpt (a nonpackaged vector encoding Gag-Pol). These studies revealed that acute MLV-induced spongiosis results from two separable activities of Env. First, Env causes neuropathology through unique viral targeting within the CNS, which was efficiently mediated by ecotropic Envs (CasBrE and Friend), but not 4070A amphotropic Env. Second, Env induces spongiosis through a toxin activity that is MLV-receptor independent and does not require the coexpression of other viral structural proteins. CasBrE and 4070A Envs possess the toxin activity, whereas Friend Env does not. Although the identity of the critical viral target cell(s) remains unresolved, our results appear to exclude microglia and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, while implicating viral entry into susceptible neurons. Thus, MLV-induced disease parallels prionopathies in that a single protein, Env, mediates both the CNS targeting and the toxicity of the infectious agent that manifests itself as progressive vacuolar neurodegeneration.",,"['Li, Ying', 'Cardona, Sandra M', 'Traister, Russell S', 'Lynch, William P']","['Li Y', 'Cardona SM', 'Traister RS', 'Lynch WP']","['Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, NEOUCOM, Rootstown, OH 44272, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS037614-10/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS37614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101229,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Stem Cells/pathology/virology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virulence']",PMC3067788,2010/12/31 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02210-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02210-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Mar;85(5):2060-78. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02210-10.

Aberrant expression of Evi-1 has been reported in up to 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and is a diagnostic marker that predicts a poor outcome. Although chromosomal rearrangement involving the Evi-1 gene is one of the major causes of Evi-1 activation, overexpression of Evi-1 is detected in a subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia patients without any chromosomal abnormalities, which indicates the presence of other mechanisms for Evi-1 activation. In this study, we found that Evi-1 is frequently up-regulated in bone marrow cells transformed by the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) chimeric genes MLL-ENL or MLL-AF9. Analysis of the Evi-1 gene promoter region revealed that MLL-ENL activates transcription of Evi-1.

Retinoids and RARA activity have been implicated in hematopoietic self-renewal and neutrophil maturation. We and others therefore predicted that RARA haploinsufficiency would contribute to APL pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we crossed Rara(+/-) mice with mice expressing PML (promyelocytic leukemia)-RARA from the cathepsin G locus (mCG-PR). We found that Rara haploinsufficiency cooperated with PML-RARA, but only modestly influenced the preleukemic and leukemic phenotype. Bone marrow from mCG-PR(+/-) x Rara(+/-) mice had decreased numbers of mature myeloid cells, increased ex vivo myeloid cell proliferation, and increased competitive advantage after transplantation. Rara haploinsufficiency did not alter mCG-PR-dependent leukemic latency or penetrance, but did influence the distribution of leukemic cells; leukemia in mCG-PR(+/-) x Rara(+/-) mice presented more commonly with low to normal white blood cell counts and with myeloid infiltration of lymph nodes. APL cells from these mice were responsive to all-trans retinoic acid and had virtually no differences in expression profiling compared with tumors arising in mCG-PR(+/-) x Rara(+/+) mice.

Prominent clinical features of T-LGL leukemia include neutropenia, anemia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The terminal effector memory phenotype (CD3(+)/CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)CD57(+)) of T-LGL suggests a pivotal chronic antigen-driven immune response. LGL survival is then promoted by platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-15, resulting in global dysregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced cell death. These pathogenic features explain why treatment of T-LGL leukemia is based on immunosuppressive therapy. The majority of these patients eventually need treatment because of severe or symptomatic neutropenia, anemia, or RA. No standard therapy has been established because of the absence of large prospective trials. The authors use low-dose methotrexate initially for T-LGL leukemia patients with neutropenia and/or RA. We recommend either methotrexate or oral cyclophosphamide as initial therapy for anemia. If treatment is not successful, patients are switched to either the other agent or cyclosporine.

The aims of the study was to identify mode of human leukemic cell death induced by ZEA and the mechanisms involved. METHODS: Cell cytotoxicity of ZEA on human leukemic HL-60, U937 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Reactive oxygen species production, cell cycle analysis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction was determined by employing 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, propidium iodide and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide and flow cytometry, respectively. Caspase-3 and -8 activities were detected by using fluorogenic Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) and Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (IETD-AMC) substrates, respectively. Protein expression of cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was performed by Western blot. The expression of proteins was assessed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (PAGE) coupled with LC-MS2 analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach. RESULTS: ZEA was cytotoxic to U937 > HL-60 > PBMCs and caused subdiploid peaks and G1 arrest in both cell lines. Apoptosis of human leukemic HL-60 and U937 cell apoptosis induced by ZEA was via an activation of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c through mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction, activation of caspase-3 and -8, production of reactive oxygen species and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Bax was up regulated in a time-dependent manner and there was down regulation of Bcl-xL expression. Two-dimensional PAGE coupled with LC-MS2 analysis showed that ZEA treatment of HL-60 cells produced differences in the levels of 22 membrane proteins such as apoptosis inducing factor and the ER stress proteins including endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, heat shock protein 90 and calreticulin, whereas only ERp29 mRNA transcript increased.

Viruses induce type I IFNs that initiate signaling to the OAS genes. OAS proteins are pathogen recognition receptors for the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern, double-stranded RNA. Double-stranded RNA activates OAS to produce p(x)5'A(2'p5'A)(n); x = 1-3; n > 2 (2-5A) from ATP. Upon binding 2-5A, RNase L is converted from an inactive monomer to a potently active dimeric endoribonuclease for single-stranded RNA. RNase L contains, from N- to C-terminus, a series of 9 ankyrin repeats, a linker, several protein kinase-like motifs, and a ribonuclease domain homologous to Ire1 (involved in the unfolded protein response). In the past few years, it has become increasingly apparent that RNase L and OAS contribute to innate immunity in many ways. For example, small RNA cleavage products produced by RNase L during viral infections can signal to the retinoic acid-inducible-I like receptors to amplify and perpetuate signaling to the IFN-beta gene. In addition, RNase L is now implicated in protecting the central nervous system against viral-induced demyelination. A role in tumor suppression was inferred by mapping of the RNase L gene to the hereditary prostate cancer 1 (HPC1) gene, which in turn led to discovery of the xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus. A broader role in innate immunity is suggested by involvement of RNase L in cytokine induction and endosomal pathways that suppress bacterial infections. These newly described findings about RNase L could eventually provide the basis for developing broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs.",,"['Chakrabarti, Arindam', 'Jha, Babal Kant', 'Silverman, Robert H']","['Chakrabarti A', 'Jha BK', 'Silverman RH']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA044059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA044059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20101229,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (ELAV Proteins)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (ELAVL1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/genetics/metabolism"", 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Demyelinating Diseases/prevention & control', 'ELAV Proteins', 'ELAV-Like Protein 1', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interferons/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Virus Diseases/immunology/metabolism']",PMC3021357,2010/12/31 06:00,2011/05/10 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2010.0120 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011 Jan;31(1):49-57. doi: 10.1089/jir.2010.0120.

SR-4987 cells show a population doubling time of 24.5 +/- 5.4 h, a plating efficiency of 2.87 +/- 1.19%, and under stimulation maintain only in part their multipotency by differentiating towards chondro-osteogenic lineages but not into adipogenic.

Chemokines are vital for directing the movement of circulating leukocytes to the sites of inflammation and are involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory skin diseases. Herein, we investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of PF on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced chemokine production in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) was treated by TNF-alpha with or without PF. PF markedly attenuated TNF-alpha-induced chemokines (including CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL16 and CX3CL1) mRNA expression in HMEC-1. PF also reduced the secretion of these chemokines in culture supernatants. In addition, endothelial activation in the presence of PF markedly blocked the chemotactic activities of TNF-alpha-stimulated HMEC-1 supernatant on promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) or the acute mature monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cell migration. Furthermore, Western blot data revealed TNF-alpha upregulated phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, which was almost completely reversed by PF. Finally, PF inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation to the nucleus. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that PF has an anti-inflammatory ability against TNF-alpha-induced chemokine production and leukocyte migration, which may be at least partly related to the inhibition of NF-kappaB and ERK pathway.

The development of new therapies for pediatric oncology.,555-9,10.1007/s00431-010-1374-5 [doi],"Although cure rates for children with cancer are approximately 70%, improvements in cure rates have slowed in the past decade, likely due to our inability to further improve outcome using currently available drugs. Novel drug approaches are needed for children with difficult-to-treat malignancies, such as stage IV neuroblastoma, sarcomas, brain tumors, and relapsed leukemia. Several novel agents show promise for improving outcome in patients with either high risk or recurrent disease. For leukemia, inhibitors of cell cycle progression, such as clofarabine and nelarabine, have shown great promise in their ability to increase treatment efficacy in high-risk disease. Targeted agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, DNA binding compounds (trabectedin), and monoclonal antibodies (GD2 inhibitors for neuroblastoma and anti-CD22 antibodies for pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)) also show promise for future treatment. Extensive reviews of each of these agents are presented elsewhere; this article provides an overview of molecular agents at different stages of FDA/EMA approval; those that are currently approved for use in children, currently approved for use in adults, as well as those that show promise in early clinical trial testing, or are supported by strong preclinical data.",,"['Horton, Terzah M', 'Berg, Stacey L']","['Horton TM', 'Berg SL']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, 1102 Bates, Suit 750, Houston, TX 77030, USA. tmhorton@txccc.org""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101230,Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pediatrics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,2010/12/31 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-010-1374-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2011 May;170(5):555-9. doi: 10.1007/s00431-010-1374-5.

Therefore, active and tolerable treatments for patients with relapsed or refractory disease are needed. Bendamustine, a mechlorethamine alkylator with novel mechanisms of action, is approved in the United States for rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell NHL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 2 North American multicenter studies with similar design, enrollment, and response criteria were pooled to evaluate safety and durability of response. Bendamustine was administered at 120 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 every 21 days for 6-8 cycles. Endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS: The studies enrolled 161 patients with a median of 2 previous chemotherapy regimens. Histologies included follicular (68%), small lymphocytic (20%), marginal zone (11%), and lymphoplasmacytic (1%) lymphoma. Sixty patients (34.1%) were refractory to their last chemotherapy, 53 (30.1%) were alkylating agent refractory. Overall response rate was 76% with 23% complete remissions (CRs) and unconfirmed CR (CRu). The median follow-up was 25.3 months (range, 24-27.8 months) and DOR was 10 months (range, 8.3-14 months). At 1 and 2 years, 45% and 23% of responders continued to respond. Among 127 patients previously treated with alkylators, ORR was 88% (28% CR/CRu) in responsive and 59% (12% CR/CRu) in refractory patients. Fifty opportunistic infections were reported in 48 patients. Second malignancies occurred in 9 patients (5.6%; 5 myelodysplastic syndromes, 2 acute myelogenous leukemia, 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 1 squamous cell carcinoma). CONCLUSION: Bendamustine induces durable responses with acceptable long-term safety in rituximab-refractory indolent NHL.",,"['Cheson, Bruce D', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Kahl, Brad S', 'Van der Jagt, Richard H', 'Tremmel, Lothar']","['Cheson BD', 'Friedberg JW', 'Kahl BS', 'Van der Jagt RH', 'Tremmel L']","['Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, 3800 Reservoir Road N.W., Washington, DC, USA. bdc4@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/12/31 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2010/12/31 06:00'],"['2010/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)70045-3 [pii]', '10.3816/CLML.2010.n.079 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2010 Dec;10(6):452-7. doi: 10.3816/CLML.2010.n.079.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individuals with classic dyskeratosis congenita have the most severe phenotype, characterized by the triad of nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation, and oral leukoplakia. More significantly, these individuals are at very high risk of bone marrow failure, cancer, and pulmonary fibrosis. A mutation in one of six different telomere biology genes can be identified in 50-60% of these individuals. DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, and NHP2 encode components of telomerase or a telomerase-associated factor and TINF2, a telomeric protein. Progressively shorter telomeres are inherited from generation to generation in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita, resulting in disease anticipation. Up to 10% of individuals with apparently acquired aplastic anemia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also have short telomeres and mutations in TERC or TERT. Similar findings have been seen in individuals with liver fibrosis or acute myelogenous leukemia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Available diagnostic marrow specimens (n = 790) from 1,328 patients enrolled in three consecutive Children's Cancer Group/Children's Oncology Group trials were analyzed for the presence of SNP rs16754. SNP status was correlated with disease characteristics, WT1 expression level, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: SNP rs16754 was present in 229 (29%) of 790 patients. The SNP was significantly more common in Asian and Hispanic patients and less common in white patients (P < .001). SNP rs16754 was also less common in patients with inv(16) (P = .043) and more common in patients with -5/del(5q) (P = .047). WT1 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with rs16754 or with WT1 mutations compared with WT1 wild-type patients (P = .021). Five-year overall survival (OS) for patients with and without the SNP was 60% and 50%, respectively (P = .031). Prognostic assessment by risk group demonstrated that in patients with low-risk disease, OS for those with and without SNP rs16754 was 90% versus 64% (P < .001) with a corresponding disease-free survival of 72% versus 53% (P = .041). CONCLUSION: The presence of SNP rs16754 was an independent predictor of improved OS; outcome differences were most pronounced in the low-risk subgroup.

These issues have been addressed in a series of 1,347 patients with lymphoma treated with a high-dose sequential (HDS) program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,024 patients with B-cell lymphoma, 234 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 89 patients with T-cell lymphoma were treated with HDS between 1985 and 2005 at 11 Gruppo Italiano Terapie Innovative Linfomi centers. HDS was given as salvage treatment to 707 patients (52%); 655 patients (49%) received a modified HDS, with high-dose cytarabine and two consecutive PBPC harvests. Rituximab-supplemented HDS was given to 523 patients (39%). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 7 years, the median overall survival (OS) was 16.2 years; in B-cell lymphoma the OS was significantly superior with rituximab HDS compared to HDS alone. The cumulative incidence at 5 and 10 years of secondary myelodysplasia/acute leukemia (sMDS/AL) were 3.09% and 4.52%, respectively, that of solid tumors were 2.54% and 6.79%, respectively. Factors associated with sMDS/AL were male sex and use of the second harvest PBPC for the graft; factors found to be associated with solid tumor were advanced age, post-HDS radiotherapy, and rituximab addition to HDS. Despite the increased risk of solid tumors, rituximab addition to HDS was still associated with survival advantages.

Based on encouraging reports of lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we investigated the first-line use of single-agent lenalidomide in CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a starting dose of lenalidomide 10 mg/d for 21 days of a 28-day cycle and weekly 5-mg dose escalations to a target of 25 mg, we encountered severe toxicities (tumor lysis, fatal sepsis) in the first two patients enrolled. The study was halted and the protocol amended to a more conservative regimen: starting dose of lenalidomide 2.5 mg with monthly escalations to a target dose of 10 mg, and extended tumor lysis prophylaxis and monitoring. Gene expression profiles from patient samples before and after 7 days of lenalidomide were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled on the amended protocol. No further tumor lysis events were reported. Tumor flare was common (88%) but mild. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 72% of patients, with only five episodes of febrile neutropenia. The overall response rate was 56% (no complete responses). Although rapid peripheral lymphocyte reductions were observed, rebound lymphocytoses during the week off-therapy were common. Lenalidomide-induced molecular changes enriched for cytoskeletal and immune-related genes were identified.

Although randomized evidence demonstrates that imatinib (a commercially available TKI) prolongs event-free survival in patients with CML, some patients develop imatinib intolerance or resistance. In addition, imatinib is less effective in patients who have progressed to more advanced disease stages, such as accelerated phase and blastic phase CML. For these reasons, 2nd generation TKIs that can inhibit the BCR-ABL protein more effectively or target additional disease mechanisms have been developed. Two such drugs have also been approved for clinical use by the FDA, nilotinib and dasatinib. Resistance to TKI treatment is thought to be mediated through various mechanisms, the most common of which is BCR-ABL1 mutations. Testing for mutations in BCR-ABL1 may predict lack of response to imatinib or may inform the choice between alternative TKIs.",,"['Terasawa, Teruhiko', 'Dahabreh, Issa', 'Trikalinos, Thomas A']","['Terasawa T', 'Dahabreh I', 'Trikalinos TA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medicine; ICRHPS, Tufts Medical Center and Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center, Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101207,United States,PLoS Curr,PLoS currents,101515638,,,,PMC3001986,2010/12/29 06:00,2010/12/29 06:01,['2012/03/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1371/currents.RRN1204 [doi]', 'k/-/-/3agaqazrfnz61/2 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Curr. 2010 Dec 7;2:RRN1204. doi: 10.1371/currents.RRN1204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As recent clinical investigation with FMS-like tyrosine-3 inhibitors demonstrated, targeting IK with selective inhibitors can have a modest clinical benefit. Because multiple IKs are active in patients with AML, multikinase inhibitors may provide the necessary inhibition profile to achieve a more sustained clinical benefit. We here describe a method of assessing the activation of several IKs by flow cytometry. In 40 different samples of patients with AML we observed hyper-activated phospho-proteins at baseline, which is modestly increased by adding stem cell factor to AML cells. Finally, AML cells had a significantly different phospho-protein profile compared with cells of the lymphocyte gate.

These diseases not only share overlapping chromosomal abnormalities but also a number of acquired somatic mutations.

Additionally 4q24 chromosomal rearrangements in MPN, including TET2 deletions, have also been observed using conventional cytogenetics. The goal of this study was to investigate the frequency of genomic TET2 rearrangements in MPN using fluorescence in situ hybridization as a more sensitive method for screening and identifying genomic deletions. Among 146 MPN patients, we identified two patients (1.4%) who showed a common 4q24 deletion, including TET2.

A hallmark of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) responses in APL is PML-RARalpha degradation which promotes cell differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that autophagy is a crucial regulator of PML-RARalpha degradation. Inhibition of autophagy by short hairpin (sh) RNA that target essential autophagy genes such as Atg1, Atg5 and PI3KC3 and by autophagy inhibitors (e.g. 3-methyladenine), blocked PML-RARalpha degradation and subsequently granulocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemic cells. In contrast, rapamycin, the mTOR kinase inhibitor, enhanced autophagy and promoted ATRA-induced PML-RARalpha degradation and myeloid cell differentiation. Moreover, PML-RARalpha co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1, which is degraded through autophagy. Furthermore, knockdown of p62/SQSTM1 inhibited ATRA-induced PML-RARalpha degradation and myeloid cell differentiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, samples of unstimulated saliva of 30 leukemia patients who were not on chemotherapy were collected and analyzed for salivary amylase and total protein. The oral manifestations and radiographic changes (OPG) were recorded. The correlation between the oral manifestations and the salivary components (salivary amylase and total protein) was assessed for prognostic significance. RESULTS: In the present study when the mean values of salivary amylase (1280+/-754 U/ml) and total protein (647.2+/-320.7 mg%) were compared with that in control subjects. There was a statistically significant difference for amylase levels (P<.05). On intraoral examination the study subjects showed pallor, gingivitis, gingival enlargement, petechiae, and ecchymosis.

Although hydantoin compounds are studied extensively, there are not many studies that investigate their anticancer properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty hydantoin compounds were evaluated for their efflux modulating effects in cancer cells using a rhodamine 123 accumulation assay and real-time fluorometry based on the intracellular accumulation of ethidium bromide. RESULTS: The 30 derivatives were screened by real-time fluorometry for rhodamine 123 accumulation. Among the selected derivatives, compounds SZ-7, LL-9, BS-1, MN-3, P3, RW-15b, AD-26, RW-13, AD-29 and KF-2 significantly increased the retention of rhodamine 123. Compounds AD-26, AD-29, RW-13, KF-2, BS-1, MN-3, RW-15b and JH-63 showed synergistic effect with doxorubicin on mouse lymphoma cells. Furthermore, compound SZ-7 had indifferent effect with doxorubicin.

Stable transfection of miR-21 induced drug resistance in K562, while suppression of miR-21 in K562/DNR led to enhanced DNR cytotoxicity. Additional experiments indicate that the mechanism of miR-21 drug resistance involves the PI3K/Akt pathway and changes following PTEN protein expression.

Only 30-40% of the potential patients for allogeneic SCT have an HLA identical sibling, due to the fact that families in most of the developed countries are relatively small. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study gives a general model for calculating the needs for allogeneic SCT which, enables calculation of the needs for allogeneic SCT per 1 million inhabitants of Vojvodina on basis of number of potential patients who could be treated by allogeneic SCT The number of beds required for transplanted patients, and of days in hospital per year as well as the estimation of financial aspect of allogeneic SCT have been calculated by means of the cummulative risk method, considering the following parameters: the relative number of patients suffering from ANLL, ALL, CML, CLL and MDS, 45 and 55-year-old and younger, total incidence/ 100,000 inhabitants for each investigated disease and the average number of days in hospital of transplanted patients. RESULTS: Total annual needs for allogeneic SCT for the patients suffering from ANLL, ALL, CML, CLL and MDS together, in transplantation with stem cells from their related donors are 786 days, from the unrelated donors are 306 days, while for nonmyeloablative transplantation with stem cells from their related donors are 558 days and from the unrelated ones are 297 days. CONCLUSION: The general calculating model of the needs for allogeneic SCT could be used as a basis for planning a regional bone marrow donor registry and for creating a similar calculating model of the needs for allogeneic SCT in other diseases treatable by HSCT.",,"['Vojvodic, Svetlana', 'Popovic, Stevan']","['Vojvodic S', 'Popovic S']","['Zavod za transfuziju krvi Vojvodine, Klinicki centar Vojvodine, Novi Sad ssvu@eunet.rs']",['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Living Donors/supply & distribution', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', '*Needs Assessment', 'Serbia', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Yugoslavia']",,2010/12/29 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/12/29 06:00'],"['2010/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/mpns1006333v [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2010 May-Jun;63(5-6):333-9. doi: 10.2298/mpns1006333v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both instances, neoplastic mast cells usually harbor the D816V-mutated variant of KIT. Phenotypically, mast cells in systemic mastocytosis usually express CD25. However, no robust marker that discriminates between aggressive and indolent variants of systemic mastocytosis has been identified yet. We here report that CD30, also known as Ki-1 antigen, is expressed in neoplastic mast cells in a majority of patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (11/13, 85%), whereas in most patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (12/45, 27%; P<0.001), only a few if any mast cells stained positive for CD30. These results could be confirmed by TissueFAXS analysis in subsets of patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (n=7) and advanced systemic mastocytosis (n=4; P=0.008). The mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1, derived from a patient with aggressive systemic mastocytosis also expressed the CD30 protein. In addition, we were able to detect CD30 mRNA in HMC-1 cells as well as in bone marrow biopsy samples in patients with systemic mastocytosis. In contrast, CD30 transcripts could not be detected in bone marrow biopsies in cases of reactive mast cell hyperplasia and in various other myeloid neoplasms. In conclusion, CD30 is preferentially expressed in neoplastic mast cells in advanced mast cell neoplasms. Upregulated expression of CD30 in advanced systemic mastocytosis may thus be employed as a potential marker for grading systemic mastocytosis in hematopathology.",,"['Sotlar, Karl', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Petat-Dutter, Karina', 'Hessel, Harald', 'Berezowska, Sabina', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Valent, Peter', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Sotlar K', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Petat-Dutter K', 'Hessel H', 'Berezowska S', 'Mullauer L', 'Valent P', 'Horny HP']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.

The immune deficiency ensuing hHSCT renders patients susceptible to life-threatening infections and disease recurrence. Adoptive immunotherapy can restore/enhance early post-transplantation immunocompetence of hHSCT recipients. Efforts are directed to identify strategies for inducing graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response, while avoiding graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurrence. CD1d-restricted invariant iNKT cells are innate-like, lipid-reactive T lymphocytes implicated in the control of innate and adaptive immunity. Preclinical data suggest that iNKT cells positively modulate both GVL response and GVHD. Our recent findings in a cohort of 22 children given hHSCT for different hematological malignancies show that failure to reconstitute iNKT cells after transplantation correlates with leukemia relapse. In this review, we will discuss potential new options for adoptively transferring donor-derived iNKT cells into hHSCT recipients in the early post-transplantation period to prevent disease recurrence.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Previous investigations have verified that it is not sufficient for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to have registry of anthropometric measurements such as age, weight, and height. Given the previous information, it is necessary to conduct studies with nutritional indicators that contribute to understanding their importance in children with ALL. OBJECTIVE: To compare the nutritional values of five indicators of children with and without ALL. METHODS: A sample of 21 children with a diagnosis of ALL and 54 children without ALL (control) participated in the study; the children's ages ranged between 1.3 to 10 years. Comparisons between cases and controls were performed. RESULTS: Indicators of albumin and triceps skin fold showed differences between the groups (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL at time of diagnosis had nutritional deficiencies of subcutaneous fat reserve and protein.

Nilotinib has shown competitive inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 2C9 in vitro, but its effect on CYP2C9 activity in humans is unknown. This study evaluated the effects of nilotinib on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin, a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects (six female, 18 male, aged 21-65 years) were enrolled to receive a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg with either a single oral dose of nilotinib 800 mg or matching placebo (all administered 30 minutes after consumption of a high-fat meal) in a crossover design. Serial blood samples were collected post-dose for determining serum concentrations of nilotinib and plasma concentrations of S- and R-warfarin. Prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) values were determined as pharmacodynamic measures of warfarin activity. CYP2C9 genotyping was performed in all subjects using TaqMan(R) assay. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects were identified as CYP2C9 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and eight as intermediate metabolizers (IMs). There were no CYP2C9 poor metabolizers. Pharmacokinetic parameters of S- and R-warfarin were similar between the two treatments (warfarin + nilotinib vs warfarin alone) in both the EM and the IM groups. The geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) for the maximum concentration in plasma (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) of S-warfarin in plasma in all subjects were 0.98 (0.95, 1.02) and 1.03 (0.99, 1.07), respectively, and for R-warfarin 1.00 (0.96, 1.04) and 1.02 (0.99, 1.04), respectively. Mean ratios for the maximum observed value and AUC from time zero to the last sampling time for PT were 1.00 (0.96, 1.04) and 1.00 (0.98, 1.02), respectively, and for the maximum observed value for INR and the AUC from time zero to the last sampling time for INR were 1.00 (0.97, 1.03) and 1.00 (0.99, 1.01), respectively. Mean +/- SD serum nilotinib C(max) was 1872 +/- 560 ng/mL, which is comparable to steady-state C(max) in CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumour patients receiving twice-daily 400 mg doses. Adverse events observed following either treatment were generally consistent with the known safety profiles of both drugs, and no new safety issues were observed. CONCLUSION: The study results demonstrate that nilotinib has no effect on single-dose warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This implies that nilotinib is unlikely to inhibit CYP2C9 activity in human subjects. These findings suggest that warfarin and nilotinib may be used concurrently as needed.",,"['Yin, Ophelia Q P', 'Gallagher, Neil', 'Fischer, Deirdre', 'Zhao, Lily', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Leroy, Elisabeth', 'Golor, Georg', 'Schran, Horst']","['Yin OQ', 'Gallagher N', 'Fischer D', 'Zhao L', 'Zhou W', 'Leroy E', 'Golor G', 'Schran H']","['Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Florham Park, New Jersey, USA.

Targeted disruption of SENP2 impairs the G-S transition required for mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycles during the expansion of trophoblast stem cells and their differentiation into polyploidy cells, respectively. The disruption disturbed the subcellular distribution and SUMO modification of Mdm2, leading to interference with p53 degradation. Here, we further explore the mechanism underlying SENP2-mediated regulation of Mdm2 in p53-induced cellular stress. We identify a specific isoform of SENP2 necessary and sufficient to negatively regulate the p53-dependent transcription and its related stress responses. This isoform-specific effect is attributed to the differential compartmentalization of SENP2. SUMO conjugation of Mdm2 induces its co-localization and association with SENP2 in promyelocytic leukemia bodies. Biochemical studies show that SENP2 catalyzes the desumoylation process of Mdm2. SENP2-dependent regulation of Mdm2 is sensitive to its p53-binding activity.

Our findings indicate that inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) in Bcr-Abl+ cells overcomes IM resistance although the precise mechanism of Jak2 action is unknown. Knocking down Jak2 in Bcr-Abl+ cells reduced levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also the phosphorylation of Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl, and Jak2 overexpression rescued these knockdown effects. Treatment of Bcr-Abl+ cells with Jak2 inhibitors for 4-6 h but not with IM also reduced Bcr-Abl protein and pTyr177 levels. In vitro kinase experiments performed with recombinant Jak2 showed that Jak2 readily phosphorylated Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl (a Jak2 consensus site, YvnV) whereas c-Abl did not. Importantly, Jak2 inhibition decreased pTyr177 Bcr-Abl in immune complexes but did not reduce levels of Bcr-Abl, suggesting that the reduction of Bcr-Abl by Jak2 inhibition is a separate event from phosphorylation of Tyr177. Jak2 inhibition by chemical inhibitors (TG101209/WP1193) and Jak2 knockdown diminished the activation of Ras, PI-3 kinase pathways and reduced levels of pTyrSTAT5.

Enforced HOXB7 expression in MM cells by a lentiviral vector significantly modified their transcriptional and angiogenic profile, checked by combined microarray and angiogenesis PCR analyses, upregulating VEGFA, FGF2, MMP2, WNT5a and PDGFA and downregulating thrombospoindin-2. The pro- and anti-angiogenic HOXB7-related gene signature was also validated in a large independent dataset of MM patients. Accordingly, MM-induced vessel formation was significantly increased by HOXB7 overexpression both in vitro angiogenic and chorioallantoic membrane assays, as well as the HOXB7 silencing by small interfering RNA inhibited the production of angiogenic factors, and the pro-angiogenic properties of MM cells. Finally, in SCID-NOD mice we confirmed that HOXB7 overexpression by MM cells stimulated tumor growth, increased MM-associated angiogenesis and the expression of pro-angiogenic genes by microarray analysis supporting the critical role of HOXB7 in the angiogenic switch in MM.",,"['Storti, P', 'Donofrio, G', 'Colla, S', 'Airoldi, I', 'Bolzoni, M', 'Agnelli, L', 'Abeltino, M', 'Todoerti, K', 'Lazzaretti, M', 'Mancini, C', 'Ribatti, D', 'Bonomini, S', 'Franceschi, V', 'Pistoia, V', 'Lisignoli, G', 'Pedrazzini, A', 'Cavicchi, O', 'Neri, A', 'Rizzoli, V', 'Giuliani, N']","['Storti P', 'Donofrio G', 'Colla S', 'Airoldi I', 'Bolzoni M', 'Agnelli L', 'Abeltino M', 'Todoerti K', 'Lazzaretti M', 'Mancini C', 'Ribatti D', 'Bonomini S', 'Franceschi V', 'Pistoia V', 'Lisignoli G', 'Pedrazzini A', 'Cavicchi O', 'Neri A', 'Rizzoli V', 'Giuliani N']","['Hematology and BMT Center, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101123,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood supply', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/biosynthesis']",,2010/12/25 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2010/12/25 06:00'],"['2010/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010270 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.270 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Mar;25(3):527-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.270.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA instability disorder that is associated with bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer. Although FA cells experience constitutive chromosomal breaks, cell cycle arrest at the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, and an excess of cell death, some patients do become clinically stable, and the mechanisms underlying this, other than spontaneous reversion of the disease-causing mutation, are not well understood. Here we have defined a clonal phenotype, termed attenuation, in which FA patients acquire an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest. Attenuated cells expressed lower levels of CHK1 (also known as CHEK1) and p53. The attenuation could be recapitulated by modulating the ATR/CHK1 pathway, and CHK1 inhibition protected FA cells from cell death. FA patients who expressed the attenuated phenotype had mild bone marrow deficiency and reached adulthood, but several of them eventually developed myelodysplasia or leukemia. Better understanding of attenuation might help predict a patient's clinical course and guide choice of treatment.

In many cases, the GvHD-inducer donors display genetically encoded resistance to the leukemia virus. In human patients only antileukemia and anti-tumor cell immune reactions are mobilized; thus, patients are deprived of immune reactions to a strong exogenous antigen (the elusive human leukemia-sarcoma retroviruses). The innate and adaptive immune systems of mice have to sustain the immunosuppressive effects of leukemia-inducing retroviruses. Human patients due to the lack of leukemiainducing retroviral pathogens (if they exist, they have not as yet been discovered), escape such immunological downgrading. After studying leukemogenic retroviruses in murine and feline (and other mammalian) hosts, it is very difficult to dismiss retroviral etiology for human leukemias and sarcomas. Since no characterized and thus recognized leukemogenic-sarcomagenic retroviral agents are being isolated from the vast majority of human leukemias-sarcomas, the treatment for these conditions in mice and in human patients vastly differ. It is immunological and biological modalities (alpha interferons; vaccines; adoptive lymphocyte therapy) that dominate the treatment of murine leukemias, whereas combination chemotherapy remains the main remission-inducing agent in human leukemias-lymphomas and sarcomas (as humanized monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins move in). Yet, in this apparently different backgrounds in Mus and Homo, GvHD, as a treatment modality, appears to work well in both hosts, by replacing the hosts' anti-leukemia and anti-tumor immune faculties with those of the donor. The clinical application of GvHD in the treatment of human leukemias-lymphomas and malignant solid tumors remains a force worthy of pursuit, refinement and strengthening. Graft engineering and modifications of the inner immunological environment of the recipient host by the activation or administration of tumor memory T cells, selected Treg cells and natural killer (NKT) cell classes and cytokines, and the improved pharmacotherapy of GvHD without reducing its antitumor efficacy, will raise the value of GvHD to the higher ranks of the effective antitumor immunotherapeutical measures. Clinical interventions of HCT/HSCT (hematopoietic cell/stem cell transplants) are now applicable to an extended spectrum of malignant diseases in human patients, being available to elderly patients, who receive non-myeloablative conditioning, are re-enforced by post-transplant donor lymphocyte (NK cell and immune T cell) infusions and post-transplant vaccinations, and the donor cells may derive from engineered grafts, or from cord blood with reduced GvHD, but increased GvL/GvT-inducing capabilities (graft-versus leukemia/tumor). Post-transplant T cell transfusions are possible only if selected leukemia antigen-specific T cell clones are available. In verbatim quotation: ""Ultimately, advances in separation of GvT from GvHD will further enhance the potential of allogeneic HCT as a curative treatment for hematological malignancies"" (Rezvani, A.R. and Storb, R.F., Journal of Autoimmunity 30:172-179, 2008 (see in the text)).

HL consists of two distinct subtypes - classic HL (cHL) and lymphocyte predominant HL (LPHL). CD20 is present in virtually all patients with LPHL, and in a significant minority of patients with cHL. In this CD20 positive sub-population, the use of rituximab is a rational intervention strategy. Rituximab has been used in patients with cHL as well as LPHL with good efficacy.

Median patient age was 36.1 years. Seventy-six patients were in first complete remission (CR1), and 85 were in second or greater CR or in relapse. Fifty-nine patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A total of 159 patients received chemotherapy plus total body irradiation for conditioning. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis included a calcineurin inhibitor plus methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Sixty of the donors were related, and 101 were unrelated. A total of 110 patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-stimulated peripheral blood, 47 received bone marrow, and 4 received cord blood as the stem cell source. Fifty-five patients relapsed at a median of 231 days after transplantation. The estimated 5-year probabilities of relapse-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were 47%, 30%, and 29%, respectively. By multivariate analyses, transplantation while in CR1 was the most important predictor of successful transplantation. Pretransplantation evidence of minimal residual disease, especially as detected by flow cytometric analysis, was associated with both lower overall survival and lower relapse-free survival. Compared with a similar cohort of patients undergoing transplantation between 1990 and 1997, overall survival was similar for patients undergoing transplantation in CR1, with lower nonrelapse mortality being offset by higher rates of relapse in patients who underwent transplantation more recently.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is unknown whether patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (CAD) may be poor transplant candidates. There are no data analyzing the risk of transplantation in this population. Sixty-nine patients with CAD who underwent 72 transplantations, autologous and allogeneic, were identified retrospectively. Fifty-five percent of these patients had prior percutaneous coronary intervention, 42% had verifiable history of myocardial infarction, and 23% had prior coronary artery bypass grafting. Outcomes were compared to 1109 patients without established CAD who underwent 1183 transplants during the same time period. Cancer diagnoses in the 2 groups were similar, predominantly lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. There was no significant difference between the CAD group and the control group with respect to type of transplant (autologous 68% versus 64%, P = .612, myeloablative 86% versus 85%, P = .867). Treatment-related mortality was no different in the CAD group versus the control group (5.6% versus 4.9%, P = .777), nor were there differences in mortality at 1 year (15.3% versus 16.6%, P = .871), urgent intensive care unit admission (11.1% versus 9.9%, P = .686), or length of stay (25.5 days versus 28.4 days, P = .195).

Our aim was to determine the biological relevance of miR-92a, which has been implicated as an oncomiR in both plasma and leukemia cells in patients with acute leukemia and to evaluate whether it could be a novel biomarker for monitoring these patients. RESULTS: We quantified the expression level of miR-92a in both cells and plasma by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 91 patients with acute leukemia. We also determined miR-92a expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from normal controls. We compared miR-92a expression in plasma with its expression in leukemia cells. Synthetic anti-miR-92a inhibitor was transfected into Raji and OM9;22 cells, and apoptosis was assessed. For in vivo assessment, 6-week-old female nude mice were injected with U937 cells, and miR-92a expression in plasma and tumors was measured. The level of miR-92a expression in fresh leukemia cells was highly variable compared with PBMNC, but significantly lower compared with CD34-positive cells obtained from healthy volunteers. We also noticed that miR-92a was preferentially expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in comparison with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. More specifically, cellular miR-92a expression was significantly increased in a subset of ALL cells, and ALL patients with overexpressed miR-92a had poor prognoses. The anti-miR-92a inhibitor-treated Raji and OM9;22 cells revealed an increase of apoptotic cells. Notably, the cell to plasma ratio of miR-92a expression was significantly higher in both AML and ALL cells compared with PBMNC from healthy volunteers. In tumor-bearing mice, the plasma miR-92a level was significantly decreased in accordance with tumor growth, while tumor tissue was strongly positive for miR-92a. CONCLUSIONS: The miR-92a expression in leukemia cells could be a prognostic factor in ALL patients. The inverse correlation of miR-92a expression between cells and plasma and the cell to plasma ratio may be important to understanding the clinical and biological relevance of miR-92a in acute leukemia.",,"['Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Hamamura, Ryoko S', 'Tanaka, Masami', 'Kuroda, Masahiko', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Umezu T', 'Kobayashi C', 'Hamamura RS', 'Tanaka M', 'Kuroda M', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. junko@hh.iij4u.or.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101224,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,,,PMC3022817,2010/12/25 06:00,2010/12/25 06:01,['2010/12/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-0500-3-347 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-3-347 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2010 Dec 24;3:347. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-3-347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These achievements have provided new opportunities for the development of innovative, more effective therapies. Novel agents potentially useful in the treatment of patients with AML include new formulations of established drugs, newer nucleoside analogs, molecular target drugs, monoclonal antibodies and other agents. Three newer nucleoside analogs, clofarabine, troxacitabine and sapacitabine have been recently investigated in patients with AML. Two methylation inhibitors, 5-azacyticline and decitabine are pyrimidine nucleoside analogs of cytidine which can be incorporated into RNA and/or DNA. Lower doses of these agents are active in AML and have been extensively investigated, especially in secondary AML and AML in elderly patients. Tipifarnib and lonafarnib are orally available farnesyltransferase inhibitors with in vitro and in vivo activity against AML. In recent years, FLT3 inhibitors, lestaurinib, tandutinib and PKC 412 have been developed and tested in AML. The preclinical observations and clinical studies indicate that FLT3 inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML patients, especially when used in combinations with chemotherapy. Several newer MDR inhibitors, including valspodar (PSC-833) and zosuquidar trihydrochloride have been also tested for the treatment of relapsed AML.

In recent decades, a relevant role for immunosuppressants as anticancer agents has emerged. Especially, rapamycin and its derivatives are used, with successful results, across a variety of tumors. Of note, rapamycin and FK506 bind to FKBP12, and the resulting complexes interfere with distinct intracellular signaling pathways driven, respectively, by the mammalian target of rapamycin and calcineurin phosphatase. These pathways are related to T-cell activation and growth. Hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), particularly in cancers that have lost the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, plays an important pathogenetic role in tumor transformation and growth. The signaling pathway involving calcineurin and nuclear factors of activated T-lymphocytes is also involved in the pathogenesis of different cancer types and in tumor metastasis, providing a rationale for use of FK506 in anticancer therapy. Recent studies have focused on FKBPs in apoptosis regulation: Targeting of FKBP12 promotes apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, FKBP38 knockdown sensitizes hepatoma cells to apoptosis, and FKBP51 silencing overcomes resistance to apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, melanoma, and glioma. Interestingly, derivatives of FK506 that have the same FKBP12-binding properties as FK506 but lack functional immunosuppressant activity, exert the same apoptotic effect as FK506 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.These findings suggest that a direct FKBP inhibition represents a further mechanism of immunosuppressants.' anticancer activity.

Antioxidant properties of plants can help to scavenge reactive oxygen species. The objective of this work was to evaluate the genotoxic, antigenotoxic, tumoricidal, and apoptotic effect of some major phenols (apigenin, bisabolol, and protocatechuic acid) from two medicinal plants, Matricaria chamomilla and Uncaria tomentosa. The wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster was used to evaluate the genotoxicity and antigenotoxicity of the three phenols. The human model of HL-60 leukemia cells was used for the assessment of the cytotoxic effect, growth, and cellular viability. The apoptotic effect was evaluated using a DNA fragmentation assay based on the formation of internucleosomal units. Protocatechuic acid (0.25 and 1 mM), apigenin (0.46 and 1.85 mM), and bisabolol (0.56 and 2.24 mM) did not exhibit any genotoxic effect. The three phenols showed an antigenotoxic effect against the hydrogen peroxide effect and also exhibited tumoricidal activity.

For about 30 years, 'classical' models of blood cell development have envisaged a branching tree with two trunks representing the two major families of cells: myeloid/erythroid and lymphoid. Recent debate about this apparent dichotomy has given rise to new models of haematopoiesis and new ways of viewing stem-cell behaviour. These suggest that stem and progenitor cells are more versatile than was first appreciated, so there can be multiple routes to one type of end cell. An important aspect of this versatility during haematopoiesis is that progenitor cells retain an unexpected portfolio of clandestine lineage potentials even when they seem to have progressed quite far along a particular developmental pathway. Here we examine this decision-making process and ask whether, developmentally, leukaemia stem cells are equally or less versatile than their normal counterparts.",,"['Brown, Geoffrey', 'Hughes, Philip J', 'Michell, Robert H', 'Ceredig, Rhodri']","['Brown G', 'Hughes PJ', 'Michell RH', 'Ceredig R']","['School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,,IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",,2010/12/25 06:00,2011/03/30 06:00,['2010/12/25 06:00'],"['2010/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408363.2010.530150 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2010 Aug;47(4):171-80. doi: 10.3109/10408363.2010.530150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of CdA and fludarabine nucleoside (FdA) on the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteomes in human Raji lymphoma cells have been determined using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and mass spectrometry. Differentially abundant proteins have provided new insights into CdA- and FdA-induced apoptosis. Treatment with these purine analogs induced changes in proteins involved with intermediary metabolism, cell growth, signal transduction, protein metabolism, and regulation of nucleic acids. Differentially abundant mitochondrial 39S ribosomal protein L50, mTERF domain-containing protein 1, Chitinase-3 like 2 protein, and ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ9 have been identified in cells undergoing apoptosis. Up-regulation of several stress-associated proteins found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) including GRP78, ERp57, and ORP150 suggests that purine analog-induced apoptosis may result from ER stress and unfolded protein response.

Inducible phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt activation promotes resistance to ATO. In the present study, we evaluated whether E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, a negative regulator of PI3K activation, is involved in the action of ATO. The effect of ATO on cell viability was measured by the Trypan blue exclusion assay or by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and protein expression was assayed by Western blotting. ATO decreased the viability of HL60 cells and induced cellular apoptosis, which was accompanied by transient activation of Akt. The PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, significantly increased ATO-induced apoptosis (P < 0.05). In addition, ATO up-regulated the expression of Cbl-b proteins. Furthermore, ATO inhibited cell viability with an IC50 of 18.54 muM at 24 h in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells. ATO induced cellular apoptosis with transient activation of Akt and Cbl-b was also up-regulated. Rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells transfected with a dominant negative (DN) Cbl-b mutation showed overexpression of Cbl-b (DN) and enhanced Akt activation. Compared with cells transfected with vector, ATO-induced apoptosis was decreased and G2/M phase cells were increased at the same concentration (P < 0.05). The PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, re-sensitized Cbl-b (DN) overexpressing cells to ATO and reversed G2/M arrest (P < 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that Cbl-b potentiates the apoptotic action of ATO by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway.",,"['Yingchun, Li', 'Xiujuan, Qu', 'Jinglei, Qu', 'Ye, Zhang', 'Jing, Liu', 'Yuee, Teng', 'Xuejun, Hu', 'Kezuo, Hou', 'Yunpeng, Liu']","['Yingchun L', 'Xiujuan Q', 'Jinglei Q', 'Ye Z', 'Jing L', 'Yuee T', 'Xuejun H', 'Kezuo H', 'Yunpeng L']","['Department of Medical Oncology, China Medical University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101217,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/12/25 06:00,2012/07/03 06:00,['2010/12/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2010007500142 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2010007500142 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2011 Feb;44(2):105-11. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2010007500142.

The current standard treatment for CLL is a combination regimen containing purine analogues and monoclonal antibodies. Although response rates to such regimens in previously untreated patients are high, patients with CLL invariably experience relapse and often acquire high-risk chromosomal abnormalities.

The demographic profile, clinical data from for each individual in the cohort were statistically collated and analyzed. A P <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 72 participants (45 males and 27 females), aged 32.7 +/- 9.8 years (range, 18 years to 72 years). Leukemic ophthalmopathy was present in 77.8% of subjects. The leading ophthalmic manifestations of leukemia were retinal vascular abnormalities in 50.0% of subjects, conjunctival pallor in 27.8% of subjects, sub-conjunctival hemorrhage in 19.4% of subjects, and retinal hemorrhage in 16.7% of subjects. Ocular co-morbidity was present in 47.2% of subjects. Vision loss occurred in 37.5% of subjects, of which 32.1% was leukemia related, and the remaining due to ocular co-morbidity. Leukemic ophthalmopathy was more prevalent in chronic leukemia (P <0.05), frequently affected the ocular posterior segment (P < 0.05), and often resulted from secondary hematologic complications (P <0.05). There was no gender difference in the prevalence of leukemia (P = 0.0822) or leukemic ophthalmopathy (P = 0.6624). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of leukemic ophthalmopathy in Enugu is high.

It is known that uncontrolled myeloid cell proliferation is also provoked by alteration in other genes, e.g. mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 gene. FLT3 represents the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukaemia. Interestingly, mutated FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) protein is a member of the same signalling pathway as JAK2 protein, the STATS signalling pathway. STAT5 activation is recognized as important for self-renewal of haematopoetic stem cells. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the detection of JAK2-V617F mutation in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Additionally, we investigated the presence of FLT3-ITD mutation in JAK2-V617F-positive patients in order to shed the light on the hypothesis of a similar role of these two molecular markers in haematological malignancies. METHODS: Using allele-specific PCR, 61 patients with known or suspected diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms were tested for the presence of JAK2-V617F mutation. Samples that were positive for JAK2 mutation were subsequently tested for the presence of FLT3-ITD mutation by PCR. RESULTS: Eighteen of 61 analysed patients were positive for JAK2-V617F mutation. Among them, 8/18 samples were diagnosed as polycythaemia vera, and 10/18 as essential thrombocythaemia. None of JAK2-V617F-positive patient was positive for FLT3-ITD mutation. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that one activating mutation is sufficient for aberrant cell proliferation leading to malignant transformation of haematopoetic stem cell.",,"['Spasovski, Vesna', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Kostic, Tatjana', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Colovic, Milica']","['Spasovski V', 'Tosic N', 'Kostic T', 'Pavlovic S', 'Colovic M']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2010/12/25 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/12/25 06:00'],"['2010/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1010614s [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2010 Sep-Oct;138(9-10):614-8. doi: 10.2298/sarh1010614s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, a major concern is that with the increasing use and production of these materials, there may be increased health risks to exposed workers. Long (> 15 microm) straight nanotubes may undergo frustrated phagocytosis which is likely to result in reduced clearance. We examine here the effects of multiwalled carbon nanotubes of different sizes on monocytic THP-1 cells, with regard to their ability to stimulate increased expression of the HO-1 and GST genes and their ability to produce nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf2, as well as the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of inflammation. Our results suggest that long (50 microm) carbon nanotubes (62.5 microg/ml for 4 hours) produce increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased HO-1 gene expression compared with shorter entangled nanotubes. There was no increased gene expression for GST. The long nanotubes (NT1) caused increased release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, an effect which was diminished by the antioxidant trolox, suggesting a role of oxidative stress in the upregulation of this cytokine.

Here we show that, in sharp contrast to the mESCs seeded on the conventional rigid substrates, the mESCs cultured on the soft substrates that match the intrinsic stiffness of the mESCs and in the absence of exogenous LIF for 5 days, surprisingly still generated homogeneous undifferentiated colonies, maintained high levels of Oct3/4, Nanog, and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) activities, and formed embryoid bodies and teratomas efficiently. A different line of mESCs, cultured on the soft substrates without exogenous LIF, maintained the capacity of generating homogeneous undifferentiated colonies with relatively high levels of Oct3/4 and AP activities, up to at least 15 passages, suggesting that this soft substrate approach applies to long term culture of different mESC lines. mESC colonies on these soft substrates without LIF generated low cell-matrix tractions and low stiffness. Both tractions and stiffness of the colonies increased with substrate stiffness, accompanied by downregulation of Oct3/4 expression. Our findings demonstrate that mESC self-renewal and pluripotency can be maintained homogeneously on soft substrates via the biophysical mechanism of facilitating generation of low cell-matrix tractions.",,"['Chowdhury, Farhan', 'Li, Yanzhen', 'Poh, Yeh-Chuin', 'Yokohama-Tamaki, Tamaki', 'Wang, Ning', 'Tanaka, Tetsuya S']","['Chowdhury F', 'Li Y', 'Poh YC', 'Yokohama-Tamaki T', 'Wang N', 'Tanaka TS']","['Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM072744/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM072744/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101213,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biophysics/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'Teratoma/metabolism']",PMC3001487,2010/12/24 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2010/12/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015655 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Dec 13;5(12):e15655. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015655.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, alpha-syntrophin is also expressed in differentiating myoblasts during the early stages of muscle differentiation. In this study, we examined the relationship between the expression of alpha-syntrophin and myogenin, a key muscle regulatory factor. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The absence of alpha-syntrophin leads to reduced and delayed myogenin expression. This conclusion is based on experiments using muscle cells isolated from alpha-syntrophin null mice, muscle regeneration studies in alpha-syntrophin null mice, experiments in Sol8 cells (a cell line that expresses only low levels of alpha-syntrophin) and siRNA studies in differentiating C2 cells. In primary cultured myocytes isolated from alpha-syntrophin null mice, the level of myogenin was less than 50% that from wild type myocytes (p<0.005) 40 h after differentiation induction. In regenerating muscle, the expression of myogenin in the alpha-syntrophin null muscle was reduced to approximately 25% that of wild type muscle (p<0.005). Conversely, myogenin expression is enhanced in primary cultures of myoblasts isolated from a transgenic mouse over-expressing alpha-syntrophin and in Sol8 cells transfected with a vector to over-express alpha-syntrophin. Moreover, we find that myogenin mRNA is reduced in the absence of alpha-syntrophin and increased by alpha-syntrophin over-expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that alpha-syntrophin is localized to the nuclei of differentiating myoblasts. Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that alpha-syntrophin associates with Mixed-Lineage Leukemia 5, a regulator of myogenin expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that alpha-syntrophin plays an important role in regulating myogenesis by modulating myogenin expression.",,"['Kim, Min Jeong', 'Hwang, Sung Ho', 'Lim, Jeong A', 'Froehner, Stanley C', 'Adams, Marvin E', 'Kim, Hye Sun']","['Kim MJ', 'Hwang SH', 'Lim JA', 'Froehner SC', 'Adams ME', 'Kim HS']","['Department of Biological Science, Ajou University, Suwon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS033145/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS33145/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101217,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (syntrophin alpha1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Muscle Cells/cytology', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Myoblasts/*cytology', 'Myogenin/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC3003685,2010/12/24 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2010/12/24 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015355 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Dec 17;5(12):e15355. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015355.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a major limitation of existing chemotherapeutic drugs is the eventual emergence of resistance; hence, the development of novel agents with new mechanisms of action is pertinent. Here, we describe the activity and mechanism of action of pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine-15 (PBOX-15), a novel microtubule-targeting agent, in multiple myeloma cells. METHODS: The anti-myeloma activity of PBOX-15 was assessed using NCI-H929, KMS11, RPMI8226, and U266 cell lines, and primary myeloma cells. Cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial inner membrane depolarisation were analysed by flow cytometry; gene expression analysis was carried out using TaqMan Low Density Arrays; and expression of caspase-8 and Bcl-2 family of proteins was assessed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine-15 induced apoptosis in ex vivo myeloma cells and in myeloma cell lines. Death receptor genes were upregulated in both NCI-H929 and U266 cell lines, which displayed the highest and lowest apoptotic responses, respectively, following treatment with PBOX-15. The largest increase was detected for the death receptor 5 (DR5) gene, and cotreatment of both cell lines with tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), the DR5 ligand, potentiated the apoptotic response. In NCI-H929 cells, PBOX-15-induced apoptosis was shown to be caspase-8 dependent, with independent activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. A caspase-8-dependent decrease in expression of Bim(EL) preceded downregulation of other Bcl-2 proteins (Bid, Bcl-2, Mcl-1) in PBOX-15-treated NCI-H929 cells. CONCLUSION: PBOX-15 induces apoptosis and potentiates TRAIL-induced cell death in multiple myeloma cells.

Here, we used a combination of ChIP sequencing and gene expression profiling to compare the function of TAL1 in normal erythroid and leukaemic T cells. Analysis of the genome-wide binding properties of TAL1 in these two haematopoietic lineages revealed new insight into the mechanism by which transcription factors select their binding sites in alternate lineages. Our study shows limited overlap in the TAL1-binding profile between the two cell types with an unexpected preference for ETS and RUNX motifs adjacent to E-boxes in the T-cell lineage. Furthermore, we show that TAL1 interacts with RUNX1 and ETS1, and that these transcription factors are critically required for TAL1 binding to genes that modulate T-cell differentiation.

Although after solid organ transplantation (SOT) EBV is typically of recipient origin, after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) donor-derived B cells are usually the source of the EBV-induced lymphoproliferation. OBSERVATION: We report a unique presentation of an EBV-associated PTLD in a 13-year-old boy who underwent 2 subsequent HSCTs from 2 different-sex donors for BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and relapses of leukemia, respectively. The PTLD tissue was analyzed for the origin of both B cells and T cells of the lesion. Chimerism analysis done with short tandem repeat systems (STR) showed no autologous signals; approximately 50% of the cells were from the first and second donors, respectively. XY-fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a B-cell PTLD originating from the first donor surrounded by T cells from the second donor. CONCLUSION: This case shows that EBV-infected B cells from a first donor can be the source of a PTLD after a second myeloablative HSCT from a different donor.",,"['Ruf, Stephanie', 'Moser, Olga', 'Wossmann, Wilhelm', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Wagner, Hans-Joachim']","['Ruf S', 'Moser O', 'Wossmann W', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Wagner HJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/virology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology/virology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy/virology', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2010/12/24 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2010/12/24 06:00'],"['2010/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181ed336f [doi]', '00043426-201101000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Jan;33(1):50-4. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181ed336f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of the LBM consists of skeletal muscle, the mass of which is reflected in urinary creatinine excretion. As accurate 24 hours urine collections are challenging in children, we investigated the prospect that serum creatinine concentration provides a measure of LBM. Eleven children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were assessed at 7 time points (6-mo intervals) from diagnosis to 1 year after the completion of therapy. LBM was measured as fat-free mass by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA scans) and correlated with serum creatinine concentration and 24 hours urine creatinine excretion. As expected, there was a strong correlation between 24 hours urinary creatinine excretion and LBM from DXA scans (r=0.79, P<0.001). Serum creatinine concentration also correlated with LBM (r=0.52, P<0.001). Serum creatinine concentration provides a surrogate measure of LBM in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Blocking CD47 with a monoclonal antibody results in phagocytosis of cancer cells and leads to in vivo tumor elimination, yet normal cells remain mostly unaffected. Thus, we postulated that cancer cells must also display a potent pro-phagocytic signal. Here, we identified calreticulin as a pro-phagocytic signal that was highly expressed on the surface of several human cancers, but was minimally expressed on most normal cells. Increased CD47 expression correlated with high amounts of calreticulin on cancer cells and was necessary for protection from calreticulin-mediated phagocytosis. Blocking the interaction of target cell calreticulin with its receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, on phagocytic cells prevented anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Furthermore, increased calreticulin expression was an adverse prognostic factor in diverse tumors including neuroblastoma, bladder cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These findings identify calreticulin as the dominant pro-phagocytic signal on several human cancers, provide an explanation for the selective targeting of tumor cells by anti-CD47 antibody, and highlight the balance between pro- and anti-phagocytic signals in the immune evasion of cancer.",,"['Chao, Mark P', 'Jaiswal, Siddhartha', 'Weissman-Tsukamoto, Rachel', 'Alizadeh, Ash A', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Volkmer, Jens', 'Weiskopf, Kipp', 'Willingham, Stephen B', 'Raveh, Tal', 'Park, Christopher Y', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Chao MP', 'Jaiswal S', 'Weissman-Tsukamoto R', 'Alizadeh AA', 'Gentles AJ', 'Volkmer J', 'Weiskopf K', 'Willingham SB', 'Raveh T', 'Park CY', 'Majeti R', 'Weissman IL']","['Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford Cancer Center, and Ludwig Center at Stanford, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. mpchao@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['T32 CA009302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA139490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1U54CA149145-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (Calreticulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD47 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Calreticulin/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis/*physiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/metabolism']",PMC4126904,2010/12/24 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/12/24 06:00'],"['2010/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['2/63/63ra94 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3001375 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2010 Dec 22;2(63):63ra94. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3001375.,,['NIHMS606288'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the cytokine-evoked membrane expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels are not fully understood. In this study we investigated the role of LIF in promoting the trafficking of T-type Ca(2+) channels in a heterologous expression system. Our results demonstrate that transfection of HEK-293 cells with the rat green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged T-type Ca(2+) channel alpha(1H)-subunit resulted in the generation of transient Ca(2+) currents. Overnight treatment of alpha(1H)-GFP-transfected cells with LIF caused a significant increase in the functional expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels as indicated by changes in current density. LIF also evoked a significant increase in membrane fluorescence compared with untreated cells. Disruption of the Golgi apparatus with brefeldin A inhibited the stimulatory effect of LIF, indicating that protein trafficking regulates the functional expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels. Trafficking of alpha(1H)-GFP was also disrupted by cotransfection of HEK-293 cells with the dominant-negative form of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1 but not ARF6, suggesting that ARF1 regulates the LIF-evoked membrane trafficking of alpha(1H)-GFP subunits. Trafficking of T-type Ca(2+) channels required transient activation of the JAK and ERK signaling pathways since stimulation of HEK-293 cells with LIF evoked a considerable increase in the phosphorylation of the downstream JAK targets STAT3 and ERK. Pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with the JAK inhibitor P6 or the ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked ERK phosphorylation. Both P6 and U0126 also inhibited the stimulatory effect of LIF on T-type Ca(2+) channel expression.

The strongest support for this cancer stem cell model comes from transplantation assays in immunodeficient mice, which indicate that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven by self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs). This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response. RESULTS: Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001). The absolute risk of death by 3 years was 57% (95% CI, 43%-67%) for the low LSC score group compared with 78% (95% CI, 66%-86%) for the high LSC score group (HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; log-rank P = .002). In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006). In multivariate Cox regression including age, mutations in FLT3 and NPM1, and cytogenetic abnormalities, the HRs for LSC score in the 3 cohorts with data on all variables were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P = .02), 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .005), and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P = .005).

Although overall prognosis for pediatric ALL is favorable, high-risk pediatric patients and most adult patients have significantly worse outcomes. Multiagent chemotherapy is standard of care for both pediatric and adult ALL, but is associated with systemic toxicity and long-term side effects and is relatively ineffective against certain ALL subtypes. Recent efforts have focused on the development of targeted therapies for ALL including monoclonal antibodies. Here, we report the identification of CD47, a protein that inhibits phagocytosis, as an antibody target in standard and high-risk ALL. CD47 was found to be more highly expressed on a subset of human ALL patient samples compared with normal cell counterparts and to be an independent predictor of survival and disease refractoriness in several ALL patient cohorts.

ENMD-2076 has selective activity against the mitotic kinase Aurora A, as well as kinases involved in angiogenesis (VEGFRs, FGFRs). ENMD-2076 inhibited the growth in vitro of a wide range of human solid tumor and hematopoietic cancer cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 0.025 to 0.7 mumol/L. ENMD-2076 was also shown to induce regression or complete inhibition of tumor growth in vivo at well-tolerated doses in tumor xenograft models derived from breast, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines. Pharmacodynamic experiments in vivo showed that in addition to inhibiting Aurora A, single doses of ENMD-2076 had sustained inhibitory effects on the activation of Flt3 as well as the angiogenic tyrosine kinases, VEGFR2/KDR and FGFR1 and 2. ENMD-2076 was shown to prevent the formation of new blood vessels and regress formed vessels in vivo at doses equivalent to those that gave substantial activity in tumor xenograft models. These results indicate that ENMD-2076 is a well-tolerated, orally active multitarget kinase inhibitor with a unique antiangiogenic/antiproliferative profile and provides strong preclinical support for use as a therapeutic for human cancers.

However, they can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and rearrangements in the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, which are frequently observed in childhood leukemia. We hypothesize that a deficient DSB repair, as a result of an Atm mutation, may reinforce the clastogenic effect of dietary flavonoids and increase the frequency of Mll rearrangements. Therefore, we examined the effects of in vitro and transplacental exposure to high, but biological amounts of flavonoids in mice with different genetic capacities for DSB repair (homozygous/heterozygous knock-in for human Atm mutation [Atm-DeltaSRI] vs. wild type [wt]). In vitro exposure to genistein/quercetin induced higher numbers of Mll rearrangements in bone marrow cells of Atm-DeltaSRI mutant mice compared with wt mice. Subsequently, heterozygous Atm-DeltaSRI mice were placed on either a flavonoid-poor or a genistein-enriched (270 mg/kg) or quercetin-enriched (302 mg/kg) feed throughout pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to flavonoids associated with higher frequencies of Mll rearrangements and a slight increase in the incidence of malignancies in DNA repair-deficient mice.

This biosensor was based on a 'sandwich' sensing mode, which involved a pair of LNA probes (capture probe immobilized at electrode surface and biotinyl reporter probe as an affinity tag for streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (streptavidin-HRP). Since biotin can be connected with streptavidin-HRP, this biosensor offered an enzymatically amplified electrochemical current signal for the detection of target DNA. In the simple hybridization system, DNA fragment with its complementary DNA fragment was evidenced by amperometric detection, with a detection limit of 74 fM and a linear response range of 0.1-10 pM for synthetic PML/RARalpha fusion gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

Folate-PEG-CHEMS was synthesized by a modified method. The liposome properties, cell cytotoxicity, intracellular and intratumoral localization, and therapeutic efficacy on a murine tumor model bearing L1210JF cells were evaluated. High encapsulation efficiency (95.1%+/-1.5%) and appropriate particle size (76.0+/-35.5nm) and zeta potential (-12.83+/-1.36mV) were achieved for F-L-DNR. IC(50) of F-L-DNR on L1210JF cells was 2-3-folds lower than that of non-targeted liposomal daunorubicin (L-DNR). Anticancer efficacy on L1210JF tumor model indicated that mice survival time of F-L-DNR group at doses of 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg was significantly longer than that of L-DNR or free DNR. Confocal fluorescence photographs of F-L-DNR indicated enhanced endocytosis of liposomes via folate receptor on L1210JF cells, prolonged retaining time in tumors and improved drug release in the tumor site at 24h post intravenous injection of F-L-DNR.

HDACs are frequently recruited to target gene promoters by balanced translocation derived oncogenic fusion proteins. As important epigenetic effector mechanisms, histone deacetylases (HDAC) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. However, the patterns of HDAC1 localization and the role of HDACs in leukemia pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. Using ChIP-Chip analyses we analyzed HDAC1 deposition patterns at more than 10,000 gene promoters in a large cohort of leukemia patients and CD34+ controls. HDAC1 binding was significantly increased in AML blasts compared to CD34+ progenitor cells at 130 gene promoters whereas decreased binding was observed at 66 gene promoters. Distinct HDAC1 binding patterns occurred in AML subtypes with balanced translocations t(15;17), t(8;21) and inv(16). In addition, a more generalized signature was established, that revealed an AML specific pattern of HDAC1 distribution. Many of the HDAC1-binding altered promoters regulate genes involved in hematopoiesis, transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. HDAC1 binding patterns were associated with patients' event free survival. This is the first study to determine HDAC1 modification patterns in a large number of AML and ALL specimens.

Luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay reveal that PU.1 preferentially binds to one of the two putative binding sites on the RIG-G promoter. Moreover, silencing of PU.1 by shRNA markedly inhibited ATRA- but not IFNalpha-induced expression of RIG-G.

METHODS: to retrospectively analyse the clinical datas about the perinatal outcome and the obstetric management of the 16 cases of pregnancy with CML during the last 30 years in a single center. RESULTS: (1) management ang perinatal outcomes: among the 16 pregnancies nine ended with therapeutic abortion during the first or second trimester and no CML complications were observed. The average gestation week was 7 weeks (5 - 13 weeks) when they came to our hospital. Seven pregnancies gave birth, among which CML was diagnosed during pregnancy in four patients and pregnancy was confirmed during CML in three patients. The average gestation week was 36 weeks (27 - 40 weeks(+2)) when they came to our hospital. Among the seven women three were treated with hydroxyurea (one became pregnant while she was on hydroxyurea and she elected to continue her pregnancy and continued to use hydroxyurea), one with leukapheresis twice after her 40 weeks of gestation, one with plateletpheresis and three hadn't any treatment. In the seven pregnacies three developed severe pre-eclampsias, including the two had hydroxyurea during the gestation. The average delivery gestational week was 38 weeks (33 weeks(+4) - 41 weeks), two were premature birth. Two caesarean sections, three vaginal deliveries and two forceps deliveries. There were two postpartum hemorrhage, during the 24 hours the amount of bleeding was 1500 - 1800 ml and secondary disseminated intravascular coagulation happened. Seven patients gave birth to seven infants whose average birth weight was 2469 g (1820 - 2810 g), of whom two were premature infants, two low birth weight infants, one had congenital malformation and two had abnormal blood routine examinations. (2) Management after delivery and prognosis: during the nine patients who ended pregnancy with therapeutic abortion during the first or second trimester four withdraw, one died whose course of disease was 3 years and the other four were alive during 5 months to 72 months, among which one had stem cell transplantation, two are taking imatinib mesylate and one takes hydroxyurea. Among the seven patients who deliveried two withdraw, two died and three are alive. Among the seven infants two withdraw, the other five have normal development following 4 months to 9 years.

However, the multi-drug resistance of the tumor cells caused by chemotherapeutic drugs has seriously affected the effect of chemotherapy. And this is the main reason for the failure of the leukemia treatment. Therefore, to explore an effective way of reversing drug resistance has become the key of leukemia treatment. RNA interference, a system within living cells, helps to determine which genes are active and how active they are. It is a process in which translation of some cell messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences is prevented, because of the presence of (and consequent destruction of) matching double-stranded RNA sequences. RNA interference is also called post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), since its effect on gene expression occurs after the production of mRNA during transcription. It is believed that RNA interference can protect the cell against viruses and other threats. The greatest advantage of RNAi is the specificity and high efficiency which can induce suppression of specific genes of interest but the unrelated genes are not affected. The selective and robust effect of RNAi on gene expression makes it a valuable research tool both in cell culture and living organisms because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can induce the suppression of specific genes of interest.

An initial model for its pathogenesis emphasized the conversion of a hematopoietic transcriptional activator AML1 into a leukemogenic repressor which blocked myeloid differentiation at the level of target gene regulation. Aml1/eto fusion genes inhibit key hematopoietic transcription factor that function as tumor suppressors at several nodal point during hematopoietic differentiation.

The telomere length in 34 leukemia patients versus 20 normal controls was compared by using Flow-FISH, and the relationship between telomere length and therapeutic effect and prognosis was analyzed preliminarily. As for those patients with follow-up samples, the changes of telomere length combined with surface antigen in different courses of disease were observed by multicolor Flow-FISH. The results indicated that the telomere length of de novo patients was significantly shorter than that of controls except the patients in chronic myeloid leukemia-chronic phase (CML-CP). The shorter telomere, the lower complete remission (CR) rates were observed in acute leukemia cases and the shorter duration of CP before onset of blast phase (BP) occurred in CML cases. The acute leukemia patients showed longer telomere and fewer cells expressed the related antigen after CR. The telomere length of cases with continued CR remained at normal level during remission, and there was no increased expression of the specific antigen. However, the telomere of relapsed cases shortened again after relapse with elevated specific antigen expression. In the relapsed cases, the telomere of related antigen positive cells shortened ahead of telomere length change of the whole cells and morphologic change of bone marrow cells. It is concluded that analysis of telomere length by flow-FISH manifests the significance for monitoring disease conditions, estimating prognosis and guiding therapy in all kinds of leukemia.

To identify members of this class of compounds with cytostatic effects, we assessed the effects of the geranylated flavanone tomentodiplacone B (TOM B) on cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulatory pathways of THP-1 human monocytic leukaemia cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cell viability was measured by dye exclusion and proliferation by WST-1 assays; cell cycle was monitored by flow cytometry. Regulatory proteins were assessed by immunoprecipitation and kinase assays, and Western blotting. KEY RESULTS: Tomentodiplacone B had no effect during the first 24 h of cell growth at concentrations between 1 and 2.5 microM, but inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 5 microM or higher. Growth inhibition during the first 24 h of exposure to TOM B was not accompanied by cytotoxicity as cells were accumulated in G1 phase dose-dependently. This G1 phase accumulation was associated with down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity and also protein levels of cyclins E1 and A2. However, key stress-related molecules (gamma-H2AX, p53 and p21) were not induced, suggesting that TOM B acts by directly inhibiting the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 signalling pathway rather than initiating DNA damage or cellular stress. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study provides the first evidence that TOM B directly inhibits proliferation of human monocytic leukaemia cells, and thus is a potential anticancer agent, preventing leukaemia cells from progressing from G1 phase into DNA synthesis.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Posaconazole demonstrated higher efficacy than standard azole agents (SAA) in the prophylaxis of IFI in this population. The authors estimated the cost effectiveness of posaconazole versus SAA in France. METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed to compare posaconazole with SAA with the results of a published clinical trial. Clinical events were modelled with chance nodes reflecting probabilities of IFI, IFI-related death, and death from other causes. Medical resource consumption and costs were obtained from results of the clinical trial and from a dedicated survey on the costs of treating IFI using a retrospective chart review design. RESULTS: IFI treatment costs were estimated using medical files from 50 AML patients from six French centres, with a proven and probable IFI, who had been followed-up for 298 days on average. Direct costs directly related to IFI were estimated at euro51,033, including extra costs of index hospitalisation, costs of antifungal therapy and additional hospitalisations related to IFI treatment. The model indicated that the healthcare costs for the posaconazole strategy were euro5,223 (euro2,697 for prophylaxis and euro2,526 for IFI management), which was euro859 less than the euro6,083 in costs with SAA (euro469 for prophylaxis and euro5614 for IFI management). A sensitivity analysis indicated that there was an 80% probability that prophylaxis using the posaconazole strategy would be superior. CONCLUSION: The findings from this analysis suggest that posaconazole use is a clinically and economically dominant strategy in the prophylaxis of IFI in AML patients, given the usual limits of economic models and the uncertainty of costs estimates.",,"['Michallet, M', 'Gangneux, J P', 'Lafuma, A', 'Herbrecht, R', 'Ribaud, P', 'Caillot, D', 'Dupont, B', 'Moreau, P', 'Berger, P', ""O'Sullivan, A K""]","['Michallet M', 'Gangneux JP', 'Lafuma A', 'Herbrecht R', 'Ribaud P', 'Caillot D', 'Dupont B', 'Moreau P', 'Berger P', ""O'Sullivan AK""]","[""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101223,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*economics', 'Antifungal Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Female', 'France', 'Fungi/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'National Health Programs', 'Triazoles/*economics/therapeutic use']",,2010/12/24 06:00,2011/06/09 06:00,['2010/12/24 06:00'],"['2010/12/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696998.2010.542393 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2011;14(1):28-35. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2010.542393.

However, only a minority of patients treated with imatinib have a complete molecular remission. METHODS: We randomly assigned 636 patients with untreated chronic-phase CML to receive imatinib alone at a dose of 400 mg daily, imatinib (400 mg daily) plus cytarabine (20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day on days 15 through 28 of each 28-day cycle) or pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2a (90 mug weekly), or imatinib alone at a dose of 600 mg daily. Molecular and cytogenetic responses, time to treatment failure, overall and event-free survival, and adverse events were assessed. An analysis of molecular response at 12 months was planned. A superior molecular response was defined as a decrease in the ratio of transcripts of the tyrosine kinase gene BCR-ABL to transcripts of ABL of 0.01% or less, corresponding to a reduction of 4 log(10) units or more from the baseline level, as assessed by means of a real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: At 12 months, the rates of cytogenetic response were similar among the four groups. The rate of a superior molecular response was significantly higher among patients receiving imatinib and peginterferon alfa-2a (30%) than among patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib alone (14%) (P=0.001). The rate was significantly higher among patients treated for more than 12 months than among those treated for 12 months or less. Gastrointestinal events were more frequent among patients receiving cytarabine, whereas rash and depression were more frequent among patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with other treatments, the addition of peginterferon alfa-2a to imatinib therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of molecular response in patients with chronic-phase CML.

Histamine dihydrochloride inhibits the formation of reactive oxygen species that suppress the activation of T cells and natural killer cells. When administered in addition to the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2, histamine dihydrochloride enables the activation of T cells and natural killer cells by IL-2, resulting in the killing of tumour cells of various cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a 3-year, randomized, multicentre, phase III trial in adult patients with AML in first or subsequent remission, those who received subcutaneous histamine dihydrochloride and concomitant subcutaneous IL-2 as maintenance therapy had a significantly longer leukaemia-free survival (LFS; primary endpoint) than recipients of no treatment. This difference was also shown for the subgroup of patients in first remission. The between-group difference in overall survival (OS) was not significant, although this trial was not powered to detect such a difference. Histamine dihydrochloride and IL-2 therapy had an acceptable tolerability profile in patients in the phase III trial. The majority of reported adverse events were grade 1 or 2 of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. The most commonly reported grade 3 adverse events with active treatment were thrombocytopenia, headache, neutropenia, pyrexia, eosinophilia and diarrhoea; grade 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia and leukopenia not otherwise specified.

The addition of taxanes, and subsequently trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing patients, to anthracyclines further improved their efficacy in several studies involving high-risk early breast cancer patients. Concern over toxicity initially surfaced after anthracyclines were reported to carry an increased risk of cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia. Trastuzumab has since been shown to compound the risk of cardiotoxicity in patients who have received an anthracycline. This has led to the development of regimens featuring a taxane without an anthracycline; these protocols vary in design and have different toxicity and efficacy profiles. Ongoing investigations are centered on the optimization of nonanthracycline regimens, prospective exploration of molecular markers to identify populations of patients who will derive maximal benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and the identification of less cardiotoxic formulations of existing anthracycline agents.

Although excellent response rates are achieved with standard chemoimmunotherapy, patients often relapse and additional treatment is necessary. Bendamustine, a unique cytotoxic agent with alkylating and antimetabolite properties, has been used for decades in Germany for NHL, CLL and multiple myeloma. In 2008, bendamustine was approved by the US FDA for the treatment CLL and rituximab-refractory indolent B-cell NHL. The approval in NHL was based on the results of this multicenter, single-arm trial in which patients with rituximab-refractory indolent NHL received bendamustine 120 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle for six to eight cycles. The primary end points were overall response rate and median duration of response, and the secondary end points were progression-free survival and the safety profile. Bendamustine demonstrated significant efficacy with an overall response rate of 75% median duration of response of 9.2 months and median progression-free survival of 9.3 months, as well as easy tolerability.

We demonstrate that transfection of T cells with messenger (m) RNA coding for CAR is an alternative strategy. METHODS: We describe the pre-clinical evaluation of a method based on transient modification of expanded T cells with a CD19 CAR directed against B-cell malignancies. CAR mRNA was generated under cell-free conditions in a scalable process using recombinant RNA polymerase. Efficient and non-toxic square-wave electroporation was used to load the mRNA into the cytoplasm of T cells with no risk of insertional mutagenesis. RESULTS: After transfection >80% of T cells were viable, with 94% CAR expression. Transfected T cells were cytolytic to CD19(+) targets and produced interferon (IFN)-gamma in response. Killing of CD19(+) target cells was demonstrated even at day 8 with undetectable CAR expression. Increasing the concentration of mRNA resulted in higher surface CAR expression, better killing and more IFN-gamma release but at the expense of increased activation-induced cell death. Finally, we demonstrated that a second transgene could be introduced by co-electroporation of CXCR4 or CCR7 with CAR to also modify chemotactic responses. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate the transient redirection approach as well suited to meet safety aspects for early phase studies, prior to trials using stably transduced cells once CAR has been proven safe. The simplicity of this methodology also facilitates rapid screening of candidate targets and novel receptors in pre-clinical studies.",,"['Almasbak, Hilde', 'Rian, Edith', 'Hoel, Hanna Julie', 'Pule, Martin', 'Walchli, Sebastien', 'Kvalheim, Gunnar', 'Gaudernack, Gustav', 'Rasmussen, Anne-Marie']","['Almasbak H', 'Rian E', 'Hoel HJ', 'Pule M', 'Walchli S', 'Kvalheim G', 'Gaudernack G', 'Rasmussen AM']","['Section for Immunology, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. hilde.almasbak@rr-research.no']",['eng'],['G0501935/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101221,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen/*genetics', 'Receptors, CCR7/*genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2010/12/23 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2010/12/23 06:00'],"['2010/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2010.542461 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(11)70543-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2011 May;13(5):629-40. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2010.542461.

But in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell lines KIBRA showed frequent hypermethylation and silencing of gene expression, which could be reversed by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In ALL patient samples KIBRA was methylated in 70% B-ALL but was methylated in < 20% T-ALL leukemia (p = 0.0019). In B-ALL KIBRA methylation was associated with ETV6/RUNX1 [t(12;21) (p13;q22)] chromosomal translocation (p = 0.0082) phenotype, suggesting that KIBRA may play an important role in t(12;21) leukemogenesis. In ALL paired samples at diagnosis and remission KIBRA methylation was seen in diagnostic but not in any of the remission samples accompanied by loss of KIBRA expression in disease state compared to patients in remission. Hence KIBRA methylation occurs frequently in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia but not in epithelial cancers and is linked to specific genetic event in B-ALL.",,"['Hill, Victoria K', 'Dunwell, Thomas L', 'Catchpoole, Daniel', 'Krex, Dietmar', 'Brini, Anna T', 'Griffiths, Mike', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Maher, Eamonn R', 'Latif, Farida']","['Hill VK', 'Dunwell TL', 'Catchpoole D', 'Krex D', 'Brini AT', 'Griffiths M', 'Craddock C', 'Maher ER', 'Latif F']","['Medical and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Research, School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110301,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (WWC1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (hpo protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3092681,2010/12/22 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2010/12/22 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['14404 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.6.3.14404 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2011 Mar;6(3):326-32. doi: 10.4161/epi.6.3.14404.

Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (FCM) facilitates a rapid diagnosis, but commonly used criteria are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific. With an antibody panel for diagnostic screening in routine practice, we found all 149 APL cases in this study exhibited a unique immunophenotypic profile, ie, a characteristic CD11b- myeloid population and absent CD11c expression in all myeloid populations; 96.6% of cases also lacked HLA-DR expression. These distinctive features allowed recognition of all unusual cases phenotypically resembling the regular myeloblasts (CD34+/HLA-DR+) or granulocytes (CD117-/CD34-/HLA-DR-). FCM effectively identified all 19 APL cases with variant translocations, including cases with a normal karyotype due to a cryptic submicroscopic t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(11;17)(q23;q21) that escaped the detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(15;17) and der(15)ider(17)(q10) that lacked a simple reciprocal t(15;17).

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an immunoconjugate between CD33 and calicheamicin that is internalized when binding to the epitope. We previously established that it is feasible to combine GO with conventional chemotherapy. We now report a large randomized trial testing the addition of GO to induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy in untreated younger patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label trial, 1,113 patients, predominantly younger than age 60 years, were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of GO (3 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of induction course 1 with one of the following three induction schedules: daunorubicin and cytarabine; cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide; or fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin. In remission, 948 patients were randomly assigned to GO in course 3 in combination with amsacrine, cytarabine, and etoposide or high-dose cytarabine. The primary end points were response rate and survival. RESULTS: The addition of GO was well tolerated with no significant increase in toxicity. There was no overall difference in response or survival in either induction of consolidation. However, a predefined analysis by cytogenetics showed highly significant interaction with induction GO (P = .001), with significant survival benefit for patients with favorable cytogenetics, no benefit for patients with poor-risk disease, and a trend for benefit in intermediate-risk patients.

We reviewed the outcome of older adolescents (age 15 to 18 years) treated in four consecutive Total Therapy studies to determine if recent improved treatment extended to this high-risk group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 2007, 963 pediatric patients, including 89 older adolescents, were enrolled on Total Therapy studies XIIIA, XIIIB, XIV, and XV. In the first three studies, treatment selection was based on presenting clinical features and leukemic cell genetics. In study XV, the level of residual disease was used to guide treatment, which featured intensive methotrexate, glucocorticoid, vincristine, and asparaginase, as well as early triple intrathecal therapy for higher-risk ALL. RESULTS: The 89 older adolescents were significantly more likely to have T-cell ALL, the t(4;11)(MLL-AF4), and detectable minimal residual disease during or at the end of remission induction; they were less likely to have the t(12;21)(ETV6-RUNX1) compared with younger patients. In the first three studies, the 44 older adolescents had significantly poorer event-free survival and overall survival than the 403 younger patients. This gap in prognosis was abolished in study XV: event-free survival rates at 5 years were 86.4% +/- 5.2% (standard error) for the 45 older adolescents and 87.4% +/- 1.7% for the 453 younger patients; overall survival rates were 87.9% +/- 5.1% versus 94.1% +/- 1.2%, respectively.

Promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs, also known as ND10) contribute to host restriction of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication via mechanisms that are counteracted by viral regulatory protein ICP0. ND10 assembly is dependent on PML, which comprises several different isoforms, and depletion of all PML isoforms decreases cellular resistance to ICP0-null mutant HSV-1. We report that individual expression of PML isoforms I and II partially reverses the increase in ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation that occurs in PML-depleted cells. This activity of PML isoform I is dependent on SUMO modification, its SUMO interaction motif (SIM), and each element of its TRIM domain. Detailed analysis revealed that the punctate foci formed by individual PML isoforms differ subtly from normal ND10 in terms of composition and/or Sp100 modification. Surprisingly, deletion of the SIM motif from PML isoform I resulted in increased colocalisation with other major ND10 components in cells lacking endogenous PML. Our observations suggest that complete functionality of PML is dependent on isoform-specific C-terminal sequences acting in concert.",,"['Cuchet, Delphine', 'Sykes, Amanda', 'Nicolas, Armel', 'Orr, Anne', 'Murray, Jill', 'Sirma, Huseyin', 'Heeren, Joerg', 'Bartelt, Alexander', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Cuchet D', 'Sykes A', 'Nicolas A', 'Orr A', 'Murray J', 'Sirma H', 'Heeren J', 'Bartelt A', 'Everett RD']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],['MC_U130169966/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101220,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpes Simplex/*metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3010193,2010/12/22 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2010/12/22 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.075390 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.075390 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Jan 15;124(Pt 2):280-91. doi: 10.1242/jcs.075390.

METHODS: Using lentiviral vector systems to construct lentiviral vectors of human PTEN gene for RNAi and its RESC concurrent rescue, human T-lymphocytes were transfected with the lentiviruses. The cell models were established with PTEN gene knockdown (T-LC-shPTEN) and RESC concurrent rescue (T-LC-rrshPTEN). After knockdown and RESC concurrent rescue of PTEN gene, the expression of PTEN protein and the activation of AKT signal pathway, cell proliferation and cell cycle were detected by Western blot, MTT assay and flow cytometry respectively. RESULTS: The RNAi-mediated lentiviruses can down-regulate the expression of the human PTEN gene effectively. After the down-regulation of PTEN gene, the T-lymphocytes grew faster. The phase G0/G1 cells decreased and the phases S and G2/M cells increased significantly. The PI3K/AKT signal pathway was activated. All RNAi phenomenon caused by PTEN gene knockdown were recovered fully by RESC concurrent rescue of RNAi.

Although genetic factors are considered to contribute to CLL etiology, at present genomic aberrations identified in CLL are limited compared with those identified in other types of leukemia, which raises the question of the degree of genetic influence on CLL. We performed a high-resolution genome scanning study to address this issue. FINDINGS: Using the restriction paired-end-based Ditag Genome Scanning technique, we analyzed three primary CLL samples at a kilobase resolution, and further validated the results in eight primary CLL samples including the two used for ditag collection. From 51,632 paired-end tags commonly detected in the three CLL samples representing 5% of the HindIII restriction fragments in the genomes, we identified 230 paired-end tags that were present in all three CLL genomes but not in multiple normal human genome reference sequences. Mapping the full-length sequences of the fragments detected by these unmapped tags in seven additional CLL samples confirmed that these are the genomic aberrations caused by small insertions and deletions, and base changes spreading across coding and non-coding regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified hundreds of loci with insertion, deletion, base change, and restriction site polymorphism present in both coding and non-coding regions in CLL genomes, indicating the wide presence of small genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our study supports the use of a whole genome sequencing approach for comprehensively decoding the CLL genome for better understanding of the genetic defects in CLL.",,"['Kim, Yeong C', 'Jung, Yong-Chul', 'Chen, Jun', 'Alhasan, Ali H', 'Kaewsaard, Parawee', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Ma, Shuo', 'Rosen, Steve', 'Wang, San Ming']","['Kim YC', 'Jung YC', 'Chen J', 'Alhasan AH', 'Kaewsaard P', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma S', 'Rosen S', 'Wang SM']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Nebraska, USA. sanming.wang@unmc.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101220,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,,,PMC3016268,2010/12/22 06:00,2010/12/22 06:01,['2010/12/22 06:00'],"['2010/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-0500-3-341 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-3-341 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2010 Dec 20;3:341. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-3-341.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined assay characteristics and the performance of the DASL 502-gene Cancer Panel v1 (1.5K) and 24,526-gene panel (24K) platforms at differentiating nine human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- positive (HER2+) and 11 HER2-negative (HER2-) paraffin-embedded breast tumors. METHODS: Bland-Altman plots and Spearman correlations evaluated intra/inter-panel agreement of normalized expression values. Unequal-variance t-statistics tested for differences in expression levels between HER2 + and HER2 - tumors. Regulatory network analysis was performed using Metacore (GeneGo Inc., St. Joseph, MI). RESULTS: Technical replicate correlations ranged between 0.815-0.956 and 0.986-0.997 for the 1.5K and 24K panels, respectively. Inter-panel correlations of expression values for the common 498 genes across the two panels ranged between 0.485-0.573. Inter-panel correlations of expression values of 17 probes with base-pair sequence matches between the 1.5K and 24K panels ranged between 0.652-0.899. In both panels, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) was the most differentially expressed gene between the HER2 + and HER2 - tumors and seven additional genes had p-values < 0.05 and log2 -fold changes > |0.5| in expression between HER2 + and HER2 - tumors: topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), cyclin a2 (CCNA2), v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 5a (WNT5A), growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7), cell division cycle 2 (CDC2), and baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5). The top 52 discriminating probes from the 24K panel are enriched with genes belonging to the regulatory networks centered around v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1). Network analysis with a two-step extension also showed that the eight discriminating genes common to the 1.5K and 24K panels are functionally linked together through MYC, TP53, and ESR1. CONCLUSIONS: The relative RNA abundance obtained from two highly differing density gene panels are correlated with eight common genes differentiating HER2 + and HER2 - breast tumors.

Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a retrovirus that has been the subject of intense debate since its detection in samples from humans with prostate cancer (PC) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Controversy has arisen from the failure of some studies to detect XMRV in PC or CFS patients and from inconsistent detection of XMRV in healthy controls. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that Taqman PCR primers previously described as XMRV-specific can amplify common murine endogenous viral sequences from mouse suggesting that mouse DNA can contaminate patient samples and confound specific XMRV detection. To consider the provenance of XMRV we sequenced XMRV from the cell line 22Rv1, which is infected with an MLV-X that is indistinguishable from patient derived XMRV. Bayesian phylogenies clearly show that XMRV sequences reportedly derived from unlinked patients form a monophyletic clade with interspersed 22Rv1 clones (posterior probability >0.99). The cell line-derived sequences are ancestral to the patient-derived sequences (posterior probability >0.99). Furthermore, pol sequences apparently amplified from PC patient material (VP29 and VP184) are recombinants of XMRV and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) a virus with an envelope that lacks tropism for human cells. Considering the diversity of XMRV we show that the mean pairwise genetic distance among env and pol 22Rv1-derived sequences exceeds that of patient-associated sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001 for pol and env, respectively). Thus XMRV sequences acquire diversity in a cell line but not in patient samples. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that published XMRV sequences are related by a process of infectious transmission. CONCLUSIONS: We provide several independent lines of evidence that XMRV detected by sensitive PCR methods in patient samples is the likely result of PCR contamination with mouse DNA and that the described clones of XMRV arose from the tumour cell line 22Rv1, which was probably infected with XMRV during xenografting in mice.

We suspected that the kit itself might have been contaminated with small traces of endogenous MLV genome or XMRV and attempted to evaluate the quality of the kit in two independent laboratories. We purchased four one-step RT-PCR kits from Invitrogen, TaKaRa, Promega and QIAGEN in Japan. To amplify the partial gag gene of XMRV or other MLV-related viruses, primer sets (419F and 1154R, and GAG-I-F and GAG-I-R) which have been widely used in XMRV studies were employed. The nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were determined and compared with deposited sequences of a polytropic endogenous MLV (PmERV), XMRV and endogenous MLV-related viruses derived from CFS patients. We found that the enzyme mixtures of the one-step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen were contaminated with RNA derived from PmERV. The nucleotide sequence of a partial gag region of the contaminant amplified by RT-PCR was nearly identical (99.4% identity) to a PmERV on chromosome 7 and highly similar (96.9 to 97.6%) to recently identified MLV-like viruses derived from CFS patients. We also determined the nucleotide sequence of a partial env region of the contaminant and found that it was almost identical (99.6%) to the PmERV.

A more recent study indicated that this infectious retrovirus can be detected in 67% of patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), but only very few healthy controls (4%). However, several groups have published to date that they could not identify XMRV RNA or DNA sequences in other cohorts of CFS patients, while another group detected murine leukemia virus (MLV)-like sequences in 87% of such patients, but only 7% of healthy controls. Since there is a high degree of similarity between XMRV and abundant endogenous MLV proviruses, it is important to distinguish contaminating mouse sequences from true infections. RESULTS: DNA from the peripheral blood of 112 CFS patients and 36 healthy controls was tested for XMRV with two different PCR assays. A TaqMan qPCR assay specific for XMRV pol sequences was able to detect viral DNA from 2 XMRV-infected cells (~ 10-12 pg DNA) in up to 5 mug of human genomic DNA, but yielded negative results in the test of 600 ng genomic DNA from 100,000 peripheral blood cells of all samples tested. However, positive results were obtained with some of these samples, using a less specific nested PCR assay for a different XMRV sequence. DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed a wide variety of virus-related sequences, some identical to those found in prostate cancer and CFS patients, others more closely related to known endogenous MLVs. However, all samples that tested positive for XMRV and/or MLV DNA were also positive for the highly abundant intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) long terminal repeat and most were positive for murine mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase sequences. No contamination was observed in any of the negative control samples, containing those with no DNA template, which were included in each assay.

This virus has been identified in the US in prostate cancer patients and in those with chronic fatigue syndrome. However, with the exception of two patients in Germany, XMRV has not been identified in prostate cancer tissue in Europe. Most putative associations of new or old human retroviruses with diseases have turned out to be due to contamination. We have looked for XMRV sequences in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded prostate tissues. To control for contamination, PCR assays to detect either mouse mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or intracisternal A particle (IAP) long terminal repeat DNA were run on all samples, owing to their very high copy number in mouse cells. RESULTS: In general agreement with the US prevalence, XMRV-like sequences were found in 4.8% of prostate cancers. However, these were also positive, as were 21.5% of XMRV-negative cases, for IAP sequences, and many, but not all were positive for mtDNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that contamination with mouse DNA is widespread and detectable by the highly sensitive IAP assay, but not always with less sensitive assays, such as murine mtDNA PCR. This study highlights the ubiquitous presence of mouse DNA in laboratory specimens and offers a means of rigorous validation for future studies of murine retroviruses in human disease.",,"['Robinson, Mark J', 'Erlwein, Otto W', 'Kaye, Steve', 'Weber, Jonathan', 'Cingoz, Oya', 'Patel, Anup', 'Walker, Marjorie M', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Uiprasertkul, Mongkol', 'Coffin, John M', 'McClure, Myra O']","['Robinson MJ', 'Erlwein OW', 'Kaye S', 'Weber J', 'Cingoz O', 'Patel A', 'Walker MM', 'Kim WJ', 'Uiprasertkul M', 'Coffin JM', 'McClure MO']","[""Section of Infectious Diseases, Jefferiss Research Trust Laboratories, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, London, W2 1PG, UK.""]",['eng'],"['R37 CA089441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 089441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101220,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Contamination', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostate/virology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*isolation & purification']",PMC3019155,2010/12/22 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/22 06:00'],"['2010/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-108 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-108 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Dec 20;7:108. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the generation of the first Af17 mutant mouse model and characterization of the Af17 temporal and spatial expression profile in various embryonic stages and adult tissues by X-gal staining, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. Af17 expression is detected in specific cell populations in all stages and in multiple tissues examined. In situ hybridization yielded a consistent Af17 expression pattern by X-gal staining. Homozygous mutant mice are viable, fertile, normal in size, and do not display any gross physical, behavioral, or hematopoietic abnormalities.

Moreover, when the single cell-derived clones were examined by clonal trafficking, no correlation between radio-resistant and chemo-resistant leukemic clones was detected, indicating that the resistance is developed by active acquisition of the resistance without clonal predisposition. Interestingly, the DTLs mimicked the characteristics of LSCs exhibiting leukemia-initiating activities and lower levels of reactive oxygen species or a higher level expression of bmi-1 as well as higher resistance to retinoic acid-induced differentiation compared to parental leukemic cells.

In this study, we showed that co-treatment with subtoxic doses of BBR and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis in human renal cancer cells, Caki cells, but not in normal tubular kidney cells. Treatment of Caki cells with BBR resulted in downregulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 proteins in a dose-dependent manner. The BBR-induced downregulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 proteins were involved in proteasome dependent pathways, which was confirmed by the result that pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibited berberine-induced downregulation of the c-FLIP and Mcl-1 proteins. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited the cell death induced by the combined treatment with BBR and TRAIL as well as recovered the expression levels of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 downregulated by treatment with BBR.

Celastrol induces apoptosis by means of proteasome inhibition and suppresses prostate tumor growth. However, the detailed mechanism of action remains elusive. In the current study, we aim to test the hypothesis that celastrol suppresses AIPC progression via inhibiting the constitutive NF-kappaB activity as well as modulating the Bcl-2 family proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the efficacy of celastrol both in vitro and in vivo, and evaluated the role of NF-kappaB in celastrol-mediated AIPC regression. We found that celastrol inhibited cell proliferation in all three AIPC cell lines (PC-3, DU145 and CL1), with IC(5)(0) in the range of 1-2 microM. Celastrol also suppressed cell migration and invasion. Celastrol significantly induced apoptosis as evidenced by increased sub-G1 population, caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Moreover, celastrol promoted cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and activated the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa. In addition, celastrol rapidly blocked cytosolic IkappaBalpha degradation and nuclear translocation of RelA. Likewise, celastrol inhibited the expression of multiple NF-kappaB target genes that are involved in proliferation, invasion and anti-apoptosis. Celastrol suppressed AIPC tumor progression by inhibiting proliferation, increasing apoptosis and decreasing angiogenesis, in PC-3 xenograft model in nude mouse. Furthermore, increased cellular IkappaBalpha and inhibited expression of various NF-kappaB target genes were observed in tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that, via targeting the proteasome, celastrol suppresses proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis by inducing the apoptotic machinery and attenuating constitutive NF-kappaB activity in AIPC both in vitro and in vivo. Celastrol as an active ingredient of traditional herbal medicine could thus be developed as a new therapeutic agent for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.",,"['Dai, Yao', 'Desano, Jeffrey', 'Tang, Wenhua', 'Meng, Xiaojie', 'Meng, Yang', 'Burstein, Ezra', 'Lawrence, Theodore S', 'Xu, Liang']","['Dai Y', 'Desano J', 'Tang W', 'Meng X', 'Meng Y', 'Burstein E', 'Lawrence TS', 'Xu L']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Division of Radiation and Cancer Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA121830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA128220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121830(S1)/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'L8GG98663L (celastrol)']",IM,"['Androgens/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/*pharmacology', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']",PMC3000808,2010/12/21 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2010/12/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0014153 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Dec 10;5(12):e14153. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0014153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Acute leukemia genomes commonly harbor submicroscopic gains and deletions of DNA which target key cellular pathways that influence leukemogenesis and the likelihood of treatment failure, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Notably, genetic alterations targeting transcriptional regulators of lymphoid development are a hallmark of B-progenitor ALL, and alteration of specific genes in this pathway, such as IKZF1 (encoding IKAROS), are associated with high-risk ALL. Integrated genomic profiling has identified potential therapeutic targets in ALL, including aberrant cytokine receptor signaling mediated by rearrangements and mutation of CRLF2 and JAK2. Genome-wide association studies are also providing important insights into the role of inherited genetic variation and susceptibility to ALL. In contrast, genomic profiling of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has thus far yielded fewer insights, but ongoing resequencing of leukemia genomes is uncovering novel mutations in both ALL and AML. SUMMARY: Genomic profiling has identified important new genetic lesions that contribute to leukemogenesis. These findings will have important implications for the development of new diagnostic tests and treatment approaches in high-risk leukemia. Future studies will be increasingly reliant on comprehensive genomic sequencing to reveal the spectrum of genetic alterations in this disease, with the ultimate aim of improving the treatment outcome for leukemia patients.",,"['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Roberts KG', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics']",,2010/12/21 06:00,2011/05/26 06:00,['2010/12/21 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283426260 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2011 Feb;23(1):34-40. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283426260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of AML and lymphomas, serum Nm23-H1 protein is elevated with the highest levels correlating with poorest prognosis. A recent study identified that this association is most likely causal in AML and that Nm23-H1 acts as an AML cell survival factor. In this study, we report heterogeneity in the ability of AML samples to bind and respond to Nm23-H1, and we offer evidence that binding is essential for improved survival. Further, we show that the subset of AMLs that bind Nm23-H1 do not do so through the putative Nm23-H1 receptor MUC1*. Although rNm23-H1 promoted the survival of the most primitive blasts within responding AMLs, it was not these cells that actually bound the protein. Instead, rNm23-H1 bound to more mature CD34(lo)/CD34(-) and CD11b(+) cells, revealing an indirect survival benefit of Nm23-H1 on primitive blasts. In support of this finding, the survival of purified blast cells was enhanced by medium conditioned by more mature cells from the clone that had been stimulated by rNm23-H1. Levels of interleukin 1beta (IL1beta) and IL6 in rNm23-H1 conditioned medium mirrored the potency of the conditioned media to promote blast cell survival. Furthermore, Nm23-H1 expression was significantly associated with IL1beta and IL6 expression in primary uncultured AML samples. These findings have implications for the role of Nm23-H1 in AML and its use as a prognostic marker. Additionally, they offer the first evidence of novel cross-talk between cell populations within the tumor clone.",,"['Lilly, Andrew J', 'Khanim, Farhat L', 'Hayden, Rachel E', 'Luong, Quang T', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Bunce, Christopher M']","['Lilly AJ', 'Khanim FL', 'Hayden RE', 'Luong QT', 'Drayson MT', 'Bunce CM']","['School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101217,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mucin-1/biosynthesis', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism']",,2010/12/21 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2010/12/21 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1704 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1704 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Feb 1;71(3):1177-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1704.

Here, we exploit the high degree of conservation in the tertiary structure of retroviral capsids to map the corresponding positions on the HIV1 capsid. We then demonstrated that, when changes were introduced at some of these positions, HIV1 becomes sensitive to huTRIM5alpha restriction, a phenomenon reinforced by additionally mutating the nearby cyclophilin A binding loop of the viral protein.

Yet, little is known about signal transduction pathways that mediate KRAS-induced phenotypes in human CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells. When cultured on bone marrow stroma, we observed that KRAS(G12V)-transduced cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells displayed a strong proliferative advantage over control cells, which coincided with increased early cobblestone (CAFC) formation and induction of myelomonocytic differentiation. However, the KRAS(G12V)-induced proliferative advantage was transient. By week three no progenitors remained in KRAS(G12V)-transduced cultures and cells were all terminally differentiated into monocytes/macrophages. In line with these results, LTC-IC frequencies were strongly reduced. Both the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, but not JNK, were activated by KRAS(G12V) and we observed that proliferation and CAFC formation were mediated via ERK, while differentiation was predominantly mediated via p38. Interestingly, we observed that KRAS(G12V)-induced proliferation and CAFC formation, but not differentiation, were largely mediated via secreted factors, since these phenotypes could be recapitulated by treating non-transduced cells with conditioned medium harvested from KRAS(G12V)-transduced cultures. Multiplex cytokine arrays and genome-wide gene expression profiling were performed to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which oncogenic KRAS(G12V) can contribute to the process of leukemic transformation. Thus, angiopoietin-like 6 (ANGPTL6) was identified as an important factor in the KRAS(G12V) secretome that enhanced proliferation of human CB CD34(+) cells.",,"['Fatrai, Szabolcs', 'van Gosliga, Djoke', 'Han, Lina', 'Daenen, Simon M G J', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Fatrai S', 'van Gosliga D', 'Han L', 'Daenen SM', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101217,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ANGPTL6 protein, human)', '0 (Angiopoietin-Like Protein 6)', '0 (Angiopoietin-like Proteins)', '0 (Angiopoietins)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Angiopoietin-Like Protein 6', 'Angiopoietin-like Proteins', 'Angiopoietins/genetics/metabolism', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3057777,2010/12/21 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2010/12/21 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51980-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.201848 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Feb 25;286(8):6061-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.201848.

A brief plasma half-life in part due to rapid deamination and chemotherapeutic-resistance frequently limit the utility of gemcitabine in clinical oncology. Selective 'targeted' delivery of gemcitabine represents a potential molecular strategy for simultaneously prolonging its plasma half-life and minimizing exposure of innocent tissues and organ systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gemcitabine was combined in molar excess with N-[p-maleimidophenyl]-isocyanate (PMPI) so that the isocyanate moiety of PMPI which exclusively reacts with hydroxyl groups preferentially created a carbamate covalent bond at the terminal C(5)-methylhydroxy group of gemcitabine. Monoclonal immunoglobulin with binding-avidity specifically for HER2/neu was thiolated with 2-iminothiolane at the terminal epsilon-amine group of lysine amino acid residues. The gemcitabine-(carbamate)-PMPI intermediate with a maleimide moiety that exclusively reacts with reduced sulfhydryl groups was then combined with thiolated anti-HER2/neu monoclonal immunoglobulin. Western-blot analysis was utilized to delineate the molecular weight profile for gemcitabine-(carbamate)-[anti-HER2/neu] while cell binding characteristics were determined by cell-ELISA utilizing SKBr-3 mammary carcinoma which highly over-expresses HER2/neu receptors. Cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency of gemcitabine-(carbamate)-[anti-HER2/neu] between the gemcitabine-equivalent concentrations of 10(-12) and 10(-6)M was determined utilizing vitality staining analysis of chemotherapeutic-resistant SKBr-3 mammary carcinoma. RESULTS: Gemcitabine-(carbamate)-[anti-HER2/neu] was synthesized at a molar incorporation index of 1:1.1 (110%) and had a molecular weight of 150kDa that was indistinguishable from reference control immunoglobulin fractions. Cell-ELISA detected progressive increases in SKBr-3 mammary carcinoma associated immunoglobulin with corresponding increases in covalent gemcitabine immunochemotherapeutic concentrations. The in vitro cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency of gemcitabine-(carbamate)-[anti-HER2/neu] was approximately 20% and 32% at 10(-7) and 10(-6)M (gemcitabine-equivalent concentrations) after a 182-h incubation period. DISCUSSION: The investigations describes for the first time a methodology for synthesizing a gemcitabine anti-HER2/neu immunochemotherapeutic by creating a covalent bond structure between the C(5)-methylhydroxy group of gemcitabine and thiolated lysine amino acid residues of monoclonal antibody or other biologically active protein fractions. Gemcitabine-(carbamate)-[anti-HER2/neu] possessed binding-avidity at HER2/neu receptors highly over-expressed by chemotherapeutic-resistant SKBr-3 mammary carcinoma. Alternatively, gemcitabine can be covalently linked at its C(5)-methylhydroxy group to monoclonal immunoglobulin fractions that possess binding-avidity for other receptors and membrane complexes uniquely highly over-expressed by a variety of neoplastic cell types. Compared to chemotherapeutic-resistant SKBr-3 mammary carcinoma, gemcitabine-(carbamate)-[anti-HER2/neu] immunochemotherapeutic is anticipated to exert higher levels of cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency against other neoplastic cell types like pancreatic carcinoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, cervical epithelioid carcinoma, or leukemia/lymphoid neoplastic cell types based on their reportedly greater sensitivity to gemcitabine and gemcitabine covalent conjugates.",['Copyright A(c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We used two lineages of hematologic tumors: NB4, derived from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and Granta-519 from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We also tested cells from 12 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and from 10 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). HRP targeting was performed with anti-CD33 or anti-CD19 antibodies (depending on the origin of the cell), followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with HRP. Eight experimental groups were analyzed: control, HRP targeted, HRP targeted and incubated with 1, 5 and 10mM IAA, and cells not HRP targeted but incubated with 1, 5 and 10mM IAA. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide labeling.

In this study, we introduced sgc8c aptamer (this aptamer targets leukemia biomarker protein tyrosine kinase-7) to complex between Dau (daunorubicin) and SWNT to enhance targeted delivery of Dau to acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-cells (Molt-4). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dau-aptamer-SWNTs tertiary complex formation was analyzed by visible spectroscopy and spectrofluorophotometric analysis. Dau release profiles from the complex were investigated in pH 7.4 and 5.5. For cytotoxic studies (MTT assay), Molt-4 (target) and U266 (B lymphocyte human myeloma, non-target) cells were treated with Dau, Dau-aptamer-SWNTs tertiary complex. Internalization was analyzed by flow cytometry. Targeted delivery of Dau was antagonized using antisense of aptamer. RESULTS: Dau was efficiently loaded onto SWNTs (efficiency approximately 157%). Dau was released from Dau-aptamer-SWNTs tertiary complex in a pH-dependent manner (higher release rate at pH 5.5). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the tertiary complex was internalized effectively to Molt-4 cells, but not to U266 cells. Cytotoxicity of Dau-aptamer-SWNTs tertiary complex also confirmed internalization data. Dau-aptamer-SWNTs tertiary complex was less cytotoxic in U266 cells when compared to Dau alone. No significant change in viability between Dau- and complex-treated Molt-4 cells was observed. Cytotoxicity of Dau-aptamer-SWNTs complex was efficiently and quickly reversed using antisense in Molt-4 cells. CONCLUSION: Dau-aptamer-SWNTs complex is able to selectively target Molt-4 cells. The other advantages of this system are reversibility and pH-dependent release of Dau from its complex.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One of their most important mechanisms of action is the activation of p53, leading to apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. Classically, the activation of p53 also induces p21 accumulation, which leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. In previous work, we observed that 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA), a NA with high activity in lymphoid disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), promotes the G1/S transition in the CLL cell line EHEB at cytotoxic concentrations. This finding led us to investigate the p21 response to NAs in these cells. We show here that CdA, but also fludarabine, gemcitabine, and cytarabine, strongly reduced the p21 protein level in EHEB cells as well as in JVM-2 cells, another CLL cell line. This p21 depletion occurred despite induction of p53 and increase of p21 mRNA and was prevented by proteasome inhibitors. Increase of proteasomal degradation caused by NAs appeared to be ubiquitin-independent. Also, NAs induced in these cells an increase of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2) activity and a monoubiquitination of cell proliferating nuclear antigen (PCNA), two processes that are negatively regulated by p21. These changes were not observed with other p53 activators, like etoposide and nutlin-3a that increased the p21 protein level. In conclusion, our study reveals that NAs can induce an alternative pattern of cellular response in some cell models.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective chart review was conducted. Between 2003 and 2007, 54 patients with NHL were treated to 85 anatomical sites with a 2x2 Gy palliative regimen. Local response was assessed by clinical and/or radiographic data. Symptoms before and after treatment for each site treated were obtained from clinical notes in patient medical records. Median follow-up time was 1.3 years. RESULTS: For the 54 patients, the median age at time of treatment was 71.1 years old, and 57% of them were male. Of the 85 disease sites treated, 56% of sites had indolent histology, 28% of sites were diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 13% of sites had aggressive histology, and 2% of sites were shown to have other histology. Overall response rate (ORR) was 81% (49% complete response [CR], 32% partial response [PR]). The 2-year rate for freedom from local progression was 50% (95% CI, 37%-61%). The ORR for follicular lymphoma, Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) histology was 88%, compared with a 59% rate for CLL histology (p=0.005). While the ORR was similar for tumors of different sizes, the CR rate for patients with tumors<5 cm tended to be higher than those with tumors>10 cm (CR rate of 57% vs. 27%, respectively; p=0.06). For the 48 sites with clearly documented symptoms at pretreatment, 92% of sites improved after low-dose RT. CONCLUSIONS: Short-course low-dose palliative radiotherapy (2x2 Gy) is an effective treatment that results in high response rates for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This treatment regimen provides effective symptomatic relief for tumor bulk of all sizes.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

XPB and XPD are part of the TFIIH complex which mediates basal transcription and DNA nucleotide excision repair. Retroviral infection increases when XPB or XPD are mutant.

Other host factors implicated in the stability of cDNA are not components of the XPB and XPD degradation pathway. Although an increase of retroviral cDNA in XPB or XPD mutant cells correlates with an increase of integrated provirus, the integration efficiency of pre-integration complexes is unaffected.

Although mechanistic detail of the IN-catalyzed integration reaction is well defined, numerous evidence have demonstrated that IN is involved in multiple steps of retrovirus replication other than integration. In this study, Huwe1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, was identified as a new cellular interactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN. The interaction was mediated through the catalytic core domain of IN and a wide-range region of Huwe1. Interestingly, although depletion of Huwe1 in target cells did not affect the early phase of HIV-1 infection in a human T cell line, we found that infectivity of HIV-1 released from the Huwe1 knockdown cells was significantly augmented more than that of virus produced from control cells. The increase in infectivity occurred in proviral DNA synthesis. Further analysis revealed that Huwe1 interacted with HIV-1 Gag-Pol precursor protein through an IN domain.

In this study, we examined whether combined treatment with PIC and TRAIL synergistically induces apoptosis in THP-1 leukemia cells. Results indicate that PIC substantially enhances TRAIL-induced cell death including DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Consistent with TRAIL-induced apoptosis, PIC significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL. Further, PIC enhanced DR5 promoter activity via Sp1 activation. Interestingly, the DR5 chimera antibodies significantly suppressed PIC and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. The inhibitor of ERK also decreased PIC and TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking DR5 expression. In conclusion, our results suggest that PIC sensitizes TRAIL-induced-apoptosis via Sp1- and ERK-dependent DR5 up-regulation.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, quiescent CML cells are insensitive to TKI and can lead to relapse of the disease. Thus, research is needed to elucidate the properties of these quiescent CML cells, including their microenvironment, in order to effectively target them. Hypoxia is known to be a common feature of solid tumors that contributes to therapeutic resistance. Leukemic cells are also able to survive and proliferate in severely hypoxic environments. The hypoxic conditions in the bone marrow (BM) allow leukemic cells that reside there to become insensitive to cell death stimuli. To target leukemic cells in hypoxic conditions, we focused on the hypoxia-selective cytotoxin, Rakicidin A. A previous report showed that Rakicidin A, a natural product produced by the Micromonospora strain, induced hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity in solid tumors. Here, we describe Rakicidin A-induced cell death in hypoxia-adapted (HA)-CML cells with stem cell-like characteristics. Interestingly, apoptosis was induced via caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. In addition, treatment with Rakicidin A in combination with the TKI, imatinib, resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity against HA-CML cells. In conclusion, Rakicidin A is a promising compound for targeting TKI-resistant quiescent CML stem cells in the hypoxic BM environment.",['(c) 2010 Japanese Cancer Association.'],"['Takeuchi, Miki', 'Ashihara, Eishi', 'Yamazaki, Yohko', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Nakagawa, Yoko', 'Tanaka, Ruriko', 'Yao, Hisayuki', 'Nagao, Rina', 'Hayashi, Yoshihiro', 'Hirai, Hideyo', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Takeuchi M', 'Ashihara E', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Kimura S', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Tanaka R', 'Yao H', 'Nagao R', 'Hayashi Y', 'Hirai H', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101219,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (rakicidin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,2010/12/21 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/21 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01813.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Mar;102(3):591-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01813.x.

The in vitro proliferation and expansion of these cells is necessary for their use in stem cell therapy. Recently our group has developed and characterized mesenchymal stem cells from subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. We observed that these cells show a slower growth rate at higher passages and therefore decided to develop a supplemented medium, which will induce proliferation. Choi et al. have recently shown that the use of ascorbic acid enhances the proliferation of bone marrow derived MSCs. We therefore studied the effect of ascorbic acid on the proliferation of MSCs and characterized their phenotypes using stem cell specific molecular markers. It was observed that the use of 250 muM ascorbic acid promoted the significant growth of MSCs without loss of phenotype and differentiation potential. There was no considerable change in gene expression of cell surface markers CD105, CD13, Nanog, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Keratin 18. Moreover, the MSCs maintained in the medium supplemented with ascorbic acid for a period of 4 weeks showed increase in pluripotency markers Oct4 and SOX 2. Also cells in the experimental group retained the typical spindle shaped morphology.

However, its unfavorable pharmacologic properties, severe side effects and the negative role of IL-2 in maintaining T regulatory cells are severe drawbacks. It has been shown that immunocomplexes of IL-2 and certain anti-IL-2 mAbs possess selective and high stimulatory activity in vivo. Here, we show that IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes expand not only CD122(high) subsets and newly activated CD8(+) T cells but also natural killer T cells and gammadelta T cells. Further, we demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells expanded by IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes in vivo have high cytolytic activity, which can be further increased by coadministration of IL-12. We also demonstrate that IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes possess noticeable antitumor activity in two syngeneic mouse tumor models, namely BCL1 leukemia and B16F10 melanoma, but only if administered early in tumor progression. To effectively treat established tumors, we administered the tumor-bearing mice first with N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer-bound doxorubicin conjugate, and subsequently with IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes alone or with IL-12 to induce an efficient antitumor immune response. Importantly, we show that the conjugate has significantly lower immunosuppressive activity than free doxorubicin when using dosage with comparable antitumor activity, thus eliminating the majority of tumor cells while leaving the immune system mostly unimpaired for stimulation with IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes. Indeed, we demonstrate that the conjugate and IL-2/S4B6 mAb immunocomplexes together have synergistic antitumor activity.",['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],"['Tomala, Jakub', 'Chmelova, Helena', 'Strohalm, Jiri', 'Ulbrich, Karel', 'Sirova, Milada', 'Rihova, Blanka', 'Kovar, Marek']","['Tomala J', 'Chmelova H', 'Strohalm J', 'Ulbrich K', 'Sirova M', 'Rihova B', 'Kovar M']","['Department of Immunology and Gnotobiology, Institute of Microbiology ASCR, v.v.i., Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110413,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '171714-74-2 (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide co-polymer-doxorubicin conjugate)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-12/administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,2010/12/18 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2010/12/18 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25859 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Oct 15;129(8):2002-12. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25859.

In this study, we analyzed WNT5A expression in various kinds of leukaemia cases, leukaemia CR cases, non-malignant hematopoietic (NMH) cases, as well as in leukemic cell lines and CD34+ cells. The methylation status of the WNT5A promoter and the levels of the Wnt5a protein were also studied. We also investigated the effect of Wnt5a on leukemic cell proliferation. WNT5A expression level was higher in NMH but lower in leukaemia cases compared to that in CR-cases (P<0.01), and was expressed at low level in leukemic cell lines K562, U937 and Jurkat. Wnt5a protein was positive in NMH, CR cases and CD34+, but negative in leukaemia cases. WNT5A promoter was methylated in leukaemia cases and all leukemic cell lines, but not in NMH and CR cases. WNT5A expression was up-regulated after exposure to the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) in the K562, U937, Jurkat leukemic cell lines and in 83.3% (10/12) of CR patients after cure, respectively. The increased Wnt5a protein can inhibit K562 malignant proliferation and arrest cell cycle at the G2/M phase after exposure to Aza. These results indicate that WNT5A expression was restored in complete remission cases due to demethylation, and Wnt5a can inhibit leukaemic cell proliferation. We propose that WNT5A can act as a suppressor factor in leukemogenesis and can be used as a potential marker for curative effect assessment in leukaemia.",,"['Deng, Gang', 'Li, Zhao Quan', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Niu, Chang Chun', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Pan, Jing', 'Si, Wei Ke']","['Deng G', 'Li ZQ', 'Zhao C', 'Yuan Y', 'Niu CC', 'Zhao C', 'Pan J', 'Si WK']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101214,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Wnt-5a Protein', 'Young Adult']",,2010/12/18 06:00,2011/05/10 06:00,['2010/12/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2010.1108 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2011 Feb;25(2):367-76. doi: 10.3892/or.2010.1108.

Apoptosis is thought to be an important response to most chemotherapeutic agents in leukemia cells. However, the underlying mechanism of induction of apoptosis by quercetin involving epigenetic regulation is poorly understood. In the present study, by evaluation of fragmentation of DNA, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and procaspases, we found that quercetin was able to induce apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Quercetin triggered the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through activation of caspase-8 and induction of Bid cleavage, Bax conformation change and cytochrome c release. Furthermore, quercetin induced Fas ligand (FasL) expression involving activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun N-terminus kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. In addition to activation of c-Jun, quercetin increased histone H3 acetylation which resulted in the promotion of the expression of FasL. Quercetin exhibited potential for the activation of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and the inhibition of histone deacetyltransferase (HADC), both of which contributed to histone acetylation. However, only the activation effect on HAT was associated with the ERK and JNK pathway. These results demonstrated that quercetin induced FasL-related apoptosis by transactivation through activation of c-jun/AP-1 and promotion of histone H3 acetylation in HL-60 cells.",,"['Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Chen, Yun-Ru', 'Tseng, Tsui-Hwa']","['Lee WJ', 'Chen YR', 'Tseng TH']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, School of Applied Chemistry, Chung Shan Medical University, and Department of Pathology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101210,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,2010/12/18 06:00,2011/05/10 06:00,['2010/12/18 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2010.1097 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2011 Feb;25(2):583-91. doi: 10.3892/or.2010.1097.

Immunotherapy is a promising strategy for eradicating minimal residual disease and thus preventing the relapse of leukemia. Apart from stem cell transplantation, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are excellent candidates for the immunotherapy of leukemia. However, the number of usable CpG ODNs is limited. In this study, we tested a panel of CpG ODNs and obtained three CpG ODN sequences with strong immunostimulatory activity by comparing their capacity to activate lymphocytes. The data revealed that the flanking bases, the spacing of individual CpG motifs and polyguanosine ends, contribute to the immunostimulatory activity of a CpG ODN. In the immunotherapy of murine leukemia with the novel ODN as the adjuvant, we found that CpG Seqs 14 and 19 were effective in the treatment of a leukemia model by prolonging survival span, augmenting natural killer cell and CTL cytotoxicity, as well as increasing the number of long-term survivors. The ability of CpG ODN to induce both strong innate and adaptive anti-leukemic immune activity could render it an appropriate agent for therapeutic applications in acute leukemia.

We investigated the effects of a novel small-molecule JAK inhibitor (AZD1480) on IL-6/JAK signal transduction and its biological consequences on the human myeloma-derived cell lines U266 and Kms.11. At low micromolar concentrations, AZD1480 blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of myeloma cell lines. These biological responses to AZD1480 are associated with concomitant inhibition of phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3 and MAPK signaling proteins. In addition, there is inhibition of expression of STAT3 target genes, particularly Cyclin D2. Examination of a wider variety of myeloma cells (RPMI 8226, OPM-2, NCI-H929, Kms.18, MM1.S and IM-9), as well as primary myeloma cells, showed that AZD1480 has broad efficacy. In contrast, viability of normal peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells and CD138(+) cells derived from healthy controls was not significantly inhibited. Importantly, AZD1480 induces cell death of Kms.11 cells grown in the presence of HS-5 bone marrow (BM)-derived stromal cells and inhibits tumor growth in a Kms.11 xenograft mouse model, accompanied with inhibition of phospho-FGFR3, phospho-JAK2, phospho-STAT3 and Cyclin D2 levels.

These cytokines share gp130 as a common signal transducer in their receptor complex and typically activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. Studies have shown that several gp130 cytokines have differential effects on both adipogenesis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Yet, the complex interactions of these cytokines in adipose tissue have not been studied. Gp130 cytokines are differentially regulated in multiple tissues due to the presence of additional receptor components that are required for signaling, including the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Previous studies from our laboratory highlighted the ability of specific gp130 cytokines to crosstalk in adipocytes that correlated with LIFR degradation. Crosstalk is defined as the ability of one cytokine to modulate the signaling of another cytokine. Our novel studies reveal that white adipose tissue is highly responsive to gp130 cytokines, and we provide the first evidence that these cytokines can exert inhibitory crosstalk in adipose tissue in vivo. Moreover, several gp130 cytokines that use the LIFR, including cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), LIF, and human oncostatin M (hOSM), can alter the subsequent signaling of other family members in adipocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Our data also show that murine OSM and neuropoietin do not crosstalk in the same manner as other gp130 cytokines, which likely results from their inability to activate the LIFR. Overall, we have observed distinctive patterns of crosstalk signaling by gp130 cytokines in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate the crosstalk is not dependent on new protein synthesis or extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activation.",,"['White, Ursula A', 'Stewart, William C', 'Stephens, Jacqueline M']","['White UA', 'Stewart WC', 'Stephens JM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK072476/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052968/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052968-12/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK52968/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101216,United States,Obesity (Silver Spring),"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",101264860,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', '*Receptor Cross-Talk/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/physiology']",PMC3080457,2010/12/18 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2010/12/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['oby2010293 [pii]', '10.1038/oby.2010.293 [doi]']",ppublish,Obesity (Silver Spring). 2011 May;19(5):903-10. doi: 10.1038/oby.2010.293.

A major obstacle to elucidate the contribution of age to the development and evolution of leukaemias is the lack of appropriate mouse models where precise control of the timing of oncogene expression is possible. Here we present proof-of-principle experiments showing how a conditional transgenic mouse model of BCR-ABLp190-driven B-ALL offers the opportunity to test the hypothesis that the age of the leukemic cells-of-origin of B-ALL influences B-ALL malignancy.

During metaphase, the dynein-dynactin complex removes spindle checkpoint proteins from kinetochores to facilitate the transition to anaphase. Three components (p150(Glued), dynamitin, and p24) compose a key portion of the dynactin complex, termed the projecting arm. To investigate the roles of the dynactin complex in mitosis, we used RNA interference to down-regulate p24 and p150(Glued) in human cells. In response to p24 down-regulation, we observed cells with delayed metaphase in which chromosomes frequently align abnormally to resemble a ""figure eight,"" resulting in cell death. We attribute the figure eight chromosome alignment to impaired metaphasic centrosomes that lack spindle tension. Like p24, RNA interference of p150(Glued) also induces prometaphase and metaphase delays; however, most of these cells eventually enter anaphase and complete mitosis. Our findings suggest that although both p24 and p150(Glued) components of the dynactin complex contribute to mitotic progression, p24 also appears to play a role in metaphase centrosome integrity, helping to ensure the transition to anaphase.",,"['Ozaki, Yuko', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Asou, Hiroya', 'Aki, Daisuke', 'Inaba, Toshiya']","['Ozaki Y', 'Matsui H', 'Nagamachi A', 'Asou H', 'Aki D', 'Inaba T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101216,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DCTN1 protein, human)', '0 (DCTN2 protein, human)', '0 (Dynactin Complex)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)']",IM,"['Anaphase/*physiology', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Chromosomal Instability/physiology', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dynactin Complex', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Metaphase/*physiology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference']",PMC3037672,2010/12/18 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)52129-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.167742 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Feb 18;286(7):5589-98. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.167742.

We generated Mx1-Cre, Lox-STOP-Lox (LSL)-Nras(G12D) mice to comprehensively analyze the phenotypic, cellular, and biochemical consequences of endogenous oncogenic Nras expression in hematopoietic cells.

Expressing mutant Nras in hematopoietic tissues alters the distribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations, and Nras mutant progenitors show distinct responses to cytokine growth factors. Injecting Mx1-Cre, LSL-Nras(G12D) mice with the MOL4070LTR retrovirus causes acute myeloid leukemia that faithfully recapitulates many aspects of human NRAS-associated leukemias, including cooperation with deregulated Evi1 expression. The disease phenotype in Mx1-Cre, LSL-Nras(G12D) mice is attenuated compared with Mx1-Cre, LSL-Kras(G12D) mice, which die of aggressive myeloproliferative disorder by 4 months of age. We found that endogenous Kras(G12D) expression results in markedly elevated Ras protein expression and Ras-GTP levels in Mac1(+) cells, whereas Mx1-Cre, LSL-Nras(G12D) mice show much lower Ras protein and Ras-GTP levels.

This outcome may be the result of an altered expression pattern or activity of drug transporters.

In vitro experiments show a significant role of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in cellular uptake and retention of imatinib, although pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic data are still scarce and contradictory. ABCB1 and ABCC1 expression was shown in GIST, whereas ABCB1, ABCG2, and OCT1 were found in mononuclear cells in CML patients. Several studies have reported a clinical relevance of tumor expression or activity of OCT1 in CML patients.

Recent efforts have been directed at the development of non-animal based tests such as in vitro cell activation assays for the identification of skin sensitizers. Prohapten identification by in vitro assays is still problematic due to the lack of prohapten bioactivation. The present study evaluated the effect of hapten and prohapten exposure on cell surface markers expression (CD86, CD54 and CD40) in the human monocytic leukemia, THP-1, cell line. Upregulation of activation and costimulatory markers are key events in the allergic sensitization process and have been reported to serve as indicators of skin sensitization. Cells were exposed to the prohaptens benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), carvone oxime (COx), cinnamic alcohol (CA) and isoeugenol (IEG) at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 muM for 24 and 48 h. The direct-binding haptens dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), benzoquinone (BQ), hydroxylethyl acrylate (HEA) and benzylbromide (BB) were used as positive controls. Cells were also exposed to the irritants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sulfanilamide (SFA). Bioactivation of prohaptens was achieved by adding aroclor-induced rat liver microsomes (S9) to the cell cultures. Consistent upregulation of surface expressions of CD86, CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD40 was observed in THP-1 cells treated with direct-acting haptens (+/-S9) or prohapten (+S9). Upregulation of these markers was not observed after exposure to skin irritants or prohaptens in the absence of exogenously added S9. In conclusion, modification of in vitro cell culture assays to include co-incubation with microsomes enhances identification of prohaptens and allows them to be clearly distinguished from direct-binding haptens.",['Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.'],"['Chipinda, Itai', 'Ruwona, Tinashe B', 'Templeton, Steven P', 'Siegel, Paul D']","['Chipinda I', 'Ruwona TB', 'Templeton SP', 'Siegel PD']","['Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505-2888, USA.

Among these, neurological disorders stand out, as they appear in 10-30% of patients with systemic neoplasia. Neoplastic meningitis accounts for 4-15% of patients with solid tumours and it has a poor prognosis. The objective of this paper is to describe the clinical, imaging and prognostic characteristics as well as cerebrospinal fluid findings in a series of neoplastic meningitis. BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT: We performed a retrospective review of all patients admitted to the Hospital Universitario of Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin with clinical suspicion of neoplastic meningitis between 1990 and 2008. We selected 37 patients with an average age ranging from 15 to 75 years old. A total of 81.8% of the cases in which a primary tumour was found were associated with solid tumours (24.2% were located in the breast, and 24.2% in the lung). The most frequent sign of cranial nerve dysfunction was dyplopia, which was observed in 32.4% of the cases. The average survival rate after diagnosis was 87.9 days (12.6 weeks). The cerebrospinal fluid cytology was positive in 46.4% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Neoplastic meningitis is a severe complication of both solid and haematological tumours. We stress the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion to achieve early diagnosis, since the average survival probability for neoplastic meningitis patients is low.","['Copyright (c) 2009 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia.

METHODS: Twenty patients, 13 males and 7 females, who developed III-IV intestinal acute GVHD after haplotypic HSCT between October 2004 and September 2009, were treated with basiliximab (20 mg/d, d1, 4) and prednisolone (1 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1)) from the day of diagnosis. The therapy was repeated in the second week if the intestinal symptoms showed no improvement. The therapeutic effect was analyzed and the adverse reaction and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection were observed. RESULTS: Ten patients had a complete remission and 5 were in a partial remission. The total effective rate was 75.0%. The clinical symptoms started to lessen in 1-12 days after using basiliximab (average: 7 days).

METHODS: General population over age of 15 from a community in Qidong was screened for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and alanine transaminase (ALT) in 1976, and followed-up thenceforth. From January 1, 1977 through December 31, 2007, 12 351 people were enrolled in the cohort, and their occurrence, outcome of PLC and other cancers, together with all the withdrawals due to death were linked to and checked with database from Qidong Cancer Registry and Qidong Vital Registry programs. RESULTS: The total observed person-years (PYs) were 355 305.0. One hundred and seventy-three PLC cases were identified among the HBsAg carriers, with an incidence of 361.55 per 100 000 PYs, while PLC cases were only 95 for the non-carriers, with an incidence of 30.90 per 100 000 PYs. The overall relative risk (RR) was 11.70 (95%CI: 9.06 - 15.19), with RR 12.30 for men and 10.46 for women. HBsAg carriers had high incidence at each age group, compared with the non-carriers for both men and women. Data from cross-over analysis showed that the incidence rates of PLC for the sub-cohorts of female non-carriers, male non-carriers, female carriers, and male carriers were 1.00, 3.07, 10.46, and 37.76, respectively. The cumulative rates of PLC in the 4 groups were 0.86%, 2.73%, 10.22%, and 34.19%, respectively. Results from non-conditional logistic regression model showed that the gender (male), age, HBsAg(+), and ALT(+) were risk factors for the development of PLC while anti-HBs(+) demonstrated a protective effect. No relationship was found among carriers and non-carriers for cancer sites such as lung, stomach, esophagus, intestine, pancreas, breast, cervix, bladder, and lymphoma, brain tumor, or leukemia. CONCLUSION: Causation and its strength, together with specificity and persistency of the association were confirmed from this HBsAg-related cohort study in the general population in Qidong.

However, the biological function of long ncRNAs in mammalian cells remains largely unknown. Our recent expression profiling of selected human long ncRNAs revealed that a majority were expressed in an organ-specific manner, suggesting their function was linked to specific physiological phenomena in each organ. We investigated the characteristics and function of ncRNAs that were specifically expressed in the thymus, the site of T-cell selection and maturation. RESULTS: Expression profiling of 10 thymus-specific ncRNAs in 17 T-cell leukemia cell lines derived from various stages of T-cell maturation revealed that HIT14168 ncRNA, named Thy-ncR1, was specifically expressed in cell lines derived from stage III immature T cells in which the neighbouring CD1 gene cluster is also specifically activated. The Thy-ncR1 precursor exhibited complex alternative splicing patterns and differential usage of the 5' terminus leading to the production of an estimated 24 isoforms, which were predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Selective RNAi knockdown of each Thy-ncR1 isoform demonstrated that microfibril-associated glycoprotein 4 (MFAP4) mRNA was negatively regulated by two major Thy-ncR1 isoforms. Intriguingly, the MFAP4 mRNA level was controlled by a hUPF1-dependent mRNA degradation pathway in the cytoplasm distinct from nonsense-mediated decay. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified Thy-ncR1 ncRNA to be specifically expressed in stage III immature T cells in which the neighbouring CD1 gene cluster was activated.

It has been demonstrated by the alignment comparison with data base available that it is a novel member of Ubc family and got the number from GeneBank: UBF-F1 AF 294842. AIM AND METHODS: To demonstrate its authenticity, UBF was amplified from the total RNA of human fetal liver and HL-60 cell line using RT-PCR, and the PCR products were further sequenced and compared with the original UBF sequence. To evaluate the expression level and subcellular location of UBF in human multiple tissues, in situ hybridization was carried out on the frozen section of human fetal multiple tissues and HL-60 cell line with DIG-labeled UBF cDNA probes. RESULTS: The experimental results of RT-PCR and sequencing showed that the sequence of RT-PCR products were the same as the original UBF. The experimental results of in situ hybridization showed that UBF was expressed widely by human multiple fetal tissues and the expression level were very high in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the special structure of UBF is authentic, and the expression profiling research of UBF shows that UBF is expressed widely by human multiple fetal tissues and the expression level is very high in HL-60 cells, implying that UBF plays the important function in the developing tissues and leukemia cells. It is also suggested that UBF may be functionally related with the nucleic-involving cellular activities based on the results of sub-cellular localizations.",,"['Cui, Chun-Ping', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Yu, Yong-Tao', 'Li, Yu-Zhen', 'Geng, Yu', 'Zhao, Shi-Fu']","['Cui CP', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu YT', 'Li YZ', 'Geng Y', 'Zhao SF']","['Department of Genomics and Proteomics, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Ying Yong Sheng Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo ying yong sheng li xue za zhi = Zhongguo yingyong shenglixue zazhi = Chinese journal of applied physiology,9426407,"['0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (transcription factor UBF)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Reading Frames', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*classification', 'Ubiquitination']",,2004/02/01 00:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2010/12/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Ying Yong Sheng Li Xue Za Zhi. 2004 Feb;20(1):66-9.,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF294842'],,,,,,

Here we have examined this issue in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in which the ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion is an early or initiating genetic lesion followed by a modest number of recurrent or 'driver' copy number alterations. By multiplexing fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential order.

Although inhibition of Akt-mediated cell survival may provide a means to eliminate cancer cells, this survival pathway remains incompletely understood. In particular, unlike anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that prevent apoptosis independent of glucose, Akt requires glucose metabolism to inhibit cell death. This glucose dependence may occur in part through metabolic regulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Here, we show that activated Akt relies on glycolysis to inhibit induction of Puma, which was uniquely sensitive to metabolic status among pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and was rapidly up-regulated in glucose-deficient conditions. Importantly, preventing Puma expression was critical for Akt-mediated cell survival, as Puma deficiency protected cells from glucose deprivation and Akt could not readily block Puma-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim was induced normally even when constitutively active Akt was expressed, yet Akt could provide protection from Bim cytotoxicity. Up-regulation of Puma appeared mediated by decreased availability of mitochondrial metabolites rather than glycolysis itself, as alternative mitochondrial fuels could suppress Puma induction and apoptosis upon glucose deprivation. Metabolic regulation of Puma was mediated through combined p53-dependent transcriptional induction and control of Puma protein stability, with Puma degraded in nutrient-replete conditions and long lived in nutrient deficiency. Together, these data identify a key role for Bcl-2 family proteins in Akt-mediated cell survival that may be critical in normal immunity and in cancer through Akt-dependent stimulation of glycolysis to suppress Puma expression.",,"['Coloff, Jonathan L', 'Mason, Emily F', 'Altman, Brian J', 'Gerriets, Valerie A', 'Liu, Tingyu', 'Nichols, Amanda N', 'Zhao, Yuxing', 'Wofford, Jessica A', 'Jacobs, Sarah R', 'Ilkayeva, Olga', 'Garrison, Sean P', 'Zambetti, Gerard P', 'Rathmell, Jeffrey C']","['Coloff JL', 'Mason EF', 'Altman BJ', 'Gerriets VA', 'Liu T', 'Nichols AN', 'Zhao Y', 'Wofford JA', 'Jacobs SR', 'Ilkayeva O', 'Garrison SP', 'Zambetti GP', 'Rathmell JC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01AI063345/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM083159/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI063345/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F30HL094044/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123350-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA123350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 HL094044/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM083159/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101215,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucose/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycolysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC3037705,2010/12/17 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/17 06:00'],"['2010/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)52162-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.179101 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Feb 18;286(7):5921-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.179101.

Dot1, the only known histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, has been shown to interact with multiple MLL fusion partners including AF9, ENL, AF10, and AF17. In this study, we utilize a conditional Dot1l deletion model to investigate the role of Dot1 in hematopoietic progenitor cell immortalization by MLL fusion proteins. Western blot and mass spectrometry show that Dot1-deficient cells are depleted of the global H3K79 methylation mark. We find that loss of Dot1 activity attenuates cell viability and colony formation potential of cells immortalized by MLL oncoproteins but not by the leukemic oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1. Although this effect is most pronounced for MLL-AF9, we find that Dot1 contributes to the viability of cells immortalized by other MLL oncoproteins that are not known to directly recruit Dot1. Cells immortalized by MLL fusions also show increased apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of Dot1 in survival pathways.

One explanation is that p53 is targeted for degradation by the E3 ligase MDM2. However, we found in this study that blockade of the interaction of p53 and MDM2 by the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3 in melanoma cells did not induce apoptosis, even though it upregulated p53 and its proapoptotic targets. Nevertheless, nutlin-3 enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis as a result of p53-mediated upregulation of TRAIL-R2. Unexpectedly, nutlin-3 upregulated Mcl-1, which attenuated apoptotic signaling triggered by TRAIL, and inhibited apoptosis induced by the microtubule-targeting drug docetaxel. The increase in Mcl-1 was related to a p53-independent transcriptional mechanism, but stabilization of the Mcl-1 protein played a dominant role, as nutlin-3 upregulated the Mcl-1 protein to a much greater extent than the Mcl-1 mRNA, and this was associated with prolonged half-life time and reduced ubiquitination of the protein. Knockdown of p53 blocked the upregulation of the Mcl-1 protein, indicating that p53 plays a critical role in the stabilization of Mcl-1. The contrasting effects of nutlin-3 on TRAIL- and docetaxel-induced apoptosis were confirmed in fresh melanoma isolates. Collectively, these results show that nutlin-3 may be a useful agent in combination with TRAIL and, importantly, uncover a novel regulatory effect of p53 on the expression of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells on treatment with nutlin-3, which may antagonize the therapeutic efficacy of other chemotherapeutic drugs in addition to docetaxel in melanoma.",['(c)2010 AACR.'],"['Tseng, Hsin-Yi', 'Jiang, Chen Chen', 'Croft, Amanda', 'Tay, Kwang Hong', 'Thorne, Rick Francis', 'Yang, Fan', 'Liu, Hao', 'Hersey, Peter', 'Zhang, Xu Dong']","['Tseng HY', 'Jiang CC', 'Croft A', 'Tay KH', 'Thorne RF', 'Yang F', 'Liu H', 'Hersey P', 'Zhang XD']","['Immunology and Oncology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Docetaxel', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Melanoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Taxoids/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/12/17 06:00,2011/03/29 06:00,['2010/12/17 06:00'],"['2010/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['9/12/3363 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0646 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Dec;9(12):3363-74. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, however, unclear whether targeting STAT3 will be an effective antileukemia therapy. In this study, we assessed in vitro antileukemia activity of the STAT3 inhibitor JSI-124 (cucurbitacin I). JSI-124 potently induces apoptosis in 3 B-leukemia cell lines (BJAB, I-83, and NALM-6) and in primary CLL cells and was associated with a reduction in serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT3. Similarly, knockdown of STAT3 expression induced apoptosis in these leukemia cells. In addition, we found that JSI-124 and knockdown of STAT3 decreased antiapoptotic protein XIAP expression and overexpression of XIAP blocked JSI-124-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that combined treatment of JSI-124 and TRAIL increased apoptosis associated with an increase in death receptor 4 expression. Besides apoptosis, we found that JSI-124 also induced cell-cycle arrest prior to apoptosis in B-leukemia cells. This corresponded with reduced expression of the cell-cycle regulatory gene, cdc-2.

Many patients are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Therapy, with immunosuppressant agents such as low dose methotrexate or ciclosporin, is usually indicated to correct cytopenias. In contrast, aggressive NK-cell leukaemia and the rare CD56(+) aggressive T-LGL leukaemia follow a fulminant clinical course, affect younger individuals and require more intensive combination chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant in eligible patients.

Indeed, this kinase is a proto-oncogene that has been implicated in early transformation and tumor progression, especially in hematopoietic malignancies and prostate carcinoma where it is a marker of a poor prognosis. For these reasons, Pim1 is emerging as an important target in drug discovery, and many Pim1 inhibitors have been reported in the last three years. The challenge of this research is to obtain compounds that specifically inhibit only Pim1 and not Pim2 and Pim3, the other members of the Pim family, with the aim of providing selective inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents and also of studying the different roles of the three enzymes. In this review Pim1 functions and Pim1 role in human cancer are summarized, but the primary focus of the article is on the Pim1 three-dimensional structure that was deeply analyzed by a detailed inspection of the available crystallographic data and all complexes of small molecule inhibitors reported in the literature to this point. Finally, the use of molecular modeling techniques for the identification and optimization of Pim1 inhibitors is extensively discussed.

Now, using NCI-H28 cells, which harbor a homozygous deletion of beta-catenin, we demonstrate that survivin transcription can similarly be mediated by nuclear gamma-catenin. ICG-001, a specific inhibitor of binding to the N-terminus of CBP, effectively attenuates survivin expression. We demonstrate that gamma-catenin by binding to TCF family members and specifically recruiting the coactivator CBP drives survivin transcription particularly in beta-catenin-deficient cells. We also examined the relative expression of gamma-catenin and beta-catenin in 90 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a published gene expression microarray data base. A statistically significant negative correlation between gamma-catenin and beta-catenin was found in AP/BC cases (-0.389, P = 0.006). Furthermore, in subsequent independent validation studies by qPCR in 28 CP and BC patients increased gamma-catenin expression predominated in BC cases and was associated with concomitantly increased survivin expression. Gene expression was 3- and 6-fold greater in BC patients as compared to CP patients, for gamma-catenin and survivin, respectively. Consistent with this observation, nuclear gamma-catenin accumulation was evident in this population consistent with a potential transcriptional role. Combined treatment with imatinib mesylate (IM) and ICG-001 significantly inhibited colony formation in sorted CD34(+) CML progenitors (survivin(+)/gamma-catenin(high)/beta-catenin(low)) isolated from one BC and one AP patient resistant to IM. Therefore, we believe that the ability of ICG-001 to block both the CBP/gamma-catenin interaction and the CBP/beta-catenin interaction may have clinical significance in cancers in which gamma-catenin plays a significant transcriptional role.",,"['Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Ma, Hong', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Gang, Eun Ji', 'Nguyen, Cu', 'Masiello, David', 'Liu, Han', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Kahn, Michael']","['Kim YM', 'Ma H', 'Oehler VG', 'Gang EJ', 'Nguyen C', 'Masiello D', 'Liu H', 'Zhao Y', 'Radich J', 'Kahn M']","['Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pediatrics, 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. ymkim@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA106796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (ICG 001)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (gamma Catenin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'CREB-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'TCF Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism', 'gamma Catenin/genetics/*metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,2010/12/17 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2010/12/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['EPub-Abstract-CCDT-97 [pii]', '10.2174/156800911794328420 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2011 Feb;11(2):213-25. doi: 10.2174/156800911794328420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One cat not in complete remission at the time of radiation therapy relapsed 2 weeks later, one cat with multicentric lymphoma relapsed with hepatic large granular lymphoma, and one cat was euthanatized 3 weeks following completion of radiation therapy for other reasons; no evidence of lymphoma or radiation toxicoses was identified on post mortem evaluation.

At the protein level, the helix-loop-helix domain and exon 5-coded central region of TEL are typically fused to almost entire AML1 including DNA-binding domain. PROCEDURE: We identified two ALL patients with genomic breakpoints within TEL intron 4 resulting in variant TEL/AML1 fusion lacking the TEL exon 5-coded central region. This region was supposed to play an important role in TEL/AML1 function, particularly in TEL/AML1-mediated transcriptional repression of AML1 targets. We aimed at investigating the impact of the loss of this region on disease behavior and TEL/AML1 function. We compared clinical and biological characteristics, treatment response, and outcome of the variant versus classical TEL/AML1 cases, analyzed genome wide gene expression profiles and performed reporter gene assay. RESULTS: No distinct differences between variant and classical TEL/AML1 cases were observed including gene expression profiling and detailed immunophenotyping. By using reporter gene assay, we showed that the loss of the central region does not influence the TEL/AML1-mediated transcriptional repression. CONCLUSIONS: The deletion of the central region did not affect the TEL/AML1-specific phenotype; we did not find any relevant differences in clinical and biological features when variant versus classical TEL/AML1-positive cases were compared. Thus, our data does not support hypothesis that the central region of TEL is indispensable for TEL/AML1 driven leukemogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Zaliova, Marketa', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Vaskova, Martina', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Stary, Jan', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Trka, Jan']","['Zaliova M', 'Meyer C', 'Cario G', 'Vaskova M', 'Marschalek R', 'Stary J', 'Zuna J', 'Trka J']","['CLIP, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic. marketa.zaliova@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101022,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/12/16 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/12/16 06:00'],"['2010/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22686 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Feb;56(2):217-25. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22686.

Previous reports on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with leukemia and solid malignancies concentrate on long-term survivors and on the effect of chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation. Also, evaluation of BMD in neuroblastoma was reported in few studies which were conducted upon adult survivors of childhood cancer. Previous studies on both acute leukemia and lymphoma patients suggested that the disease process itself played a role in decrease BMD. METHODS: We evaluated 27 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma for both lumbar (L2-L4) BMD and total BMD using dual energy X-ray absorptiometery (DXA) scan to highlight the effect of neuroblastoma as a disease process on BMD as this disease characterized by bone metastasis. RESULTS: Three out of the 27 patients showed low bone mass in both lumbar and total BMD studies. CONCLUSION: Low bone mass may occur in early disease process of neuroblastoma and it is important to consider BMD assessment during the early course of the disease as well as the long-term survivors as a part of the patient screening in suspected cases.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Al-Tonbary, Youssef A', 'El-Ziny, Magdy A', 'Elsharkawy, Ashraf A', 'El-Hawary, Amany K', 'El-Ashry, Rasha', 'Fouda, Ashraf E']","['Al-Tonbary YA', 'El-Ziny MA', 'Elsharkawy AA', 'El-Hawary AK', 'El-Ashry R', 'Fouda AE']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, Mansoura University Children's Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt. ytonbary@gmail.com""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101105,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/complications/pathology', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*etiology', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/complications/*pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/*secondary', 'Osteoporosis/*etiology']",,2010/12/16 06:00,2011/01/22 06:00,['2010/12/16 06:00'],"['2010/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22880 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Feb;56(2):202-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22880.

The largest proportion had leukemia and the group most severely impacted by their cancer and their therapies are the survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. This review describes the neurocognitive outcome for these groups and outlines work aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of and approach to ameliorating neurocognitive dysfunction. RECENT FINDINGS: The impact of chemotherapy on children treated for leukemia without radiation has been elucidated and the differential impact of different radiation fields and doses among children with CNS malignancies has been described. Newer imaging techniques may predict damage earlier and animal models of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity may prove valuable in designing less toxic therapies or finding protective agents. Cognitive training programs, notably computerized programs that can be accessed at home, may be part of successful programs for minimizing neurotoxicity. SUMMARY: This review seeks to describe the neurocognitive consequences of cancer and its therapy among pediatric patients treated for leukemia or a CNS tumor.

Despite improved understanding of the biology that underlies the graft-versus-leukemia/tumor effect the relapse rate did not decrease over the past 20 years. In general, prognosis is poor for patients who relapsed to an allograft since effective treatment options are limited. Here, we review the available and upcoming treatment approaches for relapse. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment of relapse after allogeneic HSCT has been rarely investigated systematically and results differ substantially from diseases. Withdrawal of immunosuppressive medication, donor lymphocyte infusions with or without chemotherapy and/or second allogeneic HSCT are the most used options. New specific cellular approaches such as disease-specific T-cells, alloreactive natural killer cells or vaccination strategies are under investigation. Novel agents such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulating drugs, or proteasome-inhibitors either alone or in combination with adoptive immunotherapy are upcoming promising options, but valid data are lacking so far. SUMMARY: With some exceptions (chronic myeloid leukemia), treatment options for patients who relapse are limited. The results are poor and the majority of patients ultimately die of their disease.

We investigated the significance of flow cytometric MRD detection for the first time in Korea. METHODS: We analyzed the results of MRD detection in morphologically complete remission bone marrow aspirates from 89 patients with newly-diagnosed or relapsed acute leukemia, in which leukemic cells had cross-lineage antigen expression. Patients were grouped based on MRD frequencies: >/= 1.0%, high MRD; <1.0%, low MRD. RESULTS: Forty-seven ALL patients consisted of 10 with high and 37 with low MRD levels. Patients with high MRD levels showed a tendency of more frequent relapse than those with low MRD levels (40.0% and 13.5%, respectively) (P=0.08). High MRD group showed a tendency of short relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), although the differences were not statistically significant. Forty-two AML patients consisted of 16 with high and 26 with low MRD levels. There were no correlations between the MRD levels and relapse rate, RFS or OS. AML patients with high MRD levels showed significantly higher rate of unfavorable cytogenetic risk categories and lower rate of favorable risk categories (P=0.03).

METHODS: A total of 22 MPAL patients, previously diagnosed by applying the scoring system of the European Group for Immunological Classification of Acute Leukemias (EGIL) were reclassified based on the 2008 WHO classification. RESULTS: In 2008 WHO classification, the number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) required for assigning more than one lineage was markedly decreased, from 26 to 11, compared with that of EGIL. Seventeen of the 22 MPAL patients were reclassified as MPAL with following details: 6 MPAL with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2); BCR-ABL1, 1 MPAL with t(v;11q23); MLL rearranged, 7 MPAL, B/Myeloid, not otherwise specified (NOS) and 3 MPAL, T/Myeloid, NOS. Five patients were excluded from MPAL in the revised classification: 4 cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase (cMPO)-negative and 1 CD19-negative. The failure of complete remission achievement and occurrence of relapse were associated with poor prognosis (P=0.0002 and P=0.009, respectively). But the presence of Philadelphia chromosome was not significantly related with patient outcome (P=0.082). One patient with cCD79a, CD20, CD38, cMPO and CD15, whose diagnosis was reclassified from MPAL to AML has survived during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Because of decreased number of mAbs needed, it is possible that acute leukemia panel is designed to include all mAbs required to diagnose MPAL according to 2008 WHO classification.

However, the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate granulopoiesis under inflammatory conditions are poorly understood. Here we show that the transcriptional coregulator B cell leukemia/lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) limits granulopoiesis under emergency (i.e., inflammatory) conditions, but not homeostatic conditions. Treatment of mouse myeloid progenitors with G-CSF--serum concentrations of which rise under inflammatory conditions--rapidly increased Bcl3 transcript accumulation in a STAT3-dependent manner. Bcl3-deficient myeloid progenitors demonstrated an enhanced capacity to proliferate and differentiate into granulocytes following G-CSF stimulation, whereas the accumulation of Bcl3 protein attenuated granulopoiesis in an NF-kappaB p50-dependent manner. In a clinically relevant model of transplant-mediated lung ischemia reperfusion injury, expression of Bcl3 in recipients inhibited emergency granulopoiesis and limited acute graft damage.

Most patients, however, harbor residual leukemia cells, and disease recurrence usually occurs when imatinib is discontinued. Although various mechanisms to explain leukemia cell persistence have been proposed, the critical question from a therapeutic standpoint--whether disease persistence is BCR-ABL dependent or independent--has not been answered. Here, we report that human CML stem cells do not depend on BCR-ABL activity for survival and are thus not eliminated by imatinib therapy.

However, recent work in other types of tumors has challenged the cancer stem cell model. Using a robust model of xenotransplantation based on NOD/SCID/IL2Rgammac-deficient mice, we confirmed that human leukemic stem cells, functionally defined by us as SCID leukemia-initiating cells (SL-ICs), are rare in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In contrast to previous results, SL-ICs were found among cells expressing lineage markers (i.e., among Lin+ cells), CD38, or CD45RA, all markers associated with normal committed progenitors. Remarkably, each engrafting fraction consistently recapitulated the original phenotypic diversity of the primary AML specimen and contained self-renewing leukemic stem cells, as demonstrated by secondary transplants. While SL-ICs were enriched in the Lin-CD38- fraction compared with the other fractions analyzed, SL-ICs in this fraction represented only one-third of all SL-ICs present in the unfractionated specimen.

Mouse leukaemia L1210 cell sublines that overexpress P-gp due to selection with vincristine (R) or stable transfection with a gene encoding human P-gp (T) were less sensitive to Th than the parental cell line (S). Th at a concentration of 0.1 mumol/l did not induce alterations in the amount of P-gp mRNA in R or T cells (S cells did not contain any measurable amount of this transcript as assessed by RT-PCR) or in the amount of calnexin (CNX) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in all three cell sublines. However, when using a concentration of 10 mumol/l, Th decreases the amounts of CNX, GAPDH (in S, R and T cells) and P-gp (in R and T cells) mRNAs. In contrast to R and T cells (which contain abundant P-gp), S cells did not contain any P-gp detectable by the c219 antibody on a Western blot. Th at a concentration of 0.1 mumol/l induced a reduction in the amount of P-gp present in R and T cells, particularly in isoforms with higher molecular weights (i.e., mature fully glycosylated isoforms). Similar results were observed when Th was used at a concentration of 10 mumol/l. R and T cells contained lower levels of CNX than S cells. While Th at a lower concentration did not alter the levels of CNX in S, R or T cells, a higher concentration of this substance induced a measurable decrease in the amount of CNX. S, R and T cells did not differ with respect to GAPDH content, but Th induced a reduction in the amount of this protein in all cell sublines. More pronounced results were observed when Th was applied at a concentration of 10 mumol/l comparing with a concentration of 0.1 mmol/l.

Direct comparisons between the most affected genes and also the cluster analysis indicated a relatively low degree of similarity between the tow expression profiles. Moreover, the ontological and the pathway responses also indicated a distinguished biological responses. Chromomycin treatment was characterized by many negative impacts on the important cellular functions and by the activation for those functions that usually take the cells towards apoptosis. In the second biological profile, the domination of many positive functions might indicate that the cells were attempting to overcome and repair the alkamin assault.

The decision was based on the favorable opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommending a conditional marketing authorization for ofatumumab for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. A conditional marketing authorization means that additional data to confirm the benefit-risk balance of ofatumumab are awaited. The active substance of Arzerra(R) is ofatumumab, a monoclonal antibody medicinal product (ATC code L01XC10). The recommended dose is 300 mg of atumumab for the first infusion and 2,000 mg of atumumab for all subsequent infusions. The infusion schedule is eight consecutive weekly infusions, followed 4-5 weeks later by four consecutive monthly (i.e., every 4 weeks) infusions. Ofatumumab targets CD20, a cell surface marker of B lymphocytes, which is followed by cell lysis via complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The benefit of ofatumumab is the control of CLL in patients who are refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab, which was indicated by a high response rate. The most common side effects are infections and infusion reactions. The objective of this paper is to summarize the scientific review of the application leading to approval in the EU.

Historically, the chemotherapy regimen CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) has been the standard treatment of this rare malignancy. However, its prognosis is poor and median survival in the aggressive variants of ATLL is only 6-10 months. Recently, a more aggressive regimen piloted in Japan, vincristine/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/prednisone (VCAP)- doxorubicin/ranimustine/prednisone (AMP)- vindesine/etoposide/carboplatin/prednisone (VECP), has been reported to yield better survival results over biweekly CHOP in a phase III trial. However, the hyper- cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (CVAD) regimen is a much more frequently used regimen for the treatment of aggressive hematologic malignancies, and has a higher intensity then CHOP. Yet, there is little reported experience with hyper-CVAD regimen in ATLL. CASE REPORTS: We present 2 patients diagnosed with ATLL who were treated with hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and have achieved a durable complete remission.

In addition, we measured multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins on pretreatment bone marrows and correlated expression with outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed in a 2-stage design. Pretreatment bone marrows were assayed for the MDR proteins (LRP, MDR1, MRP1, SLC28-29A1/A2, ABCC4/C5, and GSTP1) by immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Only 5 of the first 24 patients (21%) achieved CR; therefore, the study was terminated. Eleven patients (46%) had poor-risk cytogenetics and the median duration of first CR was 7.3 months. Patients had significant expression of the various MDR genes, with 70% of patients expressing moderate to high levels of GSTP1 by immunohistochemistry. Higher sum total of ABCC4 and SLC29A2 expression measured by RT-PCR was associated with not achieving CR (20.6 vs. 12.1; P = .006). In addition, there was a trend for higher expression of the sum total of the 10 MDR genes (measured by RT-PCR) and not achieving CR (P = .06). CONCLUSION: The CR rate in this study was comparable to other regimens used in poor-risk patients. Of interest, ABCC4 and SLC29A2 expression were predictive of achieving CR. The high expression of GSTP1 suggests that this may be a therapeutic target for relapsed AML. Finally, the rapidity and ease of using RT-PCR to quantify MDR in this study may have clinical utility in future trials.",,"['Advani, Anjali S', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Ali-Osman, Francis', 'Barker, Andrew', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'de Castro, Carlos M', 'Diehl, Louis F', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Beaven, Anne', 'Copelan, Ed', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Talea, Parisa', 'Rizzieri, David A']","['Advani AS', 'Shadman M', 'Ali-Osman F', 'Barker A', 'Rybicki L', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sekeres MA', 'de Castro CM', 'Diehl LF', 'Moore JO', 'Beaven A', 'Copelan E', 'Sobecks R', 'Talea P', 'Rizzieri DA']","['Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. advania@ccf.org']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'U937 Cells']",,2010/12/16 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2010/12/16 06:00'],"['2010/12/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)70049-0 [pii]', '10.3816/CLML.2010.n.082 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2010 Dec;10(6):473-6. doi: 10.3816/CLML.2010.n.082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a study evaluating the presenting symptoms that led to the diagnosis of MM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 170 consecutive patients with MM seen at the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute. RESULTS: Among patients with symptomatic MM, 74% presented with CRAB symptoms, 20% presented with non-CRAB manifestations, and 6% had both clinical features. Ten categories of non-CRAB manifestations were found, in order of decreasing frequency: neuropathy (because of spinal cord compression, nerve root compression, or peripheral neuropathy), extramedullary involvement, hyperviscosity syndrome, concomitant amyloidosis (eg, nephrotic syndrome or cardiopathy), hemorrhage/coagulopathy, systemic symptoms (eg, fever or weight loss), primary plasma cell leukemia, infections, cryoglobulinemia, and secondary gout. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival in patients with non-CRAB manifestations did not show a significant difference from the survival of patients presenting with CRAB symptoms. CONCLUSION: Presenting symptoms of MM may be grouped in a total of 14 categories, 4 for the CRAB and 10 for the less common non-CRAB features.

However, a third of patients either fail to respond or respond suboptimally to imatinib therapy, while some others are intolerant to imatinib. Increased understanding of the molecular basis of imatinib resistance has led to rational development of second-generation TKIs as effective second-line treatment options for imatinib-resistant patients. However, persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) and development of resistance against TKI therapy are proving to be significant challenges. Treatment options are evolving for patients with CML and the promising results with several novel agents showing activity in CML, including in patients with the T315I mutation, are encouraging advancements in the field.

Samples derived from 75 patients with ALL (B-ALL = 24, T-ALL = 51) and from healthy volunteers were analyzed. PAX5 expression was assessed by micro-array analysis (HG-U133plus 2.0) and correlated with promoter CpG island methylation of PAX5 using a pyrosequencing approach.

All four patients had two malignant clones: one with only t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) and another with der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)inv(9)(p22q34) that resulted in the separation of the ABL1/BCR fusion gene. No metaphases with only inv(9)(p22q34) were seen in any of them. FISH also found a deletion of partial sequence of BCR on der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)inv(9)(p22q34) in 67.5% of bone marrow cells in the AML patient, but did not detect the deletion of the sequence of ASS/9q34 in these four patients. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed a b3a2 type of BCR/ABL1 fusion transcript in all of them, proving their disease to be Ph-positive leukemia. On reviewing the literature, only two solitary Ph-positive leukemia patients have been noticed to have the inv(9)(p22q34) anomaly. These two patients, together with our four documented patients, indicate that inv(9)(p22q34) is a novel, rare, but recurrent secondary chromosomal abnormality for Ph-positive leukemia. Despite receiving hydroxyurea therapy (n = 3 patients), combined chemotherapy (n = 2), even imatinib treatment (n = 1), three patients, including one with AML and two with CML (one of whom progressed into the lymphoblastic blast phase), died with survival times of 28 days, 13 months, and 34 months, respectively. Only one patient with CML remained alive for 5.5 months. Their negative outcome implies that inv(9)(p22q34) has an unfavorable impact on prognosis. Presently, no firm conclusions can be drawn from this study. Because the case number reported here is very small, more patients with this anomaly need to be investigated to elucidate its true prognostic significance.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) is generally thought to be strongly associated with poor prognosis in AML, but is rarely reported in patients with t(8;21)-AML. Expression of the neural cell-adhesion molecule (CD56) is also associated with a significantly shorter complete remission duration and survival in patients with t(8;21)-AML. Patients with t(8;21)-AML expressing CD56 have been reported to exhibit a higher incidence of granulocytic sarcoma (GS), and t(8;21)-AML with GS results in a less favorable prognosis than AML with this translocation alone. Here, we report on a 15-year-old girl with t(8;21)-AML having both CD56 expression and FLT3-ITD. This patient underwent unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation and achieved complete remission, but thereafter presented with obstructive jaundice caused by GS compression of the common bile duct without bone marrow invasion at relapse. Autopsy revealed multiple nodules of the stomach membrane and invasion into the head of the pancreas. For earlier detection of relapse, we suggest that it would be useful to examine existence of GS in CD56-positive t(8;21)-AML patients at diagnosis and hematologic remission. Even though t(8;21)-AML is less likely to co-occur with FLT3-ITD in pediatric patients, this report suggests that prognostic factors, including FLT3 and KIT genes and the surface marker CD56, should be analyzed in these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As the number of pediatric cancer survivors increases, there is a concern about the development of secondary malignant neoplasms. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been rarely reported after treatment for OS. We describe a 14-year-old boy with OS of the left ileum who developed secondary AML 15 months after completion of treatment. Cytogenetic analysis of the leukemic cells demonstrated deletion 11q23, whereas fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed rearrangement of the MLL gene. Only the addition of the long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction technique identified the SEPT2 as the MLL fusion partner resulting in t(2;11)(q37;q23) that was reported in a very few secondary AML cases. Because of the cryptic nature of MLL translocations that cannot be detected by conventional cytogenetics or may misinterpreted as deletion, additional molecular techniques are required to identify the precise translocation partner. Because long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction is not available in most molecular laboratories, the true incidence of t(2;11)(q37;q23) and the involvement of SEPT2 as the MLL translocation partner could be more prevalent in secondary AML.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Early molecular response (EMR), defined as >50% reduction in the ratio of BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 within 6 months after dose escalation, was a major endpoint for analysis. After aCGH analysis, copy number change of four genes was investigated in 52 patients as a validation. Copy number gain in 16p11.2 was more frequently observed in patients with EMR than in patients who failed to achieve EMR (P = 0.034). A tendency for increased copy number in 22q11.23 in patients without EMR and for decreased copy number in 17q12 in patients with EMR was observed (P = 0.072 and P = 0.070, respectively). For GSTT1, in 22q11.23, copy number gain was observed in patients without EMR (P = 0.035). GSTT1 copy number gain was related to short time to treatment failure (TTFx) in patients without BCR-ABL1 mutations (P = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, GSTT1 copy number gain was an independent predictive factor for short TTFx (P = 0.020). We conclude that chromosome regions 16p11.2, 22q11.23, and 17q12 are potential locations related to response in imatinib dose escalation therapy for CML.

The most common acquired chromosomal aberrations in FA patients are trisomy of 1q and monosomy of chromosome 7; the latter is known to be associated with poor prognosis. A few reports also suggest that gains of 3q are associated with progression to MDS-AML and overall poor prognosis. It is not uncommon for patients with Fanconi anemia to have easily detectable (oligoclonal) chromosomal alterations in their still normal (nonmalignant) marrow, which makes it even more challenging to determine the import of such alterations. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for gains in 1q and 3q and for monosomy 7 and 7q deletions on 212 bone marrow samples from 77 children with FA treated at our institution between 1987 and 2007. Given the baseline increased chromosomal instability and defective DNA repair in patients with FA, which leads to unbalanced chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, insertions, and translocations, for the purpose of this analysis an abnormal clone was defined as >/=10% abnormal cells. Chromosome 3 and 7 aberrations were associated with increased risk of developing MDS-AML (P = 0.019 and P < 0.001 respectively), although the significance of chromosome 3 aberrations disappeared when different observation times were accounted for. Gain of 1q alone did not predict development of MDS-AML. In conclusion, children with FA should be followed closely with FISH analyses, because some of the clonal chromosomal abnormalities may be early indicators of progression toward MDS-AML and thus also of the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A strong concordance between chromosomal gain or loss and increased or reduced expression of genes in the affected regions was found, respectively. Regions of uniparental disomy (UPD) were rare and had usually no consistent influence on gene expression, but in one instance, a large UPD was associated with a downregulation of most genes in the affected chromosome. The frequently deleted miRNAs, MIRN15A and MIRN16-1, did not show a reduced expression in cases with monoallelic deletions. The BCL2 protein, considered to be downregulated by these miRNAs, was upregulated not only in CLL with biallelic deletion of MIRN15A and MIRN16-1, but also in cases with monoallelic deletion.

This investigation used fixed bone marrow and blood cells available from previous conventional cytogenetic or FISH studies in two pilot studies, a one-day workshop, and proficiency test. Multiple FISH probe strategies were used to detect 6q-, 11q-, +12, 13q-, 17p-, and IGH rearrangements. Ten specimens were studied by participants who used their own probes (pilot study 1). Of 312 FISH interpretations, 224 (72%) were true-negative, 74 (24%) true-positive, 6 (2%) false-negative, and 8 (3%) false-positive. In pilot study no. 2, each participant studied two specimens using identical FISH probe sets to control for variation due to probe sets and probe strategies. Of 80 FISH interpretations, no false interpretations were identified. At a subsequent workshop, discussions produced agreement on scoring criteria. The proficiency test that followed produced no false-negative results and 4% (3/68) false-positive interpretations. Interpretation disagreements among laboratories were primarily attributable to inadequate normal cutoffs, inconsistent scoring criteria, and the use of different FISH probe strategies. Collaborative organizations that use pooled FISH results may wish to impose more conservative empiric normal cutoff values or use an equivocal range between the normal cutoff and the abnormal reference range to eliminate false-positive interpretations. False-negative results will still occur, and would be expected in low-percentage positive cases; these would likely have less clinical significance than false positive results. Individual laboratories can help by closely following rigorous quality assurance guidelines to ensure accurate and consistent FISH studies in their clinical practice and research.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Historically, only interphase cytogenetics was clinically useful in CLL, because traditional mitogens are not effective mitotic stimulants. Recently, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) stimulation has shown effectiveness in CLL cells. The CLL Research Consortium tested the effectiveness and reproducibility of CpG-ODN stimulation for detecting chromosomally abnormal clones by five laboratories. More clonal abnormalities were observed after culture of CLL cells with CpG-ODN than with the traditional pokeweed mitogen plus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PWM+TPA). All clonal abnormalities in PWM+TPA cultures were observed in CpG-ODN cultures, whereas CpG-ODN identified some clones not found by PWM+TPA. CpG-ODN stimulation of one normal control sample and 12 CLL samples showed that, excepting clones of del(13q) in low frequencies and one translocation, results in all five laboratories were consistent, and all abnormalities were concordant with FISH. Abnormal clones in CLL were more readily detected with CpG-ODN stimulation than with traditional B-cell mitogens. With CpG-ODN stimulation, abnormalities were reproducible among cytogenetic laboratories. CpG-ODN did not appear to induce aberrations in cell culture, but did enhance detection of abnormalities and complexity in CLL.

CLL is characterized by the clonal expansion of immature CD5(+) B cells. Although cytotoxic agents remain the mainstay of therapy, the disease of up to 20% of patients is not controlled with standard therapies. Therefore, there remains a need for novel therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), first identified nearly two decades ago, are noncoding RNAs that have the capacity for simultaneous regulation of tens to hundreds of genes. An association between CLL-associated chromosomal abnormalities and miRNA deregulation is beginning to emerge. miRNAs may play a biological role in the pathogenesis of CLL: specific miRNAs (miR-15a and miR-16-1) are located at a chromosomal region (13q14.3) that is often absent in patients with CLL. These same miRNAs are relevant to cellular phenotype and in vivo development of disease. This finding has led to a rapidly expanding series of investigations linking miRNAs to CLL. As a result, miRNAs are currently under investigation as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets in CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It promotes induced myeloid maturation when overexpressed, whereas knocking it down is inhibitory. It is a type II membrane protein with an extracellular C-terminal enzymatic domain with NADase/NADPase and ADPR cyclase activity and a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail. Here we determined whether CD38 enzymatic activity or the cytoplasmic tail is required for ATRA-induced differentiation. Neither a specific CD38 ectoenzyme inhibitor nor a point mutation that cripples enzymatic activity (CD38 E226Q) diminishes ATRA-induced differentiation or G1/0 arrest. In contrast a cytosolic deletion mutation (CD38 Delta11-20) prevents membrane expression and inhibits differentiation and G1/0 arrest. These results may be consistent with disrupting the function of critical molecules necessary for membrane-expressed CD38 signal transduction. One candidate molecule is the Src family kinase Fgr, which failed to undergo ATRA-induced upregulation in CD38 Delta11-20 expressing cells. Another is Vav1, which also showed only basal expression after ATRA treatment in CD38 Delta11-20 expressing cells. Therefore, the ability of CD38 to propel ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation and G1/0 arrest is unimpaired by loss of its ectoenzyme activity. However a cytosolic tail deletion mutation disrupted membrane localization and inhibited differentiation. ATRA-induced differentiation thus does not require the CD38 ectoenzyme function, but is dependent on a membrane receptor function.",['Copyright (c) 2010.

The ligand 1 and complex 2 are structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The coordination geometries around the copper are square planar in solid as well as solution state as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The density functional calculations carried out on 1-3 have shown that electron-rich regions in the highest occupied orbital are localized on the naphthalene and partly on the phenanthroline moiety. Both complexes 2 and 3 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) exhibit near square planar structure around the metal ion in their ground state. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations reveal that Cu(II) ion in complex 2 shows tetrahedral coordination around the metal while 3 retains its square planar geometry in the lowest excited state. The interaction of complexes with calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been explored by using absorption, emission, thermal denaturation, and viscosity studies, and the intercalating mode of DNA binding has been proposed. The complexes cleave DNA oxidatively without any exogenous additives. The protein binding ability has been monitored by quenching of tryptophan emission in the presence of complexes using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as model protein. The compounds showed dynamic quenching behavior. Further, the anticancer activity of the complexes on MCF-7 (human breast cancer), HeLa (human cervical cancer), HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia), and MCF-12A (normal epithelial) cell lines has been studied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained serum samples from 40 patients with RA and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy controls, and we assessed the clinical parameters of disease activity, including the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Serum samples from five patients with high disease activity (DAS28 > 5.1) were also collected at the eighth week of treatment. Serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Serum concentrations of IL-6 family cytokines, including IL-6, IL-11, and LIF, were significantly elevated in patients with RA compared to those of healthy controls. Although there was no significant relationship between IL-6 family cytokine levels and DAS28, the IL-6 levels of patients with RA showed a significant correlation with CRP levels. After eight weeks of medical treatment in patients with high disease activity, a decrease in DAS28 was associated with a significant decrease in the serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-11. CONCLUSION: The serum concentrations of IL-6 family cytokines were significantly elevated in patients with RA, and they decreased with medical treatment.

The purpose of this study was to identify the factor(s) produced by fibroblasts that induce myocyte hypertrophy. The fibroblast hypertrophy activity was inhibited using a combination of the endothelin A receptor blocker BQ-123 and an antibody to leukemia inhibitory factor. The individual antagonists each caused a partial inhibition. The mRNAs for both leukemia inhibitory factor and endothelin were detected by RT-PCR analysis and the concentration of both proteins was determined to be approximately 200 pmol/L in the conditioned medium using immunoassays. Purified leukemia inhibitory factor and endothelin each induced distinctive morphological changes in the myocytes. Their combination generated a different morphology similar to that induced by fibroblast conditioned medium. Each factor also induced atrial natriuretic peptide production, but both were required for the myocytes to produce the levels measured after exposure to fibroblast conditioned medium.

Despite this progress, resistance to trastuzumab occurs in most patients. Newer anti-HER2 therapies, like the dual tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) lapatinib, show significant antitumor activity, indicating that HER2 can be still exploited as a target after trastuzumab failure. However, since a high proportion of patients fail to respond to these alternative strategies, it is possible that cell escape from HER2 targeting may rely on HER2 independent pathways. The knowledge of these pathways deserve to be exploited to develop new therapies. We characterized two human HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines resistant to trastuzumab and lapatinib (T100 and JIMT-1) from a molecular and biological point of view. Indeed, we assessed both in vitro and in vivo the activity of the multitarget inhibitor sorafenib. In both cell lines, the previously proposed mechanisms did not explain resistance to HER2 inhibitors. Notably, silencing HER2 by shRNA did not affect the growth of our cells, suggesting loss of reliance upon HER2. Moreover, we identified alterations in two antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Survivin which are known to be targets of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Moreover, sorafenib, strongly inhibited the in vitro growth of T100 and JIMT-1 cells, through the downregulation of both Mcl-1 and Survivin. Similar results were obtained in JIMT-1 xenografts subcutaneously injected in NOD SCID mice.

METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were enrolled. All the patients were treated with HAG regimen (HHT 1.5 mg/m(2)/day, 1-14d; Ara-C 7.5 mg/m(2)/12 h, 1-14d; G-CSF 150 mug/m(2)/day, according to the counting of the peripheral white blood cells). Blood cell counting, liver, kidney function, ECG and myocardial enzymes were monitored regularly. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 67 (52.2%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 8/67 (11.9%) partial remission (PR). The overall response rate was 64.1%. Myelosuppression was the most frequently observed adverse effect.

The molecular mechanisms of action of imatinib in glioblastoma cells are still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of imatinib on the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) downstream signaling pathways as well as on other cellular functions in human glioblastoma cells. NIH3T3 fibroblast and K562 CML cells were used for comparison. Western blot analysis demonstrated that imatinib was more effective in inhibiting the activated rather than the quiescent forms of the target proteins. Furthermore, the imatinib treatment induced the sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) signaling as well as components of other downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, STAT3 and p38MAPK. Prior stimulation of the malignant cells with exogenous PDGF-BB partially abrogated this activation. Further analysis indicated that the activation of ERK induced by the imatinib treatment was related to the S-phase re-entry of the cell cycle in one of the three glioma cells. Imatinib significantly inhibited cell migration but not cell growth. The combination treatment of imatinib with a MEK or PI3K inhibitor resulted in significant growth inhibition but did not inhibit cell migration beyond the inhibition achieved with the imatinib treatment alone. The treatment of glioma cells with small interfering RNA inhibiting PDGFRB, however, evoked enhanced Akt signaling. These results indicate that the imatinib treatment of malignant glioma does not result in significant inhibitory effects and should be used with caution.",,"['Dong, Yucui', 'Jia, Limin', 'Wang, Xiaohua', 'Tan, Xiaoqing', 'Xu, Jiankai', 'Deng, Zhenling', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Rainov, Nikolai G', 'Li, Baoxin', 'Ren, Huan']","['Dong Y', 'Jia L', 'Wang X', 'Tan X', 'Xu J', 'Deng Z', 'Jiang T', 'Rainov NG', 'Li B', 'Ren H']","['Department of Immunology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101206,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Becaplermin', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wound Healing/drug effects']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2010.861 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Feb;38(2):555-69. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2010.861.

The accumulation of MTX and its active metabolites, methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG), in ALL cells is an important determinant of its antileukemic effects. We studied 194 of 356 patients enrolled on St. Jude Total XV protocol for newly diagnosed ALL with the goal of characterizing the intracellular pharmacokinetics of MTXPG in leukemia cells; relating these pharmacokinetics to ALL lineage, ploidy and molecular subtype; and using a folate pathway model to simulate optimal treatment strategies. Serial MTX concentrations were measured in plasma and intracellular MTXPG concentrations were measured in circulating leukemia cells. A pharmacokinetic model was developed which accounted for the plasma disposition of MTX along with the transport and metabolism of MTXPG. In addition, a folate pathway model was adapted to simulate the effects of treatment strategies on the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis (DNPS). The intracellular MTXPG pharmacokinetic model parameters differed significantly by lineage, ploidy, and molecular subtypes of ALL. Folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity was higher in B vs T lineage ALL (p<0.005), MTX influx and FPGS activity were higher in hyperdiploid vs non-hyperdiploid ALL (p<0.03), MTX influx and FPGS activity were lower in the t(12;21) (ETV6-RUNX1) subtype (p<0.05), and the ratio of FPGS to gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) activity was lower in the t(1;19) (TCF3-PBX1) subtype (p<0.03) than other genetic subtypes. In addition, the folate pathway model showed differential inhibition of DNPS relative to MTXPG accumulation, MTX dose, and schedule.

This paper introduces a new hierarchical clustering problem defined by a novel objective function we call the arithmetic-harmonic cut. We show that the problem of finding such a cut is NP-hard and APX-hard but is fixed-parameter tractable, which indicates that although the problem is unlikely to have a polynomial time algorithm (even for approximation), exact parameterized and local search based techniques may produce workable algorithms. To this end, we implement a memetic algorithm for the problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of the arithmetic-harmonic cut on a number of datasets including a cancer type dataset and a corona virus dataset. We show favorable performance compared to currently used hierarchical clustering techniques such as k-Means, Graclus and Normalized-Cut.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Induction chemotherapy consisted of 2 cycles (4 courses) of doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 15), cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) (day 1), and ifosfamide 5 g/m(2) (days 2 and 15). The primary endpoint was good histologic response [ghr (</=5% identifiable tumour cells)]. RESULTS: From March 1993 to March 2000, 32 patients [median age: 21 years (range: 15-49 years)] were administered 126 induction courses. The median time between chemotherapy courses was 15 days (range: 12-32 days). All but 3 patients underwent conservative surgery. Toxicity was mainly hematologic, with febrile neutropenia occurring in 35% of patients and grades 3-4 thrombocytopenia in 35%. The ghr rate was 47%. The median follow-up was 64 months (range: 30-115 months). The 5-year event-free and overall survivals were 65% [95% confidence interval (ci): 48%-79%] and 69% (95% ci: 50%-83%) respectively. Two secondary hematologic malignancies occurred: 1 acute myelocytic leukemia (M5) in a poor responder with concomitant relapse, and 1 myelodysplastic syndrome in a patient achieving ghr. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hematologic toxicity, the results observed with the api-ai regimen compare favourably with those observed during previous induction chemotherapy containing methotrexate in adult patients and the pediatric population treated at our institution.

In contrast, cancer cells can express constitutively active oncogenic kinases such as BCR-Abl that promote these processes independent of extrinsic growth factors. When cells receive insufficient growth signals or when oncogenic kinases are inhibited, glucose metabolism decreases and the self-digestive process of autophagy is elevated to degrade bulk cytoplasm and organelles. Although autophagy has been proposed to provide a cell-intrinsic nutrient supply for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and to maintain cellular homeostasis through degradation of damaged organelles or protein aggregates, its acute role in growth factor deprivation or inhibition of oncogenic kinases remains poorly understood. We therefore developed a growth factor-dependent hematopoietic cell culture model in which autophagy can be acutely disrupted through conditional Cre-mediated excision of the autophagy-essential gene Atg3. Treated cells rapidly lost their ability to perform autophagy and underwent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Although Atg3 was essential for optimal upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative pathways in growth factor withdrawal, this metabolic contribution of autophagy did not appear critical for cell survival, as provision of exogenous pyruvate or lipids could not completely rescue Atg3 deficiency. Instead, autophagy suppressed a stress response that otherwise led to p53 phosphorylation and upregulation of p21 and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Puma. Importantly, BCR-Abl-expressing cells had low basal levels of autophagy, but were highly dependent on this process, and rapidly underwent apoptosis upon disruption of autophagy through Atg3 deletion or treatment with chemical autophagy inhibitors. This dependence on autophagy extended in vivo, as Atg3 deletion also prevented BCR-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis in a cell transfer model. Together these data demonstrate a critical role for autophagy to mitigate cell stress, and that cells expressing the oncogenic kinase BCR-Abl appear particularly dependent on autophagy for cell survival and leukemogenesis.",,"['Altman, B J', 'Jacobs, S R', 'Mason, E F', 'Michalek, R D', 'MacIntyre, A N', 'Coloff, J L', 'Ilkayeva, O', 'Jia, W', 'He, Y-W', 'Rathmell, J C']","['Altman BJ', 'Jacobs SR', 'Mason EF', 'Michalek RD', 'MacIntyre AN', 'Coloff JL', 'Ilkayeva O', 'Jia W', 'He YW', 'Rathmell JC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['F30 HL094044/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI074944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123350-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101213,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['*Autophagy', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Oxidative Stress']",PMC3081401,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/06/18 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010561 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.561 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Apr 21;30(16):1855-67. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.561.

METHODS: Jurkat cells, Jurkat-derived vav1-null cells (J.Vav1) and Vav1-reconstituted J.WT cells were treated with a Fas agonist antibody, IgM clone CH11. Apoptosis was determined using propidium iodide (PI) staining, Annexin-V staining, DNA fragmentation, cleavage of caspase 3/caspase 8, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Mitochondria transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) was measured using DiOC(6)(3) staining. Transcription and expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins were evaluated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Bcl-2 promoter activity was analyzed using luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: Cells lacking Vav1 were more sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis than Jurkat and J.WT cells. J.Vav1 cells lost mitochondria transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) more rapidly upon Fas induction. These phenotypes could be rescued by re-expression of Vav1 in J.Vav1 cells. The expression of Vav1 increased the transcription of pro-survival Bcl-2. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Vav1 was required for enhancing Bcl-2 promoter activity, and the Vav1 downstream substrate, small GTPase Rac2, was likely involved in the control of Bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSION: Vav1 protects Jurkat cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis by promoting Bcl-2 transcription through its GEF activity.",,"['Yin, Jie', 'Wan, Ya-juan', 'Li, Shi-yang', 'Du, Ming-juan', 'Zhang, Cui-zhu', 'Zhou, Xing-long', 'Cao, You-jia']","['Yin J', 'Wan YJ', 'Li SY', 'Du MJ', 'Zhang CZ', 'Zhou XL', 'Cao YJ']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101213,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/*genetics/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",PMC4003318,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2010185 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2010.185 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2011 Jan;32(1):99-107. doi: 10.1038/aps.2010.185.

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signalling through the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway enables self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we show that mouse ES cells carrying the human JAK2V617F mutation were able to self-renew in chemically defined conditions without cytokines or small-molecule inhibitors, independently of JAK signalling through the STAT3 or phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathways. Phosphorylation of histone H3 tyrosine 41 (H3Y41) by JAK2 was recently shown to interfere with binding of heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha). Levels of chromatin-bound HP1alpha were lower in JAK2V617F ES cells but increased following inhibition of JAK2, coincident with a global reduction in histone H3Y41 phosphorylation. JAK2 inhibition reduced levels of the pluripotency regulator Nanog, with a reduction in H3Y41 phosphorylation and concomitant increase in HP1alpha levels at the Nanog promoter. Furthermore, Nanog was required for factor independence of JAK2V617F ES cells. Taken together, these results uncover a previously unrecognized role for direct signalling to chromatin by JAK2 as an important mediator of ES cell self-renewal.",,"['Griffiths, Dean S', 'Li, Juan', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Trotter, Matthew W B', 'Cheng, Yi-Han', 'Smith, Aileen M', 'Mansfield, William', 'Liu, Pentao', 'Kouzarides, Tony', 'Nichols, Jennifer', 'Bannister, Andrew J', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Griffiths DS', 'Li J', 'Dawson MA', 'Trotter MW', 'Cheng YH', 'Smith AM', 'Mansfield W', 'Liu P', 'Kouzarides T', 'Nichols J', 'Bannister AJ', 'Green AR', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology and Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK. dsg29@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['G0900729/1/NC3RS_/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction', 'of Animals in Research/United Kingdom', 'G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'A8043/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'G0600275/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000847/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101212,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Adult Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polycythemia Vera/metabolism/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",PMC3008749,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ncb2135 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb2135 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2011 Jan;13(1):13-21. doi: 10.1038/ncb2135.

However, deletions this small do not occur in all patients and are a simplification of the impact larger heterogeneous deletions have during carcinogenesis. We use the example of 13q14 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia to show that genes outside MDRs are associated with disease progression. Genomic profiling of 224 patients identified 205 copy number alterations on chromosome 13 in 132 cases. Deletions including DLEU2 were heterogeneous (845 Kb-96.2 Mb) and identified two breakpoint cluster regions within short interspersed nuclear elements proximal to DLEU2 and within long interspersed nuclear elements/L1 repeats distal to GUCY1B2. After defining a deletion class on the basis of size and location, we show that (a) at diagnosis, larger deletions (class II) were associated with a significantly increased risk of disease progression (odds ratio=12.3; P=0.005), (b) in progressive patients, class II deletions were enriched (P=0.02) and (c) this association was independent of IgVH mutational status, ZAP70 expression and ATM/TP53 deletion. Deletion of a 1 Mb gene cluster (48.2-49.2 Mb), including SETDB2, PHF11 and RCBTB1, was significantly associated (P<0.01) with disease progression.

Using a series of T-cell lines infected with human T lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I), the causative virus of ATL, we have dissected the transformation from interleukin (IL)-2-dependent to -independent growth stage. The transformation associates the loss of thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2), a tumor suppressor and regulator of lipid metabolism. Here we show that TBP-2 is responsible for GC-induced apoptosis in ATL cells. In the IL-2-dependent stage, dexamethasone induced TBP-2 expression and apoptosis, both of which were blocked by GC receptor (GR) antagonist RU486. Knockdown of TBP-2 consistently reduced the amount of GC-induced apoptosis. In IL-2-independent stage, however, expression of GR and TBP-2 was suppressed and GC failed to induce apoptosis. Forced expression of GR led the cells to mild sensitivity to GC, which was also accomplished by treatment with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a TBP-2 inducer. A transfection experiment showed that TBP-2 expression induced apoptosis in IL-2-independent ATL cells. Thus, TBP-2 is likely to be one of the key molecules for GC-induced apoptosis and a potential target for treating the advanced stage of ATL.",,"['Chen, Z', 'Lopez-Ramos, D A', 'Yoshihara, E', 'Maeda, Y', 'Masutani, H', 'Sugie, K', 'Maeda, M', 'Yodoi, J']","['Chen Z', 'Lopez-Ramos DA', 'Yoshihara E', 'Maeda Y', 'Masutani H', 'Sugie K', 'Maeda M', 'Yodoi J']","['Laboratory of Infection and Prevention, Department of Biological Response, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101210,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/analysis/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Vorinostat']",PMC3072512,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010286 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.286 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Mar;25(3):440-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.286.

Differences in miRNA expression of MDS subtypes showed a distinction between early and advanced MDS; an apparent dissimilarity was observed between RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 subtypes. In early MDS, we monitored upregulation of proapoptotic miR-34a, which may contribute to the increased apoptosis of HSCs.

Fifty-two children with ALL, 19 children with ALL 1-10 years after the completion of therapy, and 28 healthy children were studied. In children with ALL, there was a significant increase in thrombomodulin (TM) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels during the acute phase of the disease and during treatment. Children with an unfavorable outcome had higher levels of TM. In conclusion, severe endothelial dysfunction is present during the acute phase of ALL and during treatment and appears to result from the disease itself.

The main objective of this study was to refine DIPSS by incorporating prognostic information from karyotype, platelet count, and transfusion status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mayo Clinic databases for PMF were used to identify patients with available bone marrow histologic and cytogenetic information. RESULTS: Seven hundred ninety-three consecutive patients were selected and divided into two groups based on whether or not their referral occurred within (n = 428; training set) or after (n = 365; test set) 1 year of diagnosis. Multivariable analysis identified DIPSS, unfavorable karyotype, platelets lower than 100 x 10(9)/L, and transfusion need as independent predictors of inferior survival. Hazard ratio (HR)-weighted adverse points were assigned to these variables to develop a composite prognostic model using the training set. The model was subsequently validated in the test set, and its application to all 793 patients resulted in median survivals of 185, 78, 35, and 16 months for low, intermediate-1 (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.6), intermediate-2 (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 3.2 to 7.7), and high-risk groups (HR, 10.7; 95% CI, 6.8 to 16.9), respectively (P < .001). Leukemia-free survival was predicted by the presence of thrombocytopenia or unfavorable karyotype (10-year risk of 31% v 12%; HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.6). CONCLUSION: DIPSS plus effectively combines prognostic information from DIPSS, karyotype, platelet count, and transfusion status to predict overall survival in PMF. In addition, unfavorable karyotype or thrombocytopenia predicts inferior leukemia-free survival.",,"['Gangat, Naseema', 'Caramazza, Domenica', 'Vaidya, Rakhee', 'George, Geeta', 'Begna, Kebede', 'Schwager, Susan', 'Van Dyke, Daniel', 'Hanson, Curtis', 'Wu, Wenting', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Passamonti, Francesco', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Gangat N', 'Caramazza D', 'Vaidya R', 'George G', 'Begna K', 'Schwager S', 'Van Dyke D', 'Hanson C', 'Wu W', 'Pardanani A', 'Cervantes F', 'Passamonti F', 'Tefferi A']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101213,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Transfusion/*mortality', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Databases as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Count', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.2446 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2446 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Feb 1;29(4):392-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2446.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All Nordic children with AML younger than 15 years (n = 151) were treated on the Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) AML 2004 protocol. After the first course of idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide, and 6-thioguanin, patients with good response were allowed hematologic recovery before the second course, whereas patients with a poor (>/= 15% blasts) or intermediate (5% to 14.9% blasts) were recommended to proceed immediately with therapy. Patients not in remission after the second course received fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Poor responders received allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) as consolidation. RESULTS: Seventy-four percent of patients had good response, 17% had intermediate response, and 7% had poor response after the first course. The overall remission frequency was 97.4%, with 92% in remission after the second course. The rate of induction death was 1.3%.

Recent genomic profiling of ALL has identified several genetic alterations associated with a high risk of treatment failure. Deletion or sequence mutation of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS) is associated with a high rate of leukemic relapse, and testing for IKZF1 alterations at diagnosis may aid risk stratification. A subset of B-ALL patients with IKZF1 alterations have a transcriptional profile similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, and these patients commonly have novel rearrangements and mutations resulting in aberrant cytokine receptor signaling and activation of kinase signaling cascades, including rearrangement of CRLF2 and activating mutations of Janus kinases (JAK1 and JAK2).

We have previously shown that a subset of naive CD4(+) T cells, defined by the expression on their surface of a very low density of CD44 (CD44(v.low) cells), can inhibit wasting and wasting-associated lymphopenia in mice with cancer. In this study, we further investigate the properties of CD44(v.low) cells and show that they are significantly more efficient than the remaining naive (CD44(low) or CD44(int)) and memory CD4(+) cell subsets in reconstituting the overall size of the CD4(+) T cell pool, creating a T cell pool with a diverse TCR repertoire, generating regulatory T cells that express forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), and promoting homeostatic equilibrium between naive, memory, and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell numbers. T cell population reconstitution by CD44(v.low) cells is thymus independent. Compared with CD44(int) cells, a higher percentage of CD44(v.low) cells express B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, interleukin-7 receptor, and CD5.

We investigated whether age, race, sex, acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment arm, body mass, serum lipids, albumin and cortisol levels, dexamethasone pharmacokinetics, and genome-wide germline genetic polymorphisms were associated with symptomatic osteonecrosis. Age more than 10 years (odds ratio, = 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-9.2; P = .00001) and more intensive treatment (odds ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9; P = .011) were risk factors and included as covariates in all analyses. Lower albumin (P = .05) and elevated cholesterol (P = .02) associated with symptomatic osteonecrosis, and severe (grade 3 or 4) osteonecrosis was linked to poor dexamethasone clearance (P = .0005). Adjusting for clinical features, polymorphisms of ACP1 (eg, rs12714403, P = 1.9 x 10(-6), odds ratio = 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-11.3), which regulates lipid levels and osteoblast differentiation, were associated with risk of osteonecrosis as well as with lower albumin and higher cholesterol.

This immunologic effect may impair antitumor immune function because cancer complications such as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma are found in patients exposed to asbestos. To elucidate the antitumor immune status caused by CD4(+) T cells exposed to asbestos, an in vitro T-cell model of long-term and low-level exposure to chrysotile asbestos was established from a human adult T-cell leukemia virus-1-immortalized human polyclonal T cell line, MT-2, and the resulting six sublines showed resistance to asbestos-induced apoptosis after more than 8 months of continuous exposure. The results of DNA microarray analysis showed that the expression of 139 genes was altered by long-term and low-level exposure to asbestos, and the profile was almost similar among the six sublines when compared with the original MT-2 cells that had never been exposed to asbestos. Pathway and network analysis indicated a down-regulation of IFN-gamma signaling and expression of CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) in the sublines, whereas ELISA and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a reduction in Th1-related IFN-gamma production and cell-surface CXCR3 expression. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to asbestos may reduce antitumor immune status in CD4(+) T cells, and that an in vitro T-cell model may be useful in identifying molecules related to the impairment of antitumor immune function.",,"['Maeda, Megumi', 'Nishimura, Yasumitsu', 'Hayashi, Hiroaki', 'Kumagai, Naoko', 'Chen, Ying', 'Murakami, Shuko', 'Miura, Yoshie', 'Hiratsuka, Jun-ichi', 'Kishimoto, Takumi', 'Otsuki, Takemi']","['Maeda M', 'Nishimura Y', 'Hayashi H', 'Kumagai N', 'Chen Y', 'Murakami S', 'Miura Y', 'Hiratsuka J', 'Kishimoto T', 'Otsuki T']","['Department of Hygiene, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 MatsushiKurashiki, Okayama 7010192, Japan. mmaeda@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101210,United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '1332-21-4 (Asbestos)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Asbestos/*toxicity', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Mesothelioma/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, CXCR3/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['2010-0213OC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2010-0213OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2011 Sep;45(3):470-9. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2010-0213OC.

The primary endpoint was to determine the disease control rate (DCR) as measured by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (complete response, partial response [PR], and stable disease) at 6 weeks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged >/=18 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2 and with progressive pancreas adenocarcinoma following treatment with gemcitabine were eligible. Sunitinib was dosed at 50 mg orally days 1-28, every 42 days (1 cycle). The statistical plan called for a three-stage design. A DCR >/=15% was considered worthy of further study. RESULTS: In total, 77 patients were enrolled. Forty-two (54.6%) enrollees were male. The median age was 65 years. The ECOG performance status score distribution was: 0, 39%; 1, 50%; 2, 11%. The DCR was 21.6%; one patient (1.4%) had a PR and 15 patients (20.3%) had stable disease as their best response. The progression-free survival time was 1.31 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.38 months) and overall survival time was 3.68 months (95% CI, 3.06-4.24 months). CONCLUSIONS: The study met its primary endpoint; however sunitinib had minimal activity and moderate toxicity in a population of gemcitabine-refractory pancreas adenocarcinoma patients.

Some genetic alterations known to promote cellular proliferation and induce malignant transformation also may participate in an intrinsic inflammatory pathway that produces a cancer-promoting inflammatory microenvironment. Little is known about this intrinsic inflammatory pathway in Barrett's esophagus. We have used a series of nontransformed and transformed human Barrett's epithelial cell lines developed in our laboratory to explore the potential contribution of interleukin (IL)-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) (key molecules in the intrinsic inflammatory pathway) to Barrett's carcinogenesis. We determined IL-6 mRNA expression and protein secretion and protein expression of activated phospho-STAT3 and its downstream target myeloid cell leukemia (mcl)-1 (Mcl-1). We used an IL-6 blocking antibody and two JAK kinase inhibitors (AG490 and JAK inhibitor I) to assess whether STAT3 activation is IL-6 dependent. We also used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to STAT3 and Mcl-1 to assess effects of STAT3 pathway inhibition on apoptosis. Phospho-STAT3 was expressed only by transformed Barrett's cells, which also exhibited higher levels of IL-6 mRNA and of IL-6 and Mcl-1 proteins than nontransformed Barrett's cells. STAT3 phosphorylation could be blocked by IL-6 blocking antibody and by AG490 and JAK inhibitor I. In transformed Barrett's cells, rates of apoptosis following exposure to deoxycholic acid were significantly increased by transfection with siRNAs for STAT3 and Mcl-1. We conclude that activation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in transformed Barrett's epithelial cells enables them to resist apoptosis. These findings demonstrate a possible contribution of the intrinsic inflammatory pathway to carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus.",,"['Zhang, Hui Ying', 'Zhang, Qiuyang', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Yu, Chunhua', 'Huo, Xiaofang', 'Cheng, Edaire', 'Wang, David H', 'Spechler, Stuart J', 'Souza, Rhonda F']","['Zhang HY', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang X', 'Yu C', 'Huo X', 'Cheng E', 'Wang DH', 'Spechler SJ', 'Souza RF']","[""Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System, Children's Hospital, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 DK063621/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA134571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK63621/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101209,United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Although there is no consensus as to the normal cellular counterpart(s) in the disease, an antigen-experienced B lymphocyte appears required based on surface membrane phenotypes and gene expression profiles. However, what is still unclear is whether a single or multiple normal precursors were stimulated to evolve into CLL and at what stage(s) this occurred. A unifying, parsimonious theory is that CLL clones with either mutated or unmutated IGHVs derive from marginal zone B cells. However, evidence for remarkably similar B-cell receptor amino acid sequence and striking differences in polyantigen and autoantigen-binding activity, found in some but not all CLL clones, challenge a single-cell derivation for CLL. In this Perspective, we summarize data regarding normal counterparts of CLL cells and suggest that a multistep process of leukemogenesis is important to consider when assigning a cellular origin for this disease. Finally, although available data do not definitively identify the cell(s) of origin, we offer possibilities for single- and multiple-cell origin models as straw men that can be improved on and hopefully lead to final answers to this puzzle.",,"['Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Chiorazzi N', 'Ferrarini M']","['Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.

Somatic point mutations of the receptor that constitutively activate kit signaling are associated with mastocytosis and various hematopoietic malignancies. We generated a Cre/loxP-based bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model that allows conditional expression of a kit gene carrying the kitD814V mutation (the murine homolog of the most common mutation in human mastocytosis, kitD816V) driven by the kit promoter. Expression of the mutant kit in cells of adult mice, including hematopoietic precursors, caused severe mastocytosis with 100% penetrance at young age frequently associated with additional hematopoietic (mostly B lineage-derived) neoplasms and focal colitis. Restriction of transgene expression to mature mast cells resulted in a similar mast cell disease developing with slower kinetics. Embryonic expression led to a hyperproliferative dysregulation of the erythroid lineage with a high rate of perinatal lethality.

Hcys influences the formation of a stable bone matrix directly through the inhibition of the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase (Lox) and, as we have shown recently, by repressing its mRNA expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in this process. Through evaluation of gene arrays, quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblots, and ELISA, we identified a Hcys-dependent stimulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and genes involved in IL-6/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-dependent signal transduction pathways in pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, up-regulation of genes essential for epigenetic DNA methylation (DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases and helicase lymphoid-specific (Hells) was observed. Further investigations demonstrated that Hcys increased via IL-6/JAK2 the expression of Fli1 (Friend leukemia virus integration 1), a transcription factor, which we found essential for IL-6-dependent Dnmt1 stimulation. CpG methylation analysis of CpG-rich Lox proximal promoter revealed an increased CpG methylation status after treatment of the cells with Hcys indicating an epigenetic origin for Hcys-dependent Lox repression. Inhibition of the IL-6/JAK2 pathway or of CpG methylation reversed the repressive effect of Hcys on Lox expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Hcys stimulates IL-6 synthesis in osteoblasts, which is known to affect bone metabolism via osteoclasts. Furthermore, IL-6 stimulation results via JAK2, Fli1, and Dnmt1 in down-regulation of Lox expression by epigenetic CpG methylation revealing a new mechanism negatively affecting bone matrix formation.",,"['Thaler, Roman', 'Agsten, Marlies', 'Spitzer, Silvia', 'Paschalis, Eleftherios P', 'Karlic, Heidrun', 'Klaushofer, Klaus', 'Varga, Franz']","['Thaler R', 'Agsten M', 'Spitzer S', 'Paschalis EP', 'Karlic H', 'Klaushofer K', 'Varga F']","['1st Medical Department, Hanusch Hospital, Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Osteology, Hanusch Hospital, Wiener Gebietskrankenkasse and AUVA Trauma Center Meidling, 1140 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101209,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '149137-54-2 (Lox protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.4.3.13 (Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.- (Hells protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Homocysteine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3037671,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)52128-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.166181 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Feb 18;286(7):5578-88. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.166181.

This is commonly due to overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Mcl-1, which bind to the BH3 alpha-helical domain of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bim, and inhibit their function. We designed a BH3 alpha-helical mimetic BH3-M6 that binds to Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 and prevents their binding to fluorescently labeled Bak- or Bim-BH3 peptides in vitro. Using several approaches, we demonstrate that BH3-M6 is a pan-Bcl-2 antagonist that inhibits the binding of Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 to multi-domain Bax or Bak, or BH3-only Bim or Bad in cell-free systems and in intact human cancer cells, freeing up pro-apoptotic proteins to induce apoptosis. BH3-M6 disruption of these protein-protein interactions is associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Using caspase inhibitors and Bax and Bak siRNAs, we demonstrate that BH3-M6-induced apoptosis is caspase- and Bax-, but not Bak-dependent. Furthermore, BH3-M6 disrupts Bcl-X(L)/Bim, Bcl-2/Bim, and Mcl-1/Bim protein-protein interactions and frees up Bim to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells that depend for tumor survival on the neutralization of Bim with Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2, or Mcl-1.

Between 1996 and 2009, 651 APL patients with available data on CD56 expression were included in 3 subsequent trials (PETHEMA LPA96 and LPA99 and PETHEMA/HOVON LPA2005). Seventy-two patients (11%) were CD56(+) (expression of CD56 in >/= 20% leukemic promyelocytes). CD56(+) APL was significantly associated with high white blood cell counts; low albumin levels; BCR3 isoform; and the coexpression of CD2, CD34, CD7, HLA-DR, CD15, and CD117 antigens. For CD56(+) APL, the 5-year relapse rate was 22%, compared with a 10% relapse rate for CD56(-) APL (P = .006).

In summary, CD56 expression is associated with the coexpression of immaturity-associated and T-cell antigens and is an independent adverse prognostic factor for relapse in patients with APL treated with all-trans-retinoic acid plus idarubicin-derived regimens. This marker may be considered for implementing risk-adapted therapeutic strategies in APL.

The effect of coadministration of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of bosutinib was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 2-period, crossover study. Healthy subjects (fasting) received a single dose of oral bosutinib 100 mg alone and with multiple once-daily doses of oral ketoconazole 400 mg. PK sampling occurred through 96 hours. The least square geometric mean treatment ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) of C(max(bosutinib+ketoconazole))/C(max(bosutinib alone)), AUC(T(bosutinib+ketoconazole))/AUC(T(bosutinib alone)), and AUC((bosutinib+ketoconazole))/AUC((bosutinib alone)) were assessed. Compared with bosutinib administered alone, coadministration with ketoconazole increased bosutinib C(max) 5.2-fold, AUC(T) 7.6-fold, and AUC 8.6-fold. Ketoconazole coadministration decreased the mean apparent clearance of bosutinib approximately 9-fold and increased the mean (SD) terminal half-life from 46.2 (16.4) hours to 69.0 (29.1) hours. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable between the 2 treatments. The most common AEs were headache, nausea, and increased blood creatinine. No safety-related discontinuations or serious AEs occurred.

Notch1 and Fbw7 mutations both lead the activation of the Notch1 pathway and are found in the majority of patients with the leukemia T-ALL. However, little is known about the mechanisms and regulators that are responsible for attenuating the Notch signaling pathway through Fbw7. Here, we report that the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase SGK1 remarkably reduced the protein stability of the active form of Notch1 through Fbw7. The protein level and transcriptional activity of the Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) were higher in SGK1-deficient cells than in SGK1 wild-type cells. Notch1-IC was able to form a trimeric complex with Fbw7 and SGK1, thereby SGK1 enhanced the protein degradation of Notch1-IC via a Fbw7-dependent proteasomal pathway. Furthermore, activated SGK1 phosphorylated Fbw7 at serine 227, an effect inducing Notch1-IC protein degradation and ubiquitylation. Moreover, accumulated dexamethasone-induced SGK1 facilitated the degradation of Notch1-IC through phosphorylation of Fbw7. Together our results suggest that SGK1 inhibits the Notch1 signaling pathway via phosphorylation of Fbw7.",,"['Mo, Jung-Soon', 'Ann, Eun-Jung', 'Yoon, Ji-Hye', 'Jung, Jane', 'Choi, Yun-Hee', 'Kim, Hwa-Young', 'Ahn, Ji-Seon', 'Kim, Su-Man', 'Kim, Mi-Yeon', 'Hong, Ji-Ae', 'Seo, Mi-Sun', 'Lang, Florian', 'Choi, Eui-Ju', 'Park, Hee-Sae']","['Mo JS', 'Ann EJ', 'Yoon JH', 'Jung J', 'Choi YH', 'Kim HY', 'Ahn JS', 'Kim SM', 'Kim MY', 'Hong JA', 'Seo MS', 'Lang F', 'Choi EJ', 'Park HS']","['Hormone Research Center, School of Biological Sciences and Technology, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101208,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Fbxw7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (serum-glucocorticoid regulated kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Down-Regulation', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Receptor, Notch1/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.073924 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.073924 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Jan 1;124(Pt 1):100-12. doi: 10.1242/jcs.073924.

Previously, we identified genes and pathways associated with exposure to high (> 10 ppm) levels of benzene through transcriptomic analyses of blood cells from a small number of occupationally exposed workers. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to identify potential biomarkers of benzene exposure and/or early effects and to elucidate mechanisms relevant to risk of hematotoxicity, leukemia, and lymphoid malignancy in occupationally exposed individuals, many of whom were exposed to benzene levels < 1 ppm, the current U.S. occupational standard. METHODS: We analyzed global gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 125 workers exposed to benzene levels ranging from < 1 ppm to > 10 ppm. Study design and analysis with a mixed-effects model minimized potential confounding and experimental variability. RESULTS: We observed highly significant widespread perturbation of gene expression at all exposure levels. The AML pathway was among the pathways most significantly associated with benzene exposure. Immune response pathways were associated with most exposure levels, potentially providing biological plausibility for an association between lymphoma and benzene exposure. We identified a 16-gene expression signature associated with all levels of benzene exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that chronic benzene exposure, even at levels below the current U.S. occupational standard, perturbs many genes, biological processes, and pathways. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which benzene may induce hematotoxicity, leukemia, and lymphoma and reveal relevant potential biomarkers associated with a range of exposures.",,"['McHale, Cliona M', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Lan, Qing', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Li, Guilan', 'Hubbard, Alan E', 'Porter, Kristin E', 'Thomas, Reuben', 'Portier, Christopher J', 'Shen, Min', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Rothman, Nathaniel']","['McHale CM', 'Zhang L', 'Lan Q', 'Vermeulen R', 'Li G', 'Hubbard AE', 'Porter KE', 'Thomas R', 'Portier CJ', 'Shen M', 'Rappaport SM', 'Yin S', 'Smith MT', 'Rothman N']","['School of Public Health, University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, California 64720, USA. cmchale@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES006721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES05948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES005948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20101213,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC3094412,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/08/25 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1002546 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2011 May;119(5):628-34. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1002546.

OBJECTIVES: A national registry-based case-control study [ESCALE (Etude Sur les Cancers et les Leucemies de l'Enfant, Study on Environmental and Genetic Risk Factors of Childhood Cancers and Leukemia)] carried out in France was used to assess the effect of exposure to road traffic exhaust fumes on the risk of childhood leukemia. METHODS: Over the study period, 2003-2004, 763 cases and 1,681 controls < 15 years old were included, and the controls were frequency matched with the cases on age and sex. The ESCALE data were collected by a standardized telephone interview of the mothers. Various indicators of exposure to traffic and pollution were determined using the geocoded addresses at the time of diagnosis for the cases and of interview for the controls. Indicators of the distance from, and density of, main roads and traffic nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) concentrations derived from traffic emission data were used. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Acute leukemia (AL) was significantly associated with estimates of traffic NO(2) concentration at the place of residence > 27.7 microg/m(3) compared with NO(2) concentration < 21.9 microg/m(3) [OR=1.2; confidence interval (CI), 1.0-1.5] and with the presence of a heavy-traffic road within 500 m compared with the absence of a heavy-traffic road in the same area (OR=2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-3.6). There was a significant association between AL and a high density of heavy-traffic roads within 500 m compared with the reference category with no heavy-traffic road within 500 m (OR=2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2), with a significant positive linear trend of the association of AL with the total length of heavy-traffic road within 500 m.

In search of new compounds with strong antiproliferative activity and simple molecular structure, a new series of 2-amino-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzoyl)-5-(hetero)aryl ethynyl thiophene derivatives was prepared by the Sonogashira coupling reaction of the corresponding 5-bromothiophenes with several (hetero)aryl acetylenes. When these compounds were analyzed in vitro for their inhibition of cell proliferation, the 2- and 3-thiophenyl acetylene derivatives were the most powerful compounds, both of which exerted cytostatic effects at submicromolar concentrations. In contrast, the presence of a more flexible ethyl chain between the (hetero)aryl and the 5-position of the thiophene ring resulted in significant reduction in activity relative to the 5-(hetero)aryl acetylene substituted derivatives. The effects of a selected series of compounds on cell cycle progression correlated well with their strong antiproliferative activity and inhibition of tubulin polymerization.

Recent studies have pointed out that intrinsic gene susceptibility to DNA methylation, environmental factors and gene function all have an intertwined participation in this process.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in apoptosis control as well as other cellular responses. This study was initially aimed to examine whether p53 was involved in Mcl-1 deficiency-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes. METHODS: Hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1 knockout (Alb-Mcl-1(-/-)) mice and Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) mice in wild-type or p53-deficient background were generated and characterized. RESULTS: Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) mice were viable, but their liver cells were prone to undergo apoptosis and manifested a slightly elevated level of p53. To examine the role of p53 in Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) livers, Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) mice without p53 (DKO mice) were characterized. Unexpectedly, although p53-deficient mice appeared to be developmentally normal, DKO mice were highly susceptible to neonatal death ( approximately 60%). Further analysis revealed that such an early lethality was likely due to hepatic failure caused by a marked reduction of fully-differentiated hepatocytes at the perinatal/neonatal stage. Moreover, those DKO mice that did survive to adulthood manifested more severe liver damage than Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) mice, suggesting that p53 was activated in Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) livers to promote cell survival. Microarray followed by quantitative PCR analysis suggested that p21(Waf1/Cip1), one p53 target gene with apoptosis-inhibitory function, is likely involved in the protective role of p53 in Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) livers. Moreover, we demonstrated that loss of p53 promoted liver fibrosis and tumor development in Alb-Mcl-1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed an unexpected synergism between Mcl-1 and p53 in protecting from hepatic injury, fibrosis, and cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Despite these advances, recurrent and/or relapsing disease remains a major concern. In this respect, new clinical and biological agents have recently been identified, which may allow a better selection for high-risk patients, who could be offered more aggressive therapies including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although autologous transplant does not appear to provide additional benefit in advanced refractory disease, allogeneic transplant may offer a chance for cure. Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant probably has curative potential with a better toxicity profile, and it is actively being investigated.

Increased perioperative rates of infections, thrombo-embolic complications, and bleeding disorders are reported. However, low patient numbers and lack of control groups limit all published studies. METHODS: A total of 56 patients with a history of HM underwent cardiac surgery. As many as 29 patients suffered from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, five from Hodgkin disease, and 12 from myeloproliferative disorders, one from acute lymphatic leukemia, and nine from monoclonal gammopathy. Surgery consisted of coronary artery bypass grafting, valvular surgery or combination procedures. HM patients were matched to 142 controls. Matching criteria applied consisted of sex, age, main diagnosis, and co-morbidities. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was elevated in HM patients though not reaching significance (P = 0.7). HM patients demonstrated increased rates of vascular, pulmonary, infectious complications (P > 0.1), and transfusion requirements (P = 0.077). The long-term survival of HM patients was significantly impaired (P = 0.043). A history of irradiation or chemotherapy predisposed to postoperative respiratory insufficiency, acute renal failure, and an impaired long-term survival (P > 0.065). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery in patients with a history of a malignant hematologic disorder might achieve acceptable results. However, a higher complication and mortality rate have to be anticipated. Patients with hematologic disorders and a history of either irradiation or chemotherapy appear to be at an increased risk to develop postoperative end-organ failure.","['Copyright (c) 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

Annexin II (Ann II) is a co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This study demonstrates that abnormally high levels of Ann II expression in APL cells increase the production of plasmin. Hyperfibrinolysis could be corrected by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or ATRA plus arsenic trioxide therapy in patients with APL. SiRNA targetting Ann II caused a decrease in tPA-dependent plasmin generation, while Ann II cDNA transfectant stimulated plasmin production.

The registration of one's own chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in the TARGET system makes it possible to share experiences among physicians, and, thus, may facilitate appropriate treatment for patients. Patients were registered in the TARGET system from October 2003 to March 2010 in Japan. A total of 1236 patients from 176 hospitals were registered in Japan. We analyzed data from 639 CML chronic phase patients not receiving prior therapy registered in this system. After 90 months follow-up, high survival rates were demonstrated for imatinib-treated newly diagnosed CML patients, with event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates of 79.1, 94.8, and 95.1%, respectively. A landmark analysis of 296 patients who showed a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months after the initiation of imatinib treatment revealed that, at 90 months, 99% of patients (95% CI, 98-100) had not progressed to accelerated phase (AP) or blastic crisis (BC). The patients showing a CCyR and a reduction of at least 3log levels of BCR-ABL transcripts after 18 months of treatment had an estimated survival rate without CML progression of 100% at 84 months. The probability of achieving undetectable BCR-ABL in patients by 72 months with an major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months was 86.5%, compared with 64.7% for those without an MMR (p < 0.0001). There were no new safety issues. In summary, based on this 7-year TARGET analysis, imatinib showed a continual clinical benefit as first-line therapy for newly diagnosed CML.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a dose-escalating study of daunorubicin combined to fixed doses of IM (imatinib mesylate, 600 mg/d) and cytarabine (200 mg/d for 7 days), followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or maintenance therapy with single-agent IM in patients with MBC-CML at onset or after failure of therapy excluding TKIs. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were evaluated. Median follow-up is 6.1 years. Daunorubicin was escaladed up to 45 mg/m(2)/d 3 days. Twenty eight patients (77.7%) had hematologic response including 20 patients (55.5%) in complete hematologic response (CHR). Patients who received daunorubicin at 30-45 mg/m(2)/d had higher CHR rates compared to other patients. Median overall survival was 16 months. Overall survival in patients with hematological response was 35.4 months. Better results were observed in patients diagnosed with MBC-CML at onset. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IM with a standard ""3+7"" regiment was well tolerated and provided a high response rate. More than 55% of the patients achieved CHR and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was feasible in half of the cases.

Mantle cell lymphoma is generally an aggressive B cell lymphoma with a short median survival time, whereas small lymphocytic lymphoma is typically an indolent B cell lymphoma with a prolonged median survival time. Using primary tumor samples in bi-directional suppression subtractive hybridization, we identified genes with differential expression in an aggressive mantle cell lymphoma versus an indolent small lymphocytic lymphoma. ""Virtual"" Northern blot analyses of multiple lymphoma samples confirmed that a set of genes was preferentially expressed in aggressive mantle cell lymphoma compared to indolent small lymphocytic lymphoma. These analyses identified mantle cell lymphoma-specific genes that may be involved in the aggressive behavior of mantle cell lymphoma and possibly other aggressive human lymphomas.

Noxa is constitutively expressed in proliferating cells of hematopoietic lineage and required for apoptosis in response to glucose stress. We show that Noxa is phosphorylated on a serine residue (S(13)) in the presence of glucose. Phosphorylation promotes its cytosolic sequestration and suppresses its apoptotic function. We identify Cdk5 as the Noxa kinase and show that Cdk5 knockdown or expression of a Noxa S(13) to A mutant increases sensitivity to glucose starvation, confirming that the phosphorylation is protective. Both glucose deprivation and Cdk5 inhibition promote apoptosis by dephosphorylating Noxa. Paradoxically, Noxa stimulates glucose consumption and may enhance glucose turnover via the pentose phosphate pathway rather than through glycolysis. We propose that Noxa plays both growth-promoting and proapoptotic roles in hematopoietic cancers with phospho-S(13) as the glucose-sensitive toggle switch controlling these opposing functions.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The present study demonstrates the efficacy of Tregs pharmacologically induced in vivo in GVHD prevention. A single i.v. administration of a liposomal formulation of alpha-galactosylceramide (RGI-2001) at the time of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with spleen cells significantly prolonged the survival of mice experiencing lethal acute GVHD. RGI-2001 expanded donor-derived CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow in a dose-dependent manner. On day 15 posttransplantation, the spleens of mice treated with RGI-2001 (1 mug/kg) contained 5-fold higher percentages or 10-fold higher numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs compared with the spleens of untreated mice. Host-specific immunosuppression was introduced in treated mice, whereas the responsiveness to third-party alloantigens and leukemia cells was maintained. Using Foxp3:GFP reporter mice as donors, it was clearly shown that RGI-2001 expanded the pre-existing naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) in donor spleen cells. Finally, RGI-2001 synergized with a subtherapeutic dose of rapamycin in nTreg expansion and further prolonged survival. Our results provide the first demonstration of the efficacy of nTregs pharmacologically expanded in vivo in preventing acute GVHD without abrogation of the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nowadays methadone is also being applied as long-lasting analgesics in cancer, and it is proposed as a promising agent for leukemia therapy. Previously, we have demonstrated that high concentrations of methadone (0.5mM) induced necrotic-like cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. The pathway involved is caspase-independent but involves impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. However, the downstream mitochondrial pathways remained unclear. Here, we studied the participation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) in methadone-induced cell death. Methadone resulted in a translocation of AIF from mitochondria to the nucleus. Translocation was inhibited by cyclosporine A, but not by lack of Bax protein. Therefore the effect seems mediated by the formation of the mitochondrial transition pore, but is apparently independent of Bax. Furthermore, methadone-treated SH-SY5Y nuclei show characteristics that are typical for stage I nuclear condensation. Methadone did not induce degradation of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments or into high molecular weight DNA fragments. Absence of DNA fragmentation coincided with a considerable decrease in the levels of the caspase-actived endonuclase DNase and its chaperone-inhibitor ICAD. In conclusion, our results provide mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie methadone-induced cell death. This knowledge may prove useful to develop novel strategies to prevent toxic side-effects of methadone thereby sustaining its use as therapeutical agent against tumors.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Although BZ, TOL, and o-XY have been shown to induce apoptosis in vitro, their mechanism of toxicity remains unclear. In this study, we sought to identify the apoptotic pathway(s) activated by BZ, TOL, and o-XY in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometric analyses of Annexin V/PI double-stained cells revealed similar patterns of apoptosis following BZ, TOL, and o-XY exposure. Though reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contributes significantly to BZ metabolite-induced apoptotic cell death, we hypothesized that BZ, TOL, and o-XY can themselves trigger ROS production, leading to the activation of apoptotic signaling. Dose-dependent increases in ROS production and significant tail moments were observed in HL-60 cells exposed to all three compounds. Real-time RT-PCR revealed increased HMOX1 and Noxa expression in BZ-, TOL-, and o-XY-treated HL-60 cells, confirming the results of previous microarray analyses. Similar expression profiles were found in human K562 erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cells and human U937 leukemic monocyte lymphoma cells. Pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine decreased the effects of exposure to BZ, TOL, and o-XY.

Previous studies of the regulation of human ABO gene transcription have focused mainly on the 5' region, including the core promoter and the region proximal to it. However, as the involvement of the 3' flanking region in transcriptional regulation has not yet been examined, we focused on this issue. The 3' region approximately 2.2kb downstream of the ABO gene was PCR-amplified and inserted into a cloning vector, followed by sequence determination and preparation of luciferase reporter vectors. Transient transfections into KATOIII and K562 cells were performed using various reporter plasmids containing the 3' region. The 3' region of the ABO gene, which was characterized by a high degree of sequence repetition, was effectively cloned by a single-copy cloning method. Transfections in KATOIII and K562 cells showed that negative elements were demonstrable within the 3' region. These observations suggest that negative regulatory elements seem to be present in the 3' region of ABO in both epithelial and erythroid lineages. As we had observed a negative region just upstream of the ABO promoter, transcription from ABO could be negatively regulated by repressive regions just upstream of the promoter and downstream of the gene.

In addition, lipid droplets can be induced in HPB-AML-I cells by methylisobutylxanthine, hydrocortisone, and indomethacin. These findings suggest that HPB-AML-I is similar to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or mesenchymal stromal cells rather than to hematopoietic cells. METHODS: To examine this possibility, we characterized HPB-AML-I by performing cytochemical, cytogenetic, and phenotypic analyses, induction of differentiation toward mesenchymal lineage cells, and mixed lymphocyte culture analysis. RESULTS: HPB-AML-I proved to be negative for myeloperoxidase, while surface antigen analysis disclosed that it was positive for MSC-related antigens, such as CD29, CD44, CD55, CD59, and CD73, but not for CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, CD90, CD105, CD117, and HLA-DR. Karyotypic analysis showed the presence of complicated abnormalities, but no reciprocal translocations typically detected in AML cases. Following the induction of differentiation toward adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes, HPB-AML-I cells showed, in conjunction with extracellular matrix formation, lipid accumulation, proteoglycan synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase expression. Mixed lymphocyte culture demonstrated that CD3+ T-cell proliferation was suppressed in the presence of HPB-AML-I cells.

Thus, non-culture-based methods for diagnosing IC have been developed. Mannan antigen (Mn) and anti-mannan antibodies (A-Mn) are present in patients with IC. On behalf of the Third European Conference on Infections in Leukemia, the performance of these tests was analysed and reviewed. METHODS: The literature was searched for studies using the commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Platelia, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) for detecting Mn and A-Mn in serum. The target condition of this review was IC defined according to 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated for Mn, A-Mn and combined Mn/A-Mn testing. RESULTS: Overall, 14 studies that comprised 453 patients and 767 controls were reviewed. The patient populations included in the studies were mainly haematological and cancer cases in seven studies and mainly intensive care unit and surgery cases in the other seven studies. All studies but one were retrospective in design. Mn sensitivity was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53-62); specificity, 93% (95% CI, 91-94) and DOR, 18 (95% CI 12-28). A-Mn sensitivity was 59% (95% CI, 54-65); specificity, 83% (95% CI, 79-97) and DOR, 12 (95% CI 7-21). Combined Mn/A-Mn sensitivity was 83% (95% CI, 79-87); specificity, 86% (95% CI, 82-90) and DOR, 58 (95% CI 27-122). Significant heterogeneity of the studies was detected. The sensitivity of both Mn and A-Mn varied for different Candida species, and it was the highest for C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata and C. tropicalis. In 73% of 45 patients with candidemia, at least one of the serological tests was positive before the culture results, with mean time advantage being 6 days for Mn and 7 days for A-Mn. In 21 patients with hepatosplenic IC, 18 (86%) had Mn or A-Mn positive test results at a median of 16 days before radiological detection of liver or spleen lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Mn and A-Mn are useful for diagnosis of IC. The performance of combined Mn/A-Mn testing is superior to either Mn or A-Mn testing.",,"['Mikulska, Malgorzata', 'Calandra, Thierry', 'Sanguinetti, Maurizio', 'Poulain, Daniel', 'Viscoli, Claudio']","['Mikulska M', 'Calandra T', 'Sanguinetti M', 'Poulain D', 'Viscoli C']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, San Martino University Hospital, L,go R, Benzi, 10, Genoa, Italy. m_mikulska@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20101208,England,Crit Care,"Critical care (London, England)",9801902,"['0 (Antibodies, Fungal)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Mannans)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Fungal/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Fungal/*immunology', 'Candida/*immunology', 'Candidiasis, Invasive/diagnosis/immunology/*microbiology', '*Congresses as Topic', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/immunology/*microbiology', 'Mannans/*immunology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/standards']",PMC3219989,2010/12/15 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['cc9365 [pii]', '10.1186/cc9365 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Care. 2010;14(6):R222. doi: 10.1186/cc9365.

CBC abnormalities included marked leukocytosis (106,000/muL), marked monocytosis (78,000/muL), and the presence of 13% blast cells (13,832/muL), supporting a diagnosis of leukemia. Cytopenias and dysplastic changes in other cell lines were not present. Microscopic examination of bone marrow showed hypercellular uniparticles with a marginal increase in frequency of unclassified blast cells (2%), but was otherwise unremarkable. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of blood cells determined that leukemic cells were CD45(+) , CD14(+) , and CD34(-) , and based on side scatter and CD45 reactivity the marrow contained 19% monoblasts. By immunocytochemical staining, the leukemic cells in the bone marrow were CD11b(+) , CD11c(+) , CD11d(+) , MHC-II(+) , MPO(+) , and CD34(-) . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes documented a chromosomal translocation producing a BCR-ABL gene hybrid, similar to the ""Philadelphia"" chromosome abnormality recognized in human chronic myelogenous leukemia, as well as a phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene deletion. Hydroxyurea therapy was attempted, but was ineffective; the dog died 7 months after initial presentation. Clinical and laboratory findings and the protracted course supported a diagnosis of chronic monocytic leukemia (CMoL) and, to our knowledge, this is the first case of CMoL with a BCR-ABL chromosomal abnormalitiy described in dogs.

We compared aCGH with routine cytogenetics and FISH in detecting genetic alterations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridization testing was performed on 55 cases of CLL in addition to a standard panel of FISH probes (ATM on 11q22, trisomy 12, 13q14, p53 on 17p13). The frequency of detecting abnormalities was compared, and discordant results between methodologies were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-five CLL cases [male to female ratio of 2.2:1 and a mean age of 71 (52-90)] were analyzed by both aCGH and FISH. This group of CLL cases showed genetic abnormalities by FISH (60%; 27/45). In contrast to FISH, aCGH detected genetic abnormalities in 82% (45/55) of CLL cases; aCGH identified genetic abnormalities not detected by FISH studies in 16% (7/45) of cases, whereas FISH identified abnormalities not detected by aCGH in only 7% (3/45) of cases. Rare recurring genetic alterations were detected by aCGH including losses in 6q, 8p, 10q, 14q32, and 18q and gains in 10q. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest aCGH is an effective technique for evaluating recurring genetic abnormalities in CLL and improves on standard FISH in detecting genetic abnormalities in CLL.",['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"[""O'Malley, D P"", 'Giudice, C', 'Chang, A S', 'Chang, D', 'Barry, T S', 'Hibbard, M K', 'Chen, R', 'Chen, S-T']","[""O'Malley DP"", 'Giudice C', 'Chang AS', 'Chang D', 'Barry TS', 'Hibbard MK', 'Chen R', 'Chen ST']","['Clarient, Inc., Columbia, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656-1460, USA. domalley@clarientinc.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20101209,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01284.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Jun;33(3):238-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01284.x.

OBJECTIVE: To construct a plasmid for the expression of human monoclonal IgE antibodies of any desired specificity and to express IgE specific for the major timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 5. METHODS: In a first step, the DNA sequence coding for the IgG(1) heavy chain was excised and replaced by the sequence coding for the human varepsilon constant region gene in plasmid pLNOH2 expressing a human Phl p 5-specific IgG(1) heavy chain. Then, this construct together with a second plasmid expressing the corresponding Phl p 5-specific light chain was co-expressed in COS-7 cells. The Phl p 5-specific IgE (rhuMabEP5) was analysed for allergen-specificity and isotype by ELISA. Cross-reactivity of rhuMabEP5 was investigated by immunoblotting using pollen extracts from various grass species. The allergenic activity of Phl p 5 was studied by exposing rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) cells expressing human-FcvarepsilonRI to rhuMabEP5 and Phl p 5. RESULTS: We report the construction of vector pLNOH2-P5IgE, for the expression of human IgE and exemplify its usefulness by the production of a complete and functional human monoclonal IgE (rhuMabEP5). rhuMabEP5 is specific for the grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 and cross-reacts with group 5 allergens in natural grass pollen extracts. RBL-release assays with rhuMabEP5 demonstrated that oligomerization does not contribute to the high allergenic activity of Phl p 5. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Plasmid pLNOH2-P5IgE allowed the production of a fully functional human monoclonal IgE antibody specific for Phl p 5.

Mothers completed measures of their own well-being. Clinical outcome data were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Children in the HSCT group had significantly more late effects and had received more tests for vision, bone, dental and skin health, and thyroid, lung, and gonadal function than the non-transplanted group. HRQOL scores for the HSCT group were significantly lower in all domains compared with the non-transplanted group and population norms, but were not significantly related to clinical indices. Mothers in the HSCT group had significantly poorer mental well-being than population norms. CONCLUSION: Significant morbidity and compromised HRQOL was found in survivors of HSCT.

Nevertheless, the development of photochemotherapy in oncology remains limited, because of the low selectivity of PSs. In order to allow PS targeting toward tumor-associated antigens, for the first time a white-light activatable porphyrin, [5-(4-(5-carboxy-1-butoxy)-phenyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-N-methyl)-pyridiniumyl)-porphy rin] (TrMPyP) was covalently linked to Morniga G (MorG), a galactose-specific binding plant lectin, known to recognize with high-affinity tumor-associated T/Tn antigen in cell-free systems. Firstly, using fluorescein-labeled MorG, the sugar-dependent binding and uptake of lectin by Tn-positive (Jurkat lymphoid leukemia) cells was demonstrated. Secondly, the TrMPyP-MorG conjugate was molecularly characterized. Cytometric and confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that PS covalent linking to MorG preserved sugar-dependent specific binding and uptake of lectin by Jurkat leukemia lymphocytes. Thirdly, the conjugate (with a 1:1 PS:lectin ratio) that was bound and quickly (5 min) taken-up, induced greater than 90% cytotoxicity upon irradiation at 10 nm concentration, whereas the free PS was absolutely nontoxic.

Adhesion capacity to bone marrow stroma was impaired for leukaemia cells, suggesting that a breakdown of adhesive mechanisms governed by an adhesion molecule may exist in leukaemic microenvironment. We previously found that E-cadherin was low expressed in primary acute leukaemia cells compared with normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. In this study, we investigate the functional importance of low E-cadherin expression in leukaemia cell behaviours and investigate its effects in the abnormal interaction of leukaemic cells with stromal cells. After expression of E-cadherin was restored by a demethylating agent in leukaemia cells, E-cadherin-specific adhesion was enhanced. Additionally, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated silencing of E-cadherin in Raji cells resulted in a reduction of cell homophilic adhesion and enhancement of cell proliferation and colony formation. These results suggest that low expression of E-cadherin contributes to the vigorous growth and transforming ability of leukaemic cells.",,"['Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Ji-Ying', 'Meng, Jihong', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Wang, Yanzhong', 'Wang, Min', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Rao Q', 'Wang JY', 'Meng J', 'Tang K', 'Wang Y', 'Wang M', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, Peoples Republic of China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cadherins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/metabolism']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20100456 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20100456 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2011 Sep;35(9):945-51. doi: 10.1042/CBI20100456.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several clinical trials showed a survival advantage for patients treated with IFN-alpha compared to conventional chemotherapy. Some patients achieved longstanding complete cytogenetic remissions (i.e. >2 log tumor mass reduction). IFN-alpha was then recommended as first line medical treatment until 2001. The mechanism of this anti-leukemic effect is not clear, although IFN-alpha has many effects of potential relevance on stem cells and immunology. There is no evidence of benefit for high dose (in practice a maximally tolerated dose) compared with lower dose IFN-alpha. When IFN-alpha is combined with other drugs, we advice lower dose IFN to minimize toxicity and increase treatment adherence and duration. IFN-alpha combined with Ara-C moderately improves treatment outcome. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is now first line treatment for CML, but two large randomized studies show improved outcome when pegylated IFN-alpha is added to the treatment with imatinib. One explanation for this might be that IFN-alpha, contrary to imatinib, stimulates the quiescent stem cells to proliferate and thereby potentially increases sensitivity to imatinib. Although imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are very efficient, they are rarely curative. IFN-alpha could be included in curatively aimed combination treatment protocols and thus still be an important element in CML treatment.",,"['Simonsson, Bengt', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis', 'Porkka, Kimmo']","['Simonsson B', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Porkka K']","['Department of Hematology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden. bengt.simonsson@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00204 [pii]', '10.2174/138945011794815301 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2011 Mar 1;12(3):420-8. doi: 10.2174/138945011794815301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Status and perspectives.,392-419,,"The Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms encompass essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). A major break-through in the understanding of the pathogenesis of these neoplasms occurred in 2005 by the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation in the large majority of patients with PV and in half of those with ET and PMF. A number of studies have shown that the ""tumor burden"" may be monitored at the molecular level in JAK2-positive patients using highly sensitive real-time quantitative PCR. During the last 25 years several studies have shown that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) induces complete haematological remissions in a large proportion of the patients. However, its use in clinical practice has unfortunately been limited due to side effects with high drop-out rates in most studies. Recently, IFN-alpha2 has been shown to induce deep molecular remissions and also normalization of the bone marrow in PV, which may be sustained even after discontinuation of IFN-alpha2 therapy. Accordingly, in the coming years we are most likely facing a new era of increasing interest for using IFN-alpha2 in the treatment of patients with PV, ET and the hyperproliferative phase of PMF. This paper reviews the history of IFN - in principle IFN-alpha2 - and its present status in the treatment of PV and related diseases. The role of IFN-alpha2 as immune therapy in the future treatment of CMPNs is highlighted and the rationale for the concept of minimal residual disease and potentially cure after long-term immune therapy with IFN-alpha2 is discussed and foreseen as an achievable goal in the future.",,"['Hasselbalch, Hans Carl', 'Larsen, Thomas Stauffer', 'Riley, Caroline Hasselbalch', 'Jensen, Morten Krogh', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques']","['Hasselbalch HC', 'Larsen TS', 'Riley CH', 'Jensen MK', 'Kiladjian JJ']","['Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Roskilde Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark. hasselbalch@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy/metabolism']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00205 [pii]', '10.2174/138945011794815275 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2011 Mar 1;12(3):392-419. doi: 10.2174/138945011794815275.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A one-arm open trial pilot study of an original executive function cognitive rehabilitation curriculum was conducted with 23 paediatric cancer survivors aged 7-19. RESULTS: Compliance with the cognitive rehabilitation program was 83%, similar to that of many traditional programs. Following the cognitive intervention, participants showed significantly increased processing speed, cognitive flexibility, verbal and visual declarative memory scores as well as significantly increased pre-frontal cortex activation compared to baseline.

Our aim was to share with other labs a strategy/algorithm that we find highly useful for implementation to best detect all bcr-abl fusion transcripts for proper patient management. METHODS: We have used two techniques for the detection of bcr-abl transcripts, an in-house developed polymerase chain reaction and a real-time quantitative commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit and tested 849 patients referred for initial screening for bcr-abl. RESULTS: Out of 849 cases, 146 (17.2%) were positive for bcr-abl. Around 92.11% of the total bcr-abl positive cases (N=76) detected by the real-time quantitative technique were also positive by the gel-based PCR assay; however, six cases (around 7.89%) were missed by the real-time assay and detected by the other technique in chronic myelogenous leukemia-proven cases. CONCLUSION: We highly encourage other laboratories to perform testing using a simple and inexpensive gel-based PCR screening assay followed by a real-time quantitative assay for a baseline bcr-abl expression level.

Because cure rates of up to 80 - 90% have been reported using various combinations of the above agents, future strategies will probably aim at reducing therapy-related toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a calicheamicin-conjugated mAb directed against CD33, a surface antigen highly expressed on APL blasts. GO has been shown to be effective in this disease and better tolerated than conventional chemotherapy. AREAS COVERED: This review looks at the mechanism of action, pathways associated with resistance and toxicity profile of GO. Reported experience on the use of GO for relapsed or newly diagnosed APL is also discussed along with evidence on its efficacy and relative tolerability in APL management. In addition to its activity in advanced disease, data suggest that GO in various combinations may replace chemotherapy in APL front-line therapy. This should apply in particular to some subsets such as elderly patients or those unfit to receive conventional chemotherapy.

We conducted an open-label, randomized phase II clinical study to assess the outcome of MSC coinfusion (3-5 x 10(5) cells/kg) during haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. From June 2007 to June 2008, a total of 55 patients who were diagnosed with leukemia in complete remission entered the study (27 in the treatment group and 28 in the control group). No immediate or long-term toxic side effects related to MSC infusion were noted, and the median times of white blood cell and platelet engraftment were comparable between the 2 groups. However, within 100 days, the time to a platelet concentration of >50 x 10(9) cells/L was markedly faster in the treatment group compared with the control group (22 days vs. 28 days; P = 0.036). Stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) reached a peak concentration more rapidly in the treatment group compared with the control group (8th vs. 16th day). The concentrations of SDF-1alpha, thrombopoietin (TPO), and interleukin-11 were also elevated in the MSC-treated group compared with the control group.

It has recently been suggested that, in the UK, we should assume that real drug prices decrease at 4% per annum and, in New Zealand, that real drug prices decrease at 2% per annum and at patent expiry the drug price falls. It has also recently been suggested that we should model multiple future incident cohorts. In this article, the cost effectiveness of drugs is modelled based on these ideas. Algebraic expressions are developed to capture all costs and benefits over the entire life cycle of a new drug. The lifetime of a new drug in the UK, a key model parameter, is estimated as 33 years, based on the historical lifetime of drugs in England over the last 27 years. Under the proposed methodology, cost effectiveness is calculated for seven new drugs recently appraised in the UK. Cost effectiveness as assessed in the future is also estimated. Whilst the article is framed in mathematics, the findings and recommendations are also explained in non-mathematical language. The 'life-cycle correction factor' is introduced, which is used to convert estimates of cost effectiveness as traditionally calculated into estimates under the proposed methodology. Under the proposed methodology, all seven drugs appear far more cost effective in the UK than published. For example, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreases by 46%, from pound61, 900 to pound33, 500 per QALY, for cinacalcet versus best supportive care for end-stage renal disease, and by 45%, from pound31,100 to pound17,000 per QALY, for imatinib versus interferon-alpha for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Assuming real drug prices decrease over time, the chance that a drug is publicly funded increases over time, and is greater when modelling multiple cohorts than with a single cohort. Using the methodology (compared with traditional methodology) all drugs in the UK and New Zealand are predicted to be more cost effective. It is suggested that the willingness-to-pay threshold should be reduced in the UK and New Zealand. The ranking of cost effectiveness will change with drugs assessed as relatively more cost effective and medical devices and surgical procedures relatively less cost effective than previously thought. The methodology is very simple to implement. It is suggested that the model should be parameterized for other countries.",,"['Hoyle, Martin']",['Hoyle M'],"['Peninsula Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK. martin.hoyle@pms.ac.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs/*trends', 'Humans', 'United Kingdom']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/03/19 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1 [pii]', '10.2165/11584230-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2011 Jan;29(1):1-15. doi: 10.2165/11584230-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we showed that NVP-ADW742, a novel small weight molecular inhibitor of IGF-IR, could induce apoptosis in both HL-60 cell line and primary AML blasts. However, no significant alteration of cell cycle was observed in HL-60 cells. Further studies revealed that NVP-ADW742 induced Akt dephosphorylation, which might subsequently induce p38 phosphorylation and decrease antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in HL-60 cells.

Clinical and experimental evidences suggest that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the product of several functionally cooperating genetic alterations including chromosomal translocations leading to expression of leukemogenic fusion proteins. Several AML-associated lesions target chromatin regulators like histone methyltransferases or histone acetyltransferases, including mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) or CREB bindung protein/p300. Molecular and biochemical studies start to provide useful insights into the mechanisms of targeting and mode-of-action of such leukemogenic fusion proteins resulting in aberrant gene expression programs and AML. Chromatin modulating mechanisms are also mediating the transforming activity of key drivers of leukemogenesis by aberrant recruitment of corepressors. Recent large-scale screening efforts demonstrated that both aberrant DNA promoter methylation and aberrantly expressed microRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of AML as well. Current efforts to therapeutically exploit the potential reversibility of epigenetic mechanisms are focused on small molecules that inhibit DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases. Several phase I/II clinical trials using such compounds have reported promising, but mostly transient, clinical responses. This underscores the need to further dissect the molecular players of epigenetic mechanisms driving induction, maintenance, and potential reversibility of leukemic state to develop efficient and long-lasting targeted therapeutic strategies.",,"['Peters, Antoine H F M', 'Schwaller, Juerg']","['Peters AH', 'Schwaller J']","['Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland. antoine.peters@fmi.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Prog Drug Res,Progress in drug research.

Only few chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with multiple serum paraproteins are reported in the literature. METHODS: In this case report we present a 71-year-old woman with CLL and serum MCs. Immunofixation was performed on agarose film using anti-sera monospecific for the heavy and light chains of human immunoglobulins (anti-gamma, -alpha, -mu, -delta, -epsilon, -kappa, -lambda). Serum free light chains (FLCs) were quantified nephelometrically. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using fluorochrome-conjugated goat antibodies specific for human mu, gamma or alpha immunoglobulin heavy chains and K or lamda light chains. RESULTS: Immunofixation revealed two different MCs (IgGlambda + lambda light-chains) in the serum and only one MC (lambda light chains) in concentrated urine. Serum lamda FLCs were 206 mg/L. The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed a 38 % interstitial and nodular infiltration of mature small lymphocytes expressing IgG lambda surface immunoglobulins CD 19, CD20, CD5, and CD23, with negative BCL-1, t(11, 14) and cyclin D1. The plasma cells were less than 1%. Final diagnosis was CLL (Rai stage I) with IgG lamda plus lamda serum paraproteins. Three years later, the patient died because of myocardial infarction after a follow-up period with no need for CLL therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis is that the double MC may be the result of an unbalanced immunoglobulin chain synthesis by the leukemic B-cell clone, resulting in IgGlamda and excess of lambda FLCs.",,"['Guastafierro, Salvatore', 'Celentano, Maria', 'Cuomo, Cristina', 'Falcone, Umberto']","['Guastafierro S', 'Celentano M', 'Cuomo C', 'Falcone U']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Paraproteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood/urine', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*blood/urine', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/urine', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Paraproteinemias/*blood/urine', 'Paraproteins/*analysis/urine']",,2010/12/15 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/12/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab. 2010;56(11-12):577-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, MCL-1 degradation is an early event not only following induction of apoptosis, but also under nutrient deprivation conditions where MCL-1 levels regulate activation of autophagy. Furthermore, deletion of MCL-1 in cortical neurons of transgenic mice activates a robust autophagic response.

Percentage of blast cells in marrow is used to separate acute (rapid) from chronic (gradual) and is the most consistently applied prognostic marker in veterinary medicine. However, since there is marked variation in tumor progression within groups, there is a need for more complex schemes to stratify animals into specific risk groups. In people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pretreatment karyotyping and molecular genetic analysis have greater utility as prognostic markers than morphologic and immunologic phenotypes. Karyotyping is not available as a prognostic marker for AML in dogs and cats, but progress in molecular genetics has created optimism about the eventual ability of veterinarians to discern conditions potentially responsive to medical intervention. In people with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), detailed prognostic scoring systems have been devised that use various combinations of blast cell percentage, hematocrit, platelet counts, unilineal versus multilineal cytopenias and dysplasia, karyotype, gender, age, immunophenotype, transfusion dependence, and colony-forming assays. Predictors of outcome for animals with MDS have been limited to blast cell percentage, anemia versus multilineal cytopenias, and morphologic phenotype. Prognostic markers for myeloproliferative neoplasms (eg, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia) include clinical and hematological factors and in people also include cytogenetics and molecular genetics. Validation of prognostic markers for myeloid neoplasms in animals has been thwarted by the lack of a large case series that requires cooperation across institutions and veterinary specialties.

Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger transcription factors, plays an important role in the control of mature B lymphocyte differentiation and maturation. In this study, we showed that Aiolos expression is up-regulated in B-CLL cells. This overexpression does not implicate isoform imbalance or disturb Aiolos subcellular localization. The chromatin status at the Aiolos promoter in CLL is defined by the demethylation of DNA and an enrichment of euchromatin associated histone markers, such as the dimethylation of the lysine 4 on histone H3. These epigenetic modifications should allow its upstream effectors, such as nuclear factor-kappaB, constitutively activated in CLL, to gain access to promoter, resulting up-regulation of Aiolos. To determine the consequences of Aiolos deregulation in CLL, we analyzed the effects of Aiolos overexpression or down-regulation on apoptosis. Aiolos is involved in cell survival by regulating the expression of some Bcl-2 family members.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Leukemia cells were treated with quercetin, after which apoptosis, Mcl-1 expression, and Bax activation and translocation were evaluated. The efficacy of quercetin as well as Mcl-1 expression and Bax activation were investigated in xenografts of U937 cells. RESULTS: Administration of quercetin caused pronounced apoptosis in both transformed and primary leukemia cells but not in normal blood peripheral mononuclear cells. Quercetin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by Mcl-1 downregulation and Bax conformational change and mitochondrial translocation that triggered cytochrome c release. Knockdown of Bax by siRNA reversed quercetin-induced apoptosis and abrogated the activation of caspase and apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 attenuated quercetin-mediated Bax activation, translocation, and cell death. Conversely, interruption of Mcl-1 by siRNA enhanced Bax activation and translocation, as well as lethality induced by quercetin. However, the absence of Bax had no effect on quercetin-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation. Furthermore, in vivo administration of quercetin attenuated tumor growth in U937 xenografts. The TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in tumor sections increased in quercetin-treated mice as compared with controls. Mcl-1 downregulation and Bax activation were also observed in xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that quercetin may be useful for the treatment of leukemia by preferentially inducing apoptosis in leukemia versus normal hematopoietic cells through a process involving Mcl-1 downregulation, which, in turn, potentiates Bax activation and mitochondrial translocation, culminating in apoptosis.",['(c)2010 AACR.'],"['Cheng, Senping', 'Gao, Ning', 'Zhang, Zhuo', 'Chen, Gang', 'Budhraja, Amit', 'Ke, Zunji', 'Son, Young-ok', 'Wang, Xin', 'Luo, Jia', 'Shi, Xianglin']","['Cheng S', 'Gao N', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen G', 'Budhraja A', 'Ke Z', 'Son YO', 'Wang X', 'Luo J', 'Shi X']","['Graduate Center for Toxicology, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 ES015375/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES015375-06/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism/physiology']",PMC3069720,2010/12/09 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2010/12/09 06:00'],"['2010/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['16/23/5679 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1565 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Dec 1;16(23):5679-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1565.,,['NIHMS246540'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding CXCL12 to CXCR4 activates a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate cell chemotaxis, adhesion, survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we demonstrate that the CXCR4 antagonist, 4F-benzoyl-TN14003 (BKT140), but not AMD3100, exhibits a CXCR4-dependent preferential cytotoxicity toward malignant cells of hematopoietic origin. BKT140 significantly and preferentially stimulated multiple myeloma apoptotic cell death. BKT140 treatment induced morphological changes, phosphatidylserine externalization, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, sub-G1 arrest, and DNA double-stranded breaks. RESULTS: In vivo, subcutaneous injections of BKT140 significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the growth of human acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma xenografts. Tumors from animals treated with BKT140 were smaller in size and weights, had larger necrotic areas and high apoptotic scores. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest a potential therapeutic use for BKT140 in multiple myeloma and leukemia patients.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has developed as an adjunct to or replacement for conventional chemotherapy with the aim of improving survival and quality of life. OBJECTIVES: A systematic overview of the best available evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SCT in the treatment of acute leukaemia. DATA SOURCES: Clinical effectiveness: electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, were searched from inception to December 2008 to identify published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index (SCI) were searched from 1997 to March 2009 to identify primary studies. Cost-effectiveness: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) were searched from inception to January 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Potentially relevant papers were retrieved and independently checked against predefined criteria by two reviewers (one in the case of the cost-effectiveness review). STUDY APPRAISAL: Included reviews and meta-analyses were critically appraised and data extracted and narratively presented. Included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and donor versus no donor (DvND) studies were mapped to the evidence covered in existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses according to a framework of 12 decision problems (DPs): DP1 related to SCT in adults with AML in first complete remission (CR1); DP2 to adults with AML in second or subsequent remission or with refractory disease (CR2+); DP3 to children with AML in CR1; DP4 to children with AML in CR2+; DP5 to adults with ALL in CR1; DP6 to adults with ALL in CR2+; DP7 to children with ALL in CR1; DP8 to children with ALL in CR2+; DP9 to comparison of different sources of stem cells in transplantation; DP10 to different conditioning regimens; DP11 to the use of purging in autologous SCT; and DP12 to the use of T-cell depletion in allogeneic SCT. RESULTS: Fifteen systematic reviews/meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria for the review of clinical effectiveness, thirteen of which were published from 2004 onwards. Taking into account the timing of their publications, most reviews appeared to have omitted an appreciable proportion of potentially available evidence. The best available evidence for effectiveness of allogeneic SCT using stem cells from matched sibling donors came from DvND studies: there was sufficient evidence to support the use of allogeneic SCT in DP1 (except in good-risk patients), DP3 (role of risk stratification unclear) and DP5 (role of risk stratification unclear). There was conflicting evidence in DP7 and a paucity of evidence from DvND studies for all decision problems concerning patient groups in CR2+. The best available evidence for effectiveness of autologous SCT came from RCTs: overall, evidence suggested that autologous SCT was either similar to or less effective than chemotherapy. There was a paucity of evidence from published reviews of RCTs for DPs 9-12. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria in the cost-effectiveness review, most reporting only cost information and only one incorporating an economic model. Although there is a wealth of information on costs and some information on cost-effectiveness of allogeneic SCT in adults with AML (DPs 1 and 2), there is very limited evidence on relative costs and cost-effectiveness for other DPs. LIMITATIONS: Time and resources did not permit critical appraisal of the primary studies on which the reviews/meta-analyses reviewed were based; there were substantial differences in methodologies, and consequently quantitative synthesis of data was neither planned in the protocol nor carried out; some of the studies were quite old and might not reflect current practice; and a number of the studies might not be applicable to the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Bearing in mind the limitations, existing evidence suggests that sibling donor allogeneic SCT may be more effective than chemotherapy in adult AML (except in good-risk patients) in CR1, childhood AML in CR1 and adult ALL in CR1, and that autologous SCT is equal to or less effective than chemotherapy. No firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the cost-effectiveness of SCT in the UK NHS owing to the limitations given above. Future research should include the impact of the treatments on patients' quality of life as well as information on health service use and costs associated with SCT from the perspective of the UK NHS.",,"['Ashfaq, K', 'Yahaya, I', 'Hyde, C', 'Andronis, L', 'Barton, P', 'Bayliss, S', 'Chen, Y-F']","['Ashfaq K', 'Yahaya I', 'Hyde C', 'Andronis L', 'Barton P', 'Bayliss S', 'Chen YF']","['West Midlands Health Technology Assessment Collaboration, Public Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit, School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/economics/*surgery']",,2010/12/09 06:00,2011/03/31 06:00,['2010/12/09 06:00'],"['2010/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3310/hta14540 [doi]'],ppublish,"Health Technol Assess. 2010 Dec;14(54):iii-iv, ix-xi, 1-141. doi: 10.3310/hta14540.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this study, RNA in nucleoli was visualized by a simple but sensitive cytochemical procedure in unfixed cytospins of short-term bone marrow cultures from patients suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia. Valproic acid in leukaemic myeloblasts markedly reduced the nucleolar size and also produced significant transformation of ""active"" to ""resting"" and ""inactive"" nucleoli that reflected the alteration of the nucleolar transcription in sensitive myeloblasts. On this occasion it should be added that valproic acid significantly increased the incidence of altered myeloblasts that changed to apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies and cell ghosts. In contrast to the above-mentioned decreased nucleolar size, the nucleolar RNA concentration, expressed by computerassisted RNA image densitometry in valproic acidtreated myeloblasts, was not significantly changed.

Gleevec (Imatinib mesylate) is a selective inhibitor of this kinase. Treatment with this agent is known to result in hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses. Patan hospital (Patan, Nepal) is one of the Gleevec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) centers for patients with CML. METHODS: A total of 106 Philadelphia positive CML patients were enrolled in our center between Feb 2003 and Jun 2008, and 103 of them were eligible for cytogenetic and/or hematologic response analyses. RESULTS: Out of 103 patients, 27% patients underwent cytogenetic analysis. Imatinib induced major cytogenetic responses in 89% and complete hematologic responses in almost 100% of the patients with confirmed CML. After a mean follow up of 27 months, an estimated 90% of the patients on imatinib remained in hematologic remission and more than 90% of the patients are still alive. About 30% of patients developed some form of manageable myelosuppression. A few patients developed non-hematologic toxic side effects such as edema and hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that imatinib is safe to use in a developing country. Furthermore, we demonstrate that imatinib is very effective and induced long lasting responses in a high proportion of patients with Ph chromosome/BCR-ABL1 positive CML. Imatinib is well tolerated by our patients. The lack of cytogenetic analysis in the majority of our patients hindered our ability to detect inadequate responses to imatinib and adjust therapy appropriately.",,"['Kayastha, Gyan K', 'Gurung, Padma', 'Acharya, Paras K', 'Paudyal, Buddhi P', 'Hayes, Bruce', 'Zimmerman, Mark', 'Karki, Arjun', 'Mansfield, Aaron S']","['Kayastha GK', 'Gurung P', 'Acharya PK', 'Paudyal BP', 'Hayes B', 'Zimmerman M', 'Karki A', 'Mansfield AS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Patan Hospital, Lalitpur Nepal. kayasthagk@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101207,England,BMC Blood Disord,BMC blood disorders,100968550,,,,PMC3017013,2010/12/09 06:00,2010/12/09 06:01,['2010/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/09 06:01 [medline]']","['1471-2326-10-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2326-10-8 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Blood Disord. 2010 Dec 7;10:8. doi: 10.1186/1471-2326-10-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is presently unknown whether thymoglobulin (TG), a preparation of polyclonal rabbit gamma immunoglobulins directed against human thymocytes, can improve the generation efficiency of CIK cells compared with alphaCD3 mAb in a clinical-grade culture protocol. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 10 healthy donors and 4 patients with solid cancer were primed with IFN-gamma on day 0 and low (50 ng/ml), intermediate (250 ng/ml) and high (500 ng/ml) concentrations of either alphaCD3 mAb or TG on day 1, and were fed with IL-2 every 3 days for 21 days. Aliquots of cells were harvested weekly to monitor the expression of representative members of the killer-like immunoglobulin receptor (KIR), NK inhibitory receptor, NK activating receptor and NK triggering receptor families. We also quantified the frequency of bona fide regulatory T cells (Treg), a T-cell subset implicated in the down-regulation of anti-tumor immunity, and tested the in vitro cytotoxic activity of CIK cells against NK-sensitive, chronic myeloid leukaemia K562 cells. RESULTS: CIK cells expanded more vigorously in cultures supplemented with intermediate and high concentrations of TG compared with 50 ng/ml alphaCD3 mAb. TG-driven CIK cells expressed a constellation of NK activating/inhibitory receptors, such as CD158a and CD158b, NKp46, NKG2D and NKG2A/CD94, released high quantities of IL-12p40 and efficiently lysed K562 target cells. Of interest, the frequency of Treg cells was lower at any time-point compared with PBMC cultures nurtured with alphaCD3 mAb. Cancer patient-derived CIK cells were also expanded after priming with TG, but they expressed lower levels of the NKp46 triggering receptor and NKG2D activating receptor, thus manifesting a reduced ability to lyse K562 cells. CONCLUSIONS: TG fosters the generation of functional CIK cells with no concomitant expansion of tumor-suppressive Treg cells. The culture conditions described herein should be applicable to cancer-bearing individuals, although the differentiation of fully functional CIK cells may be hindered in patients with advanced malignancies.",,"['Bonanno, Giuseppina', 'Iudicone, Paola', 'Mariotti, Andrea', 'Procoli, Annabella', 'Pandolfi, Annino', 'Fioravanti, Daniela', 'Corallo, Maria', 'Perillo, Alessandro', 'Scambia, Giovanni', 'Pierelli, Luca', 'Rutella, Sergio']","['Bonanno G', 'Iudicone P', 'Mariotti A', 'Procoli A', 'Pandolfi A', 'Fioravanti D', 'Corallo M', 'Perillo A', 'Scambia G', 'Pierelli L', 'Rutella S']","['Department of Gynecology, Catholic University Med.

The antitumor activity of buckwheat polysaccharides (BWPSs) has not yet been evaluated. In recent years, inducing differentiation of leukemic cells has become one of the most important therapeutic approaches for curing leukemia, and this strategy effectively inhibits leukemia cell proliferation and growth because the differentiation inducer changes leukemic cell morphology and cellular characters by inducing cellular maturity. The ability of BWPS to induce the differentiation of human leukemic THP-1 cells (monocyte [MNC]/macrophage-like cells) was investigated by both direct and indirect treatments in this study. In the indirect treatment, BWPS significantly stimulated cytokine secretion (differentiation inducer) in MNCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in MNC-conditioned medium (BWPS-MNC-CM) following a 24-hour treatment, and THP-1 cell differentiation and maturity were significantly increased after 5 days of treatment with the BWPS-MNC-CM. On the other hand, BWPS directly induced THP-1 cell differentiation and maturity following 3-day and 5-day treatments in a dose-dependent manner and exerted phagocytic activity and superoxide anion production in these mature cells.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Protein lysates from lymph nodes (n=239) from patients with the diagnosis of reactive hyperplasia (n=44), follicular lymphoma (n=63), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=43), mantle cell lymphoma (n=47), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic B-cell lymphoma (n=42) were analysed by SELDI-TOF MS. Data analysis was performed by (i) classification and regression tree-based analysis and (ii) binary and polytomous logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: After internal validation by the leave-one-out principle, both the classification and regression tree and logistic regression classification correctly identified the majority of the malignant (87 and 96%, respectively) and benign cases (73 and 75%, respectively). Classification was less successful since approximately one-third of the cases of each group were misclassified according to the histological classification. However, an additional mantle cell lymphoma case that was misclassified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic B-cell lymphoma initially was identified based on the protein profile.

The further development of these compounds as drugs for DMD treatment is currently hampered by the lack of knowledge about DIs effect in large dystrophic animal models and that of suitable biomarkers to monitor their efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study we applied proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins present in plasma samples from mdx mice treated with the Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and relative normal controls (WT). RESULTS: Several differentially expressed proteins were identified between untreated wild type and mdx mice. Among these, fibrinogen, epidermal growth factor 2 receptor, major urinary protein and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) were constitutively up-regulated in mdx, while complement C3, complement C6, gelsolin, leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFr), and alpha 2 macroglobulin were down-regulated compared to WT mice.

After a 2 h exposure, cells were still viable and 43% of spots (n = 1042) showed a significant change in protein level. We identified 59 spots whose expression had changed significantly, and these reflected cytoskeleton damage, mitochondrial lysis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Actin filament assembly was disrupted as evidenced by an increase in both actin subunits and phosphorylated cofilin, whilst levels of tropomyosin, tropomodulin and actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit decreased. Lower levels of ATP synthase subunits and mitochondrial inner membrane protein were identified as markers of mitochondrial lysis. Levels of various stress response proteins rose and, uniquely, levels of Ca(2+) binding proteins such as translationally controlled tumor protein rose and hippocalcin-like protein 1 decreased. This response may have mitigated effects brought about by mitochondrial lysis and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and delayed or prevented apoptosis in NB-4 cells. These results resemble findings of similar proteomics studies in murine macrophages, although quantitative differences were observed.","['Copyright (c) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Of these 55 proteins, 22 were over-expressed in just one cell line, and four were down-regulated in one cell line. Proteins uniquely over-expressed between myeloid and lymphoid cell lines include those that may have use as markers for diagnosis, disease progression and B-cell maturation and differentiation. Expression of various proliferation-associated nuclear proteins correlated with relative growth rates of the cell lines, giving these proteins potential diagnostic applications for distinction of chronic versus acute subtypes of haematological malignancies. Identification of these differentially expressed nuclear proteins should facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying leukocyte differentiation and transformation to leukemias and lymphomas. The nuclear expression profiles should enable classification of subtypes of leukemia, and identify potential nuclear protein targets for development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The combination of fludarabine (F) with cytarabine (ARA-C) +/- G-CSF was proven as effective in patients with poor risk AML. The efficacy and toxicity of a regimen including F + ARA-C as sequential continuous infusion (CI-FLA) in 64 untreated patients aged >60 years, in which AML arose after a previous MDS, was investigated. Median age was 67 years (61-81). In patients achieving CR, an additional course, followed by G-CSF to mobilize CD34+ cells and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were programmed. Overall, 43 patients (67%) achieved complete remission (CR). There were 10 induction deaths (16%), while 11 patients (17%) were refractory to induction treatment. Thirty-four patients (79% of remitters) were eligible for the consolidation and 30 were monitorized for the mobilization of CD34+ cells, collection being successful in 20 of them (67%). Median number of CD34+ cells/kg collected was 6.8 x 10E6. Thirteen patients (20% of the whole population) received ASCT. Median disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 10 and 9 months, respectively. Survival at 5 years is projected to 15%. The only parameter significantly related to either DFS duration or OS duration was unfavourable cytogenetics, which did significantly influence also CR achievement. CI-FLA is effective in elderly patients with AML secondary to previously diagnosed MDS. Best results are achievable in the subgroup of patients with diploid karyotype.","['Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Palmieri, Salvatore', 'Izzo, Tiziana', 'Criscuolo, Clelia', 'Riccardi, Cira']","['Ferrara F', 'Palmieri S', 'Izzo T', 'Criscuolo C', 'Riccardi C']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,2010/12/08 06:00,2011/02/03 06:00,['2010/12/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.943 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2010 Dec;28(4):202-8. doi: 10.1002/hon.943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determining the prognosis of patients with MDS is essential for discerning the best therapy, which can vary from supportive care to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The most widely used prognostic model in MDS is the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which estimates survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia based on the percentage of blasts, karyotype, and number of cytopenias, but the IPSS has several limitations that preclude more widespread application. Over the past decade, several studies have reported on new prognostic factors for MDS, including transfusion dependency and DNA methylation abnormalities. More recently, two prognostic models for MDS that aim to overcome the limitations of the IPSS have been published.

However, its effectiveness and wider applications have been greatly limited by the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a potentially lethal side effect associated with this procedure. Since the main effectors for both graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and GVHD are T lymphocytes and these two processes share many similar pathways, it has not been easy to separate GVL from GVHD. Because the clinically used pan immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD prevention also results in decreased GVL effect, the success of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation relies on a small and unpredictable therapeutic window at the present time.

Over 90% of infant ALLs are pro-B ALL harboring the leukemic fusion MLL-AF4. Despite the fact that major achievements have provided a better understanding about the etiology of infant MLL-AF4+ ALL over the last two decades, key questions remain unanswered. Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest that the in utero origin of MLL rearrangements in infant leukemia may be the result of prenatal exposure to genotoxic compounds. In fact, chronic exposure of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to etoposide induces MLL rearrangements and makes hESC more prone to acquire subsequent chromosomal abnormalities than postnatal CD34(+) cells, linking embryonic exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors to genomic instability and MLL rearrangements. Unfortunately, very little is known about the nature of the target cell for transformation. Neuron-glial antigen 2 expression was initially claimed to be specifically associated with MLL rearrangements and was recently shown to be readily expressed in CD34+CD38+, but not CD34+CD38- cells suggesting that progenitors rather than stem cells may be the target cell for transformation. Importantly, the recent findings showing that MLL-AF4 rearrangement is present and expressed in mesenchymal stem cells from infant patients with MLLAF4+ ALL challenged our current view of the etiology and cellular origin of this leukemia. It becomes therefore crucial to determine where the leukemia relapses come from and how the tumor-stroma relationship is defined at the molecular level. Finally, MLL-AF4 leukemogenesis has been particularly difficult to model and bona fide MLL-AF4 disease models do not exist so far. It is likely that the current disease models are missing some essential ingredients of leukemogenesis in the human embryo/fetus. We thus propose modeling MLL-AF4+ infant pro-B ALL using prenatal hESCs.",,"['Bueno, C', 'Montes, R', 'Catalina, P', 'Rodriguez, R', 'Menendez, P']","['Bueno C', 'Montes R', 'Catalina P', 'Rodriguez R', 'Menendez P']","['Andalusian Stem Cell Bank, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica, Consejeria de Salud-Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20101207,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antigens/analysis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Proteoglycans/analysis']",,2010/12/08 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2010/12/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010284 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.284 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Mar;25(3):400-10. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.284.

Relapse has been the major source of treatment failure for these patients. The parallel Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1953 and Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 9407 studies were designed to test the hypothesis that more intensive therapy, including dose intensification of chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) would improve the outcome for this group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-nine infants (CCG 1953, n = 115; POG 9407, n = 74) were enrolled between October 1996 and August 2000. For infants with the MLL gene rearrangement and an appropriate donor, HSCT was the preferred treatment on CCG 1953 and investigator option on POG 9407 after completion of the second phase of therapy. Fifty-three infants underwent HSCT. RESULTS: The 5-year EFS rate was 48.8% (95% CI, 33.9% to 63.7%) in patients who received HSCT and 48.7% (95% CI, 33.8% to 63.6%) in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (P = .60).

We analyzed the gene expression profiles of both T and B leukemias induced by the virus with DNA microarrays. Given that we considered that a 4-fold change in expression level was significant, 388 probe sets were associated to B, to T, or common to both leukemias. Several of them were not yet associated with lymphoid leukemia. We confirmed specific deregulation of Fmn2, Arntl2, Bfsp2, Gfra2, Gpm6a, and Gpm6b in B leukemia, of Nln, Fbln1, and Bmp7 in T leukemias, and of Etv5 in both leukemias. More importantly, we show that the mouse Fmn2 induced an anchorage-independent growth, a drastic modification in cell shape with a concomitant disruption of the actin cytoskeleton.

To better understand the role and impact of dysregulated D-cyclins in hematologic malignancies, we conducted a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of cyclin D2 transactivation and identified 8-ethoxy-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-nitro-2H-chromene (S14161), which inhibited the expression of cyclins D1, D2, and D3 and arrested cells at the G(0)/G(1) phase. After D-cyclin suppression, S14161 induced apoptosis in myeloma and leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples preferentially over normal hematopoietic cells. In mouse models of leukemia, S14161 inhibited tumor growth without evidence of weight loss or gross organ toxicity. Mechanistically, S14161 inhibited the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in intact cells and the activity of the phosphoinositide 3-kinases alpha, beta, delta, and gamma in a cell-free enzymatic assay. In contrast, it did not inhibit the enzymatic activities of other related kinases, including the mammalian target of rapamycin, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. Thus, we identified a novel chemical compound that inhibits D-cyclin transactivation via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway.

To examine Axl status in CLL, we determined the expression of phosphorylated-Axl (P-Axl) in freshly isolated CLL B cells by Western blot analysis. We detected differential levels of P-Axl in CLL B cells, and further analysis showed that expression of P-Axl was correlated with the other constitutively phosphorylated kinases, including Lyn, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, SyK/zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa, phospholipase C gamma2 in CLL B cells. We found that these intracellular signaling molecules were complexed with P-Axl in primary CLL B cells. When Axl and Src kinases were targeted by a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, bosutinib (SKI-606), or a specific-inhibitor of Axl (R428), robust induction of CLL B-cell apoptosis was observed in both a dose- and time-dependent manner.

To selectively probe the role of the SET1 family of methyltransferases, we have developed a library of histone H3 peptide mimetics and report herein the characterization of an Nalpha acetylated form of histone H3 peptide (NalphaH3). Binding and inhibition studies reveal that the addition of an acetyl moiety to the N terminus of histone H3 significantly enhances its binding to WDR5 and prevents the stimulation of MLL1 methyltransferase activity by the WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L complex. The crystal structure of NalphaH3 in complex with WDR5 reveals that a high-affinity hydrophobic pocket accommodates the binding of the acetyl moiety.

We hypothesized that maintenance of a sustained anti-leukemia response may require frequent boost injections. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight patients with myeloid malignancies were enrolled in this phase II study, and 6 completed 6 injections of PR1 and WT1 peptides in Montanide-adjuvant with GM-CSF, every two weeks. RESULTS: Both high- and low-avidity PR1 or WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in all evaluable patients after the first vaccine dose. Repeated vaccination led to selective deletion of high avidity PR1- and WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells and was not associated with significant reduction in WT1-expression. Additional boosting failed to increase vaccine-induced CD8(+) T-cell frequencies further and in all patients the response was lost before the 6(th) dose. PR1- or WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells were not detected in bone marrow samples, excluding their preferential localization to this site. Following a booster injection three months after the 6(th) vaccine dose, no high-avidity PR1 or WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells could be detected, whereas low-avidity T cells were readily expanded. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the immunogenicity of PR1 and WT1 peptide vaccines. However, repeated delivery of peptides with Montanide-adjuvant and GM-CSF leads to rapid loss of high-avidity peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells. These results may offer an explanation for the lack of correlation between immune and clinical responses observed in a number of clinical trials of peptide vaccination.

The objective of this study was to characterize the survival-inducing cross-talk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with their microenvironment to identify novel therapeutic targets. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared microarray-based expression profiles of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells before and after three different survival-inducing culture conditions: (i) stromal cell co-culture, (ii) stromal cell conditioned medium and (iii) high cell density cultures of unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cytokine antibody arrays were applied to study the composition of soluble factors present in these cultures. RESULTS: The different survival-supportive culture conditions induced distinct gene expression changes, the majority of which were common to all three conditions. Pathway analyses identified - in addition to known signaling networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - novel pathways, of which Toll-like receptor signaling, nuclear respiratory factor-2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response, and signaling via triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) were the most relevant. A high proportion of up-regulated genes were inflammatory cytokines, of which chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) was shown to be induced in monocytes by the presence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro. In addition, increased serum levels of this chemokine were detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The expansion of mutant BCR-ABL-positive clones under selective pressure of tyrosine kinase inhibition is referred to as clonal selection; there are few data on the reversibility of this phenomenon. DESIGN AND METHODS: The changes of expression of mutant BCR-ABL-positive alleles after cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment were examined in 19 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia harboring different mutations in a longitudinal follow-up. The proportion of mutant alleles was quantified by amplification of rearranged ABL sequences followed by mutation-specific restriction digestion, electrophoresis and densitometry. The size of mutant clones was established as a measure of the absolute amount of mutant cells considering the proportion of mutant BCR-ABL transcripts and the total level of BCR-ABL obtained by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The median proportion of mutant transcripts was 97% before and 8% after cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment indicating a relative decline of 88% within a median of 6 months. The relative decrease in the size of the mutant clones was 86%. Repeated selection and deselection of the mutant clone after resumption and second cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was observed in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Deselection of mutant BCR-ABL-positive clones after cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment might be a common, rapid and reproducible phenomenon, although some patients harboring the T315I mutation showed no deselection. Cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment may lead to the regression of T315I mutant clones to a level under the limit of detection, offering the therapeutic option of resumed tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment under close surveillance of the mutation status.",,"['Hanfstein, Benjamin', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Schenk, Thomas', 'Lorentz, Christian', 'Schwindel, Uwe', 'Leitner, Armin', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Hanfstein B', 'Muller MC', 'Kreil S', 'Ernst T', 'Schenk T', 'Lorentz C', 'Schwindel U', 'Leitner A', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

CEBPA-mutated acute myeloid leukemia is associated with a favorable outcome, but this may be restricted to the case of double mutations in CEBPA in adult acute myeloid leukemia. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, data on the impact of these mutations are limited to one series, and data on promoter hypermethylation are lacking. Our objective was to investigate the characteristics, gene expression profiles and prognostic impact of the different CEBPA aberrations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened a large pediatric cohort (n=252) for CEBPA single and double mutations by direct sequencing, and for promoter hypermethylation by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, we determined the gene-expression profiles (Affymetrix HGU133 plus 2.0 arrays) of this cohort (n=237). RESULTS: Thirty-four mutations were identified in 20 out of the 252 cases (7.9%), including 14 double-mutant and 6 single-mutant cases. CEBPA double mutations conferred a significantly better 5-year overall survival compared with single mutations (79% versus 25%, respectively; P=0.04), and compared with CEBPA wild-type acute myeloid leukemia excluding core-binding factor cases (47%; P=0.07). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the double mutations were an independent favorable prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio 0.23, P=0.04). The combination of screening for promoter hypermethylation and gene expression profiling identified five patients with silenced CEBPA, of whom four cases relapsed. All cases characteristically expressed T-lymphoid markers. Moreover, unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiles showed a clustering of CEBPA double-mutant and silenced cases, pointing towards a common hallmark of abrogated C/EBPalpha-functioning in these acute myeloid leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: We showed the independent favorable outcome of patients with CEBPA double-mutant acute myeloid leukemia in a large pediatric series. This molecular marker may, therefore, improve risk-group stratification in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. For the first time, CEBPA-silenced cases are suggested to confer a poor outcome in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, indicating that further investigation of this aberration is needed. Furthermore, clustering of gene expression profiles provided insight into the biological similarities and diversities of the different aberrations in CEBPA in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Hollink, Iris H I M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Arentsen-Peters, Susan T C J M', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Peeters, Justine K', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Balgobind, Brian V', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Trka, Jan', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Zwaan, C Michel']","['Hollink IH', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Arentsen-Peters ST', 'Zimmermann M', 'Peeters JK', 'Valk PJ', 'Balgobind BV', 'Sonneveld E', 'Kaspers GJ', 'de Bont ES', 'Trka J', 'Baruchel A', 'Creutzig U', 'Pieters R', 'Reinhardt D', 'Zwaan CM']","[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101206,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",PMC3046269,2010/12/08 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2010/12/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.031336 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.031336 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Mar;96(3):384-92. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.031336.

Topoisomerase II poisons, including etoposide and doxorubicin, inhibit enzyme-mediated DNA ligation causing the accumulation of double-stranded breaks and have been front-line drugs for the treatment of leukemia for many years. Voreloxin is a first-in-class anti-cancer quinolone derivative that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II. The efficacy and mechanisms of action of voreloxin in acute myeloid leukaemia were addressed in this study. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts (n = 88) and myeloid cell lines were used in vitro to study voreloxin through viability assays to assess cell killing and synergy with other drugs. Apoptosis and cell cycling were assessed by flow cytometry. DNA relaxation assays were utilized to determine that voreloxin was active on topoisomerase II. RESULTS: The mean lethal dose 50% (LD(50)) (+/- standard deviation) of voreloxin for primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts was 2.30 muM (+/- 1.87). Synergy experiments between voreloxin and cytarabine identified synergism in 22 of 25 primary acute myeloid leukemia samples tested, with a mean combination index of 0.79. Apoptosis was shown to increase in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, voreloxin was active in the p53-null K562 cell line suggesting that the action of voreloxin is not affected by p53 status. The action of voreloxin on topoisomerase II was confirmed using a DNA relaxation assay. CONCLUSIONS: Voreloxin may provide an interesting addition to the cache of drugs available for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, a disease with a poor long-term survival. In addition to its potent action as a single agent in dividing cells, the synergy we demonstrated between voreloxin and cytarabine recommends further investigation of this topoisomerase II inhibitor.",,"['Walsby, Elisabeth J', 'Coles, Steven J', 'Knapper, Steven', 'Burnett, Alan K']","['Walsby EJ', 'Coles SJ', 'Knapper S', 'Burnett AK']","['Cardiff Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK. walsbyej@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20101206,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC3046270,2010/12/08 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2010/12/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.032680 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.032680 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Mar;96(3):393-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.032680.

The Chinese herbal formula, food allergy herbal formula 2 (FAHF-2), protects against peanut anaphylaxis in mice. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are not fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether FAHF-2 inhibits mast cell/basophil numbers and IgE-mediated activation. METHODS: Mice with peanut allergy (PNA mice) were treated with FAHF-2 intragastrically for 7 weeks and challenged intragastrically with peanut 1 day and 4 weeks posttreatment. Peripheral blood basophil numbers and peritoneal mast cell numbers and FcepsilonRI expression were determined. Direct effects of FAHF-2 on the murine mast cell line MC/9, and effects of 4 fractions and 3 compounds isolated from FAHF-2 on rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) and human skin mast cells degranulation and on the IgE-mediated spleen tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, were determined. RESULTS: Although all sham-treated PNA mice developed anaphylaxis, FAHF-2-treated PNA mice were protected against anaphylaxis after peanut challenge at 1 day and 4 weeks posttherapy. Reduction of peripheral blood basophils began after 1 week of treatment and continued for at least 4 weeks posttherapy. The number and FcepsilonRI expression of peritoneal mast cells were also significantly decreased 4 weeks posttherapy. FAHF-2-treated MC/9 cells showed significantly reduced IgE-induced FcepsilonRI expression, FcepsilonRI gamma mRNA subunit expression, proliferation, and histamine release on challenge. Fraction 2 from FAHF-2 inhibited RBL-2H3 cell and human mast cell degranulation. Three compounds from fraction 2-berberine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine-inhibited RBL-2H3 cell degranulation via suppressing spleen tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Food allergy herbal formula 2 reduction of basophils and mast cell numbers as well as suppression of IgE-mediated mast cell activation may contribute to FAHF-2's persistent protection against peanut anaphylaxis.","['Copyright (c) 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

For the clearance of CMV, CD8+ T cells are pivotal. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, the novel streptamer technology was used at good manufacturing practice (GMP) level for adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T cells into acute leukemia patients with recurrent high CMV antigenemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: After a single transfusion, the frequency of CMV-specific CD8+CD45RA+CCR7- effector T cells increased dramatically from 0.0% to a maximum of 27.1% of all T cells. These T cells were clearly donor derived and did not stem from intrinsic reconstitution, as demonstrated by analysis of 1) donor chimerism through single-tandem repeats, 2) T-cell receptor excision circles, and 3) Vbeta-chain typing by polymerase chain reaction. Clinically, the specific T-cell transfer resulted in a persistent clearance of the CMV antigenemia, which allowed the patients to discontinue toxic antiviral drug therapy without further high-level reactivation of CMV, demonstrating the power of the streptamer technology. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the streptamer technology offers the advantage of selecting virus-specific CD8+ T cells at GMP level for adoptive T-cell transfer, thus inducing long-lasting specific CD8+ T-cell responses without increasing the risk for graft-versus-host disease.",['(c) 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.'],"['Schmitt, Anita', 'Tonn, Torsten', 'Busch, Dirk H', 'Grigoleit, Gotz Ulrich', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Odendahl, Marcus', 'Germeroth, Lothar', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Ringhoffer, Simone', 'Wiesneth, Markus', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Michel, Detlef', 'Mertens, Thomas', 'Rojewski, Markus', 'Marx, Martin', 'von Harsdorf, Stephanie', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Schmitt A', 'Tonn T', 'Busch DH', 'Grigoleit GU', 'Einsele H', 'Odendahl M', 'Germeroth L', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Ringhoffer S', 'Wiesneth M', 'Greiner J', 'Michel D', 'Mertens T', 'Rojewski M', 'Marx M', 'von Harsdorf S', 'Dohner H', 'Seifried E', 'Bunjes D', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, and the Institute for Virology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. michael.schmitt@med.uni-rostock.de']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101206,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (cytomegalovirus matrix protein 65kDa)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Adult', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/immunology']",,2010/12/08 06:00,2011/05/11 06:00,['2010/12/08 06:00'],"['2010/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02940.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Mar;51(3):591-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02940.x.

However, the association of TOSO expression with clinical features of CLL has not been fully described, especially in Chinese patients. TOSO expression was detected by quantitative RT-PCR in CD19+ sorted cells in a cohort of 81 untreated patients with CLL. The results showed that the expression of TOSO in CLL was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (p = 0.027) and other B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases (p = 0.033). The expression level of TOSO was significantly correlated with Binet staging, IGVH mutation status, age, and time to treatment in CLL. A negative correlation was observed between age and TOSO expression (Spearman's, p = 0.025). No correlation was observed between the expression of TOSO and CD38 or ZAP-70. Cox regression analysis indicated that high expression of TOSO (more than 8.4) was an independent indicator for shorter treatment-free survival in CLL.

Immunoglobulin gene (IG) status is preserved in the neoplastic B cell clone and can provide an indicator of the maturation stage reached by the B cell prior to transformation. In hairy cell leukemia (HCL), several pieces of data from IG analysis provide clear hints regarding the cell of origin and the ongoing selective interactions of the tumor BCR with environmental stimuli. HCLs have variable levels of IG somatic mutations, and continue somatic mutations at low levels as well as IG class switching after transformation. More recent data also show the occurrence of selective events in the light chain of the BCR, suggesting a dominant role for IG status in the pathogenesis of HCL. Moreover, it has recently emerged that an unmutated status of the HCL IG can be associated with failure to respond to cladribine, genetic abnormalities indicative of poor outcome, and aggressive disease.

Intracellular up-regulation of the AID gene in the leukemic lymphocytes of patients with CLL may be an important parameter for predicting the progression of CLL. In this study, AID mRNA expression levels were evaluated in 50 patients with CLL and 50 healthy controls. AID mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients than in controls. We then evaluated AID mRNA levels according to the stages of CLL. Regarding AID mRNA levels, patients with Rai stages 0, I, and II were compared with patients with stages III and IV, whereas patients with Binet stage A were compared with patients with Binet stages B and C. In patients with higher-risk Rai stages III and IV and Binet stages B and C, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mRNA levels were also significantly higher. Additionally, we found that the mRNA levels of patients with AID in CLL were eight-fold higher than those in control patients, suggesting that AID overexpression promotes chromosomal abnormalities and is associated with CLL progression and survival.

The use of high-throughput techniques would enable us to learn more about the biology of the disease, and make it possible to directly assess a broader range of therapeutic targets. In this study we have identified comprehensive tyrosine kinase activity profiles in leukemia samples using the PamChip(R) kinase activity profiling system. Strikingly, 31% (44/120) of the detected peptides were active in all three groups of leukemia samples. The recently reported activity of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors (NTRK1 and NTRK2) in leukemia could be appreciated in our array results. In addition, high levels of peptide phosphorylation were demonstrated for peptides related to macrophage stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R). A provisional signal transduction scheme of the common active peptides was constructed and used to specifically select an inhibitor for leukemic blast cell survival assays. As expected, a dose-dependent decrease in leukemic blast cell survival was achieved for all leukemia samples. Our data demonstrate that kinase activity profiling in leukemic samples is feasible and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of leukemia.

In addition, fluconazole was shown to be beneficial as a yeast-active prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In the past decade, the antifungal armamentarium was further enhanced with the availability of extended-spectrum azoles and echinocandins. The development of effective broad-spectrum antifungal agents has led to their use as prophylaxis rather than delaying treatment until clinical signs of infection manifest. Antigen-based and PCR-based diagnostic adjuncts facilitate earlier detection of invasive fungal diseases compared with conventional culture, and have been incorporated into strategies in which initiation or modification of an antifungal regimen is targeted to patients with the highest likelihood of having fungal disease.

Our main objective was to study the MDR1gene polymorphism at C3435T with reference to development and progression of acute leukemia. The present study included 290 acute leukemia cases, comprising of 147 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 143 acute myeloid leukemia and 249 age-sex matched control samples for the analysis of MDR1 C3435T polymorphism, by the PCR-RFLP method. The MDR1 genotype distribution revealed an elevated frequency of the TT genotype in ALL cases (51.7%) as compared to controls (28.9%), whereas AML group did not show any association. The mean white blood cell count, blast% and LDH levels were increased in ALL patients with the CC genotype. No deviation was observed with respect to hematoglobin, platelet count and disease free survival in ALL patients. The association of CC genotype with clinical variables in ALL indicated that the CC genotype with high expression might be eliminating antileukemic drugs (anthracyclines, Daunorubicin, Vincristeine, Mitoxanthrone) which are P-gp substrates, leading to lower intra cellular drug concentrations and a poor prognosis. Such an association with the CC genotype was not observed in AML.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, the presence of FLT3 mutations in childhood acute leukemias patients and their association with prognosis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients, 80 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 40 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), were included. Real time polymerase chain reaction methods on a high resolution melting analysis device were used to determine FLT3 mutations. RESULTS: FLT3/ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations were found in 6 (7.5%) of the patients with ALL and in 9 (22.5%) of those with AML, whereas no FLT3/TKD (trans kinase domain) mutation was evident in any case. There was no difference between the ALL patients positive and negative for FLT3/ITD with regard to overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and disease free survival (DFS) (p=0.37, p=0.23, p=0.023, respectively). However, in FLT3/ITD positive and negative AML patients, there was a statistically significant difference in OS (p=0.0041), but not EFS and DFS (p=0.09, p=0.095, respectively). A significant difference was found between age and FLT3/ITD positivity (p=0.036).

We have examined how Bcr-Abl-expressing cells respond to two mechanistically different therapeutic agents, etoposide and Imatinib. We also examined Bcr-Abl expression at low and high levels as elevated expression has been associated with treatment failure. Cells expressing low levels of Bcr-Abl undergo apoptosis in response to the DNA-targeting agent (etoposide), whereas high-Bcr-Abl-expressing cells primarily induce autophagy. Autophagic populations engage a delayed nonapoptotic death; however, sufficient cells evade this and repopulate following the withdrawal of the drug. Non-Bcr-Abl-expressing 32D or Ba/F3 cells induce both apoptosis and autophagy in response to etoposide and can recover. Imatinib treatment induces both apoptosis and autophagy in all Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and populations rapidly recover. Inhibition of autophagy with ATG7 and Beclin1 siRNA significantly reduced the recovery of Imatinib-treated K562 cells, indicating the importance of autophagy for the recovery of treated cells. Combination regimes incorporating agents that disrupt Imatinib-induced autophagy would remain primarily targeted and may improve response to the treatment in CML.","['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Crowley, Lisa C', 'Elzinga, Baukje M', ""O'Sullivan, Gerald C"", 'McKenna, Sharon L']","['Crowley LC', 'Elzinga BM', ""O'Sullivan GC"", 'McKenna SL']","['Leslie C.

While a number of potential therapeutic targets have emerged in CML, their expression in the LSC remains largely unknown. We therefore isolated subsets of CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells from normal donors and from patients with chronic phase or blast crisis CML. These cell subsets were then characterized based on ability to engraft immunodeficient mice and expression of candidate therapeutic targets. The CD34(+)CD38(-) CML cell population with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was the most enriched for immunodeficient mouse engrafting capacity. The putative targets: PROTEINASE 3, SURVIVIN, and hTERT were expressed only at relatively low levels by the CD34(+)CD38(-)ALDH(high) CML cells, similar to the normal CD34(+)CD38(-)ALDH(high) cells and less than in the total CML CD34(+) cells. In fact, the highest expression of these antigens was in normal, unfractionated CD34(+) cells. In contrast, PRAME and WT1 were more highly expressed by all CML CD34(+) subsets than their normal counterparts. Thus, ALDH activity appears to enrich for CML stem cells, which display an expression profile that is distinct from normal stem/progenitor cells and even the CML progenitors. Indeed, expression of a putative target by the total CD34(+) population in CML does not guarantee expression by the LSC. These expression patterns suggest that PROTEINASE 3, SURVIVIN, and hTERT are not optimal therapeutic targets in CML stem cells; whereas PRAME and WT1 seem promising.","['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Gerber, Jonathan M', 'Qin, Lu', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Griffin, Constance A', 'Vala, Milada S', 'Collector, Michael I', 'Perkins, Brandy', 'Zahurak, Marianna', 'Matsui, William', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Sharkis, Saul J', 'Levitsky, Hyam I', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Gerber JM', 'Qin L', 'Kowalski J', 'Smith BD', 'Griffin CA', 'Vala MS', 'Collector MI', 'Perkins B', 'Zahurak M', 'Matsui W', 'Gocke CD', 'Sharkis SJ', 'Levitsky HI', 'Jones RJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA. jgerber2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['5T32 HL0075225/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007525/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007525-25/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127574-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA015396-32A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA070970-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA070970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127574/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloblastin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Survivin', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3010878,2010/12/07 06:00,2011/02/12 06:00,['2010/12/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21915 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Jan;86(1):31-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21915.,,['NIHMS255525'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

BU. BU was given once daily at 130 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 and 2; doses for days 3 and 4 were adjusted in 92 patients (63%) to an average daily area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5300 muM/min. In the remaining 53 patients, the first-dose AUC was within the target range and no dosing adjustments were required. First-dose AUC, maximum concentration and clearance were not correlated with age, race, ethnicity, performance status, or hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index. Women had higher clearance than men (median 2.9 vs 2.5 mL/min/kg; P=0.001). BU toxicities were not associated with first-dose AUC or any other PK parameter measured. First-dose BU AUC was not associated with non-relapse mortality (NRM) or survival, but higher AUC was predictive of relapse. We did not find an increased risk of toxicity or NRM in patients with high first-dose AUC presumably because of the dose adjustment.

We therefore developed a toolkit that combines Tet-regulated miR30-shRNA technology, robust transactivator expression and two fluorescent reporters to track and isolate cells with potent target knockdown. We demonstrated that this system improves the study of essential genes and was sufficiently robust to eradicate aggressive cancer in mice by suppressing a single gene.

Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are frequently reported in FA patients transformed to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AIM: To study the incidence of malignancy and clonal chromosomal abnormalities in FA patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight clinically diagnosed FA patients were studied at the time of diagnosis and the patients were followed-up for a maximum of 28 months at 3-month intervals. The median duration of follow-up of these patients was 19.8 months. Chromosomal breakage investigation using mitomycin C (MMC)- and diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced peripheral blood cultures were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Cytogenetic study was done on the BM cells to detect clonal chromosomal aberrations. RESULTS: Eleven (28.95%) out of 38 patients developed malignancies, including 6 (54.54%) MDS, 4 (36.36%) AML, and 1 (2.63%) squamous cell carcinoma. The clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 5 (45.45%) FA patients who developed malignancies and the type of chromosomal abnormality detected were monosomies 5, 7, trisomy 10, dup(1)(q12-q24), and inv(7)(p11pter). CONCLUSION: The FA patients have a high risk of developing malignancies, and clonal chromosomal abnormalities play an important role in the prognosis of the disease. Therefore, FA patients need to be followed-up at regular intervals for early diagnosis and optimal management of the disease.",,"['Vundinti, B R', 'Korgaonkar, S', 'Ghosh, K']","['Vundinti BR', 'Korgaonkar S', 'Ghosh K']","['Department of Cytogenetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th floor, New multistoried building, K.E.M.

METHODS: A total of 32 allo-HSCT patients were enrolled and their data were analyzed retrospectively. Ganciclovir was used to prevent CMV infection before the transplantation. Routine fluorescence PCR was admitted to test the blood CMV DNA level. The patients were divided into 2 groups: a CMV DNA positive group and a CMV DNA negative group. Enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique was adopted regularly to monitor the blood CsA concentration. The correlation between CMV DNA level and CsA concentration was analyzed. RESULTS: The CMV infection rate in patients who received allo-HSCT was 53.13%. The blood CsA concentration in the CMV DNA positive group was significantly higher than that in the CMV DNA negative group (P<0.05). Through the ROC curve, the area under the curve on Day 1, 7, and 14 had statistical significance compared with 0.5, and the corresponding blood CsA concentration was 203.15, 215.55, and 302.65 ng/mL, respectively.

Moreover, given the strong familial risk of CLL, we further subset our GWA analysis to the CLL cases with a family history of CLL to identify loci specific to these familial CLL cases. Our top hits from these analyses were evaluated in an additional sample of 252 familial CLL cases and 965 controls. Using all available data, we identified and confirmed an independent association of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met genome-wide statistical significance within the IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) gene (combined P values </= 3.37 x 10(-8)), located in the previously identified 16q24.1 locus.

Wild-type RARalpha is a transcription factor that binds to the SMRT/NCoR family of corepressors in the absence of hormone but releases from corepressor and binds coactivators in response to retinoic acid. In contrast, the x-RARalpha fusions are impaired for corepressor release and operate in acute promyelocytic leukemia as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type RARalpha. We report that the two most common x-RARalpha fusions, PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha, have gained the ability to recognize specific splice variants of SMRT and NCoR that are poorly recognized by RARalpha. These differences in corepressor specificity between the normal and oncogenic receptors are further magnified in the presence of a retinoid X receptor heteromeric partner. The ability of retinoids to fully release corepressor from PML-RARalpha differs for the different splice variants, a phenomenon relevant to the requirement for supraphysiological levels of this hormone in differentiation therapy of leukemic cells.

Seventy-seven diseased cats were surveyed (61 antigen-negative, 16 antigen-positive). Blood, bone marrow, and tumour samples were investigated by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays detecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences of the long terminal repeats (LTR) and the envelope (env) region of the FeLV genome. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in bone marrow and tumour tissue. None of the antigen-negative cats with lymphoma was detectably infected with latent FeLV. The prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats with lymphoma was 20.8%.

We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease (>/=10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease (<10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312. FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35.9% (95% CI 25.9-45.9) in the idarubicin group versus 64.6% (54.2-73.2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0.0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45.2% (34.5-55.3) versus 69.0% (58.5-77.3; p=0.004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0.56, 0.34-0.92, p=0.007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0.52, 0.24-1.11, p=0.11). INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

We verified the association of standard clinical and laboratory variables with CR and ED and developed a web-based application for risk assessment of intensive chemotherapy in these patients. METHODS: Multivariate regression analysis was used to develop risk scores with or without knowledge of the cytogenetic and molecular risk profiles for a cohort of 1406 patients (aged >/=60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, who were treated with two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy (tioguanine, standard-dose cytarabine, and daunorubicin followed by high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone; or with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in the first and second induction courses) in the German Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Cooperative Group 1999 study. Risk prediction was validated in an independent cohort of 801 patients (aged >60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia who were given two courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin in the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 1996 study. FINDINGS: Body temperature, age, de-novo leukaemia versus leukaemia secondary to cytotoxic treatment or an antecedent haematological disease, haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, and serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase were significantly associated with CR or ED. The probability of CR with knowledge of cytogenetic and molecular risk (score 1) was from 12% to 91%, and without knowledge (score 2) from 21% to 80%. The predicted risk of ED was from 6% to 69% for score 1 and from 7% to 63% for score 2. The predictive power of the risk scores was confirmed in the independent patient cohort (CR score 1, from 10% to 91%; CR score 2, from 16% to 80%; ED score 1, from 6% to 69%; and ED score 2, from 7% to 61%). INTERPRETATION: The scores for acute myeloid leukaemia can be used to predict the probability of CR and the risk of ED in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, for whom intensive induction chemotherapy is planned. This information can help physicians with difficult decisions for treatment of these patients. FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

If XMRV is indeed able to replicate in humans, then one might predict that XMRV would have developed resistance to human innate antiviral resistance factors such as APOBEC3G (hA3G). In fact, we observed that XMRV and MLV are both highly sensitive to inhibition by hA3G and equally resistant to inhibition by murine APOBEC3. While several human prostate cancer cell lines were found to lack hA3G, stable expression of physiological levels of hA3G rendered these cells refractory to XMRV replication. Few human tissues fail to express hA3G, and we therefore hypothesize that XMRV replicates in one or more hA3G-negative reservoir tissues and/or that human XMRV infections are likely to be rare and potentially of zoonotic origin.",['Copyright A(c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants. Consistent with these genetic and epigenetic data, expression of IDH mutants impaired TET2 catalytic function in cells.

METHODS AND SAMPLE: A retrospective pilot surveillance survey was conducted in the hematology unit of a general hospital in Greece. Data were collected by using an anonymous standardised case-record form. The sample consisted of 102 hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The majority of the patients (33.3%) suffered from acute myeloid leukemia. The cumulative incidence of CDAD was 10.8% and the incidence rate of C difficile associated diarrhea was 5 per 1000 patient-days (14.2 per 1000 patient-days at risk). Patients with CDAD had twofold higher time of mean length of hospital stay compared with patients without CDAD (38.82 +/- 23.88 vs 19.45 +/- 14.56 days). Additionally patients with CDAD had received a greater number of different antibiotics compared to those without CDAD (5.18 +/- 1.99 vs 2.54 +/- 2.13), suffered from diabetes, from non Hodgkin's lymphoma, had a statistically significant higher duration of neutropenia >/=3 days and had received antifungal treatment.

Many reports have indicated that miRNAs play a critical role in malignancies, and regulations in the progression of leukemia. However, the miRNAs expression level in Chinese patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and its prognostic value remain elusive. We identified various degrees of down-regulation of miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-29b, miR-181a and miR-181b in CLL mononuclear cells. Moreover, we have identified miR-29b and miR-181a/b expression significantly correlated with IGHV mutational status. Transcript levels of predicted target genes BCL-2 and TCL-1 were also determined, and the expression levels were significantly upregulated in CLL patients compared with normal controls (P<0.001). Higher expression of TCL-1 was significantly correlated with aggressive disease features. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed in the CLL samples we examined between miRNAs (miR-16-1, miR-181a, miR-181b) and BCL-2 level; furthermore, an inverse correlation was also observed between miRNAs (miR-16-1, miR-181a, miR-181b) and TCL-1, which suggest that these miRNAs may implicate in negatively regulating target mRNA at transcriptional level. These different miRNAs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CLL and might be applied for the assessment of prognosis in patients with CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Heterozygous deletions may contain a tumor suppressor gene that undergoes homozygous inactivation or may contain one or more genes that alter the disease phenotype through haploinsufficiency. The most common karyotypic abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is deletion of chromosome 5q. A subset of patients with del(5q) as a sole cytogenetic abnormality has a consistent set of clinical features, termed the 5q- syndrome. While no tumor suppressor genes have been identified on 5q that are homozygously inactivated, recent studies have highlighted several genes and micro RNAs (miRNAs) that cause the phenotype of the 5q- syndrome through allelic insufficiency. For example, deletion of one allele of the RPS14 gene causes a severe defect in erythropoiesis, analogous to the congenital syndrome Diamond Blackfan anemia, which is itself caused by mutations that inactivate one allele of a ribosomal gene. Loss of one allele of miR-145 and miR-146a causes an increase in megakaryocyte production and may contribute to the clonal advantage of cells with del(5q).

In PRED-induced apoptosis, Bcl-2 family members play important regulatory roles. However, the exact members involved remain unknown. In this study, the roles of Bcl-2 family members in PRED-induced apoptosis and their prognostic value to day 8 PRED response are evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four clinically important acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, three PRED-sensitive (697, Sup-B15, and RS4;11) and one PRED-resistant (REH) were studied. Thirty paired patient bone marrow samples were obtained at diagnosis (day 0) and after 7 days (day 8) of PRED monotherapy. Twenty-five patients had PRED good response and five PRED poor response. Differential expressions of Bcl-2 members were observed in those samples and BIM was further investigated using gene silencing technology in representative cell line Sup-B15. RESULTS: The proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member BIM was upregulated only in PRED-sensitive cells. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that BIM expression was highly predictive of PRED response (area under the curve = 0.81; p = 0.032) in paired patient bone marrow samples and is, most excitingly, independent of molecular subtype. Patients whose BIM protein expression levels fail to upregulate at day 8 compared to day 0 (D8/D0 ratio <0.93) have significantly poorer event-free survival (60%) than those patients whose BIM protein expression levels did upregulate (92%). By silencing BIM in PRED-sensitive cells, PRED-induced apoptosis was inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of BIM by PRED in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells regardless of molecular subtype is significantly prognostic of outcomes, confirming BIM's essential regulatory role in the PRED-induced apoptosis.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Use of liver receptor homolog-1, another of the nuclear receptor 5A family nuclear receptors, with 8bromo-cAMP also resulted in the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into steroid hormone-producing cells. The same approaches could not be applied to other undifferentiated cells such as embryonic stem cells or embryonal carcinoma cells, because the over-expression of the nuclear receptor 5A family is cytotoxic to these cells. We established embryonic stem cells carrying tetracycline-regulated steroidogenic factor-1 gene at the ROSA26 locus. The embryonic stem cells were first differentiated into a mesenchymal cell lineage by culturing on collagen IV-coated dishes and treating with pulse exposures of retinoic acid before expression of steroidogenic factor-1. Although the untreated embryonic stem cells could not be converted into steroidogenic cells by expression of steroidogenic factor-1 in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor due to inability of the cells to survive, the differentiated cells could be successfully converted into steroidogenic cells when expression of steroidogenic factor-1 was induced. They exhibited characteristics of adrenocortical-like cells and produced a large amount of corticosterone. These results indicated that pluripotent stem cells could be differentiated into steroidogenic cells by the nuclear receptor 5A family of protein via the mesenchymal cell lineage.

The results indicated that EMS was a relatively rare disease characterized by the occurrence of a bcr/abl-negative myeloproliferative disorder and a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Bone marrow examination showed myeloid hyperplasia or myeloproliferative neoplasm, often accompanied by eosinophilia. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed increased myelomonoblasts; cytogenetic analysis showed a translocation at the 8p11 locus; RT-PCR demonstrated non bcr/abl fusion gene. At the molecular level, all cases carried a chromosomal abnormality involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) at chromosome 8p11. Up to now, 11 partner genes have been identified and associated with FGFR1 rearrangements. The most common partner is ZNF198 on chromosome 13q11-12. Majority of patients terminate in acute myeloid leukemia which is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Currently, the only curative option appears to be allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In conclusion, EMS is myeloid and lymphoid neoplasm, associates with FGFR1 rearrangements. It is usually misdiagnosed as T-LBL, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) or chronic myelogenous-monocytic leukemia (CMML). Timely cytogenetic and molecular biological examination is vital in order to avoid misdiagnosis and mistreatment.",,"['Yan, Zhen', 'Yang, Bo', 'Wang, Quan-Shun', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Han, Xiao-Ping', 'Ren, Fang', 'Yu, Li']","['Yan Z', 'Yang B', 'Wang QS', 'Wang LL', 'Han XP', 'Ren F', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics']",,2010/12/07 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2010/12/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)05-1321-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Oct;18(5):1321-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On day 9 of culture the DCs were counted in each groups, the phenotypes of DC were determined by flow cytometry and these DC were stained with Wright-Giemsa for observation and photography under microscopy. The results showed that the test groups all obtained a certain amount of typical DC; the number of DC in the BCG subgroup is lower than that in the GTI and GTIB subgroups (t=4.20; 6.36, p<0.01); there was no significant difference between the GTI and the GTIB subgroups (t=2.25; p>0.05).

The serum protein components were captured by weak cation exchange nanometer magnetic beads, the protein mass-spectra of all samples were detected by Autoflex II matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometer, and the detection data were analyzed by means of CliprotoolsTM2.2 software, then the differential protein molecules were screened and the diagnostic model was established. Sera of 7 AML patients and 14 healthy controls were selected to verify the established model by using blind test. The results indicated that about 69 protein peaks could be detected within the range of 0.7-10 kD in protein spectra of serum samples from AML patients and controls. Compared with healthy controls, there were 44 statistically differential expression peaks in AML group (p<0.0001). Among them, 10 protein peaks were upregulated protein peaks and 34 protein peaks were downregulated.

Mass charge ratios (m/z) were 3216.57, 4089.7, and 7762.87 respectively. Sensitivity was expected as 86.4% while 82.8% in this established model group. Category validation showed that this diagnostic model correctly identified all 6 cases out of AML and 12 cases out of 14 healthy controls. In cross validation, the model sensitivity and specificity both were 85.7%. It is concluded that the AML QC model is composed of three protein peaks, which can effectively distinguish AML patients from healthy controls.

Expression of CD59 on NB4 cells was determined by flow cytometry before and after treating with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Pig-A gene coding region was sequenced. The results showed that the deficiency of CD59 expression in 12 out of 19 APL samples was found, its incidence was significantly higher than that in other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples (deficiency of CD59 expression in 14 of 40 non-APL AML samples, p=0.042). The expression of CD59 became normal after the patients achieved complete remission (CR), which indicated that the deficient of CD59 expression was only found in APL blast cells, but also found in APL cell line NB4 cells. The expression of CD59 was not changed after NB4 cells were induced to differentiate by ATRA. Sequencing pig-A gene coding region of NB4 cells and one APL patient with deficiency of CD59 displayed that the mutation of pig-A gene was not observed, therefore the deficiency of CD59 expression in APL cells did not result from mutation of pig-A gene.

Here, we used tagged ligands derived from GALV, AMLV, and HTLV Env to monitor the distribution of their cognate receptors, the inorganic phosphate transporters PiT1 and PiT2, and the glucose transporter GLUT1, respectively, in basal conditions and after acute energy deficiency. For this purpose, we monitored changes in the distribution of PiT1, PiT2 and GLUT1 in the cerebellum, the frontal cortex, the corpus callosum, the striatum and the substantia nigra (SN) of C57/BL6 mice after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridinium (MPTP), a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor which induces neuronal degeneration in the striato-nigral network.The PiT1 ligand stained oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum and showed a reticular pattern in the SN. The PiT2 ligand stained particularly the cerebellar Purkinje cells, while GLUT1 labelling was mainly observed throughout the cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellar gray matter. Interestingly, unlike GLUT1 and PiT2 distributions which did not appear to be modified by MPTP intoxication, PiT1 immunostaining seemed to be more extended in the SN. The plausible reasons for this change following acute energy stress are discussed.These new ligands therefore constitute new metabolic markers which should help to unravel cellular adaptations to a wide variety of normal and pathologic conditions and to determine the role of specific nutrient transporters in tissue homeostasis.",,"['Lagrue, Emmanuelle', 'Abe, Hiroyuki', 'Lavanya, Madakasira', 'Touhami, Jawida', 'Bodard, Sylvie', 'Chalon, Sylvie', 'Battini, Jean-Luc', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Castelnau, Pierre']","['Lagrue E', 'Abe H', 'Lavanya M', 'Touhami J', 'Bodard S', 'Chalon S', 'Battini JL', 'Sitbon M', 'Castelnau P']","['UMR Inserm U 930, CNRS FRE 2448, Universite Francois Rabelais de Tours, F-37044 Tours, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101204,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc2a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '9P21XSP91P (1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Biomarkers/analysis/metabolism', 'Brain/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*analysis/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Virus/*analysis/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III/*analysis/metabolism']",PMC3009624,2010/12/07 06:00,2011/03/23 06:00,['2010/12/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-17-91 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-17-91 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2010 Dec 4;17:91. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-17-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report includes a review of the morphology of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), diagnosis, and the treatment options considered. DATA SOURCES: T-cell PLL is a rare blood disorder that represents a very small number of all chronic leukemias. An extensive review of scientific literature related to the cell morphology and pathology of this disease, as well as clinical trials of treatment options provided the background for this case report. CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of T-cell PLL was made after a computed tomography scan of the abdomen confirmed splenomegaly and a bone marrow biopsy showed a hypercellular marrow infiltrated with numerous small lymphocytes, consistent with this disease. Currently, there is no optimal treatment for T-cell PLL, but alemtuzumab has shown success with extending survival 1-3 years. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case presented several ethical and practical challenges for this patient and her family in making a decision for chemotherapy treatment. This case underscores the need for the physicians and nurse practitioners to establish a collaborative relationship with patient, family, and other care providers when advocating for or against treatment.","['(c)2010 The Author Journal compilation (c)2010 American Academy of Nurse', 'Practitioners.']","['Madaris, Linda']",['Madaris L'],"['University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.

METHODS: The cellularity and diagnostic accuracy of BM imprints, aspirate smears and trephine biopsy sections from 3781 patients were assessed using routine cytochemical staining. Seventy-nine cases of lymphoma and 114 cases of plasma cell myeloma (PCM) were selected for correlation analysis of tumour cell infiltration patterns. Another 21 cases of lymphoma were selected to detect t(14;18)(q32;q21) and t(11;14)(q13;q32) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on BM imprints, and the G-banding technique was performed for comparison. RESULTS: BM imprints were better than smears for evaluating cellularity. In the BM imprint group, diagnostic accuracy for metastatic carcinoma, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm and PCM was better than in the smear group, while accuracy for megaloblastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, refractory cytopenia with unilineage or multilineage dysplasia, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was higher than in the section group, but not statistically different from the smear group. Good correlation of infiltration patterns of lymphoma and myeloma cells was found between BM imprints and sections (r=0.90 and 0.78, respectively). Detection of t(11;14)(q13;q32) by FISH on imprints was higher than G-banding analysis. CONCLUSIONS: BM imprints show features of both smears and trephine sections. Imprints are superior to smears for evaluation of cellularity, and are also better than sections for analysis of cytological changes.

Exposure to hyperoxia shifts this balance towards a prodeath state that ultimately activates Bak- and Bax-dependent cell death. Mechanisms underlying this shift are undefined; however, the cell cycle inhibitor p21 delays the loss of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), and protects against hyperoxia. Here, H1299 human lung adenocarcinoma cells are used to investigate how these and other members of the Bcl-2 family cooperate with p21 to protect against hyperoxia. Expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2 or A1, declined during hyperoxia, whereas proapoptotic Bak, but not Bax, increased. Conditional overexpression of p21 selectively delayed the loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), without affecting expression of the other members. siRNA knockdown of Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) sensitized cells to hyperoxia, but only the loss of Bcl-X(L) ablated the protective effects of p21. Conversely, overexpression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) protected against hyperoxia, but only Bcl-X(L) bound Bak and Bax. Altogether, these data suggest that Bcl-X(L) is the primary mediator by which p21 protects against hyperoxia-induced Bak/Bax-dependent cell death.",,"['Wu, Yu-Chieh M', ""O'Reilly, Michael A""]","['Wu YC', ""O'Reilly MA""]","['Department of Biomedical Genetics, School of Medicine and Dentistry, The University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL067392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-67392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-66988/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL066988/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20101204,England,Exp Lung Res,Experimental lung research,8004944,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Adenocarcinoma of Lung', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxygen/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC3749887,2010/12/07 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2010/12/07 06:00'],"['2010/12/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01902148.2010.521617 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Lung Res. 2011 Mar;37(2):82-91. doi: 10.3109/01902148.2010.521617.

For physicians and technologists performing interventional procedures, more information about occupational doses should be collected and long-term follow-up studies of cancer and other serious disease risks should be initiated.

Understanding factors that modify the radiation dose response over the entire therapeutic dose range is challenging and requires large numbers of subjects. We quantified the long-term risk of thyroid cancer associated with radiation treatment among 12,547 5-year survivors of a childhood cancer (leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, kidney cancer, bone cancer, neuroblastoma) diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study using the most current cohort follow-up to 2005. There were 119 subsequent pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer cases, and individual radiation doses to the thyroid gland were estimated for the entire cohort. This cohort study builds on the previous case-control study in this population (69 thyroid cancer cases with follow-up to 2000) by allowing the evaluation of both relative and absolute risks. Poisson regression analyses were used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR), excess relative risks (ERR) and excess absolute risks (EAR) of thyroid cancer associated with radiation dose. Other factors such as sex, type of first cancer, attained age, age at exposure to radiation, time since exposure to radiation, and chemotherapy (yes/no) were assessed for their effect on the linear and exponential quadratic terms describing the dose-response relationship. Similar to the previous analysis, thyroid cancer risk increased linearly with radiation dose up to approximately 20 Gy, where the relative risk peaked at 14.6-fold (95% CI, 6.8-31.5). At thyroid radiation doses >20 Gy, a downturn in the dose-response relationship was observed. The ERR model that best fit the data was linear-exponential quadratic.

Much of our work has focused on unrelated cord blood transplantation as the dominant clinical scenario and laboratory model. Our overarching goal is to minimize transplant-related mortality and morbidity and render HLA-mismatched unrelated cord blood transplant, a widely accepted safe cellular therapy. Donor leukocyte infusions in the allogeneic hematopoietic transplant setting can provide a clinically relevant boost of immunity to reduce opportunistic infections and to increase graft-versus-leukemia activity. Our laboratory has a major focus toward ex vivo expansion of cord blood T cells with anti-apoptotic cytokines and CD3/CD28 co-stimulatory beads. Expanded lymphocytes lack alloreactivity against recipient and other allogeneic cells indicating a favorable safety profile from graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, expanded T cells can be primed subsequently against lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells to generate tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms that control hMSC trans-differentiation to neural cells and hMSC tropism toward glioma remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hMSCs incubated with 50 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) acquired astroglial cell morphology without affecting proliferation, which was increased at 5 ng/ml. TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml) upregulated expression of numerous genes important for neural cell growth and function including LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2), SOX2 (SRY box 2), and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), whereas NES (human nestin) transcription ceased suggesting a premature neural phenotype in TNF-alpha-differentiated hMSCs. Studies on intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling revealed that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity abolished the TNF-alpha-mediated regulation of neural genes in hMSCs. In addition, TNF-alpha significantly enhanced expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (CXC motive chemokine receptor 4), which facilitated the chemotactic invasiveness of hMSCs toward stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) alpha. TNF-alpha-pretreated hMSCs not only exhibited an increased ability to infiltrate glioma cell spheroids dependent on matrix metalloproteinase activity in vitro, but they also showed a potentiated tropism toward intracranial malignant gliomas in an in vivo mouse model.

Median hemoglobin pre-treatment was 7.7 g/100 ml, and median platelet count 36.5 x 10(9)/l, returning to a median of 12.5 /100ml and 37.5 x 10(9)/l, respectively. Overall, an 89.5% response rate was obtained with this combination, irrespective of the AID type. Relapse occurred in 19 patients (39.6%). Median duration of response for autoimmunity (DR-AI) was 24 months, but DR-AI was higher for patients presenting: (1) AID early during CLL course (<3 years), or (2) both PRCA and AIHA. Median time to CLL progression in 48 patients was 16 months, but this time was statistically shorter for Evan's syndrome and AITP patients as compared with AIHA and PRCA patients.

We review the clinical course and treatment outcome of APL and explore the role of standard-dose Ara-C for children. PROCEDURE: Between January 1999 and December 2008, 36 children (<14 y) with newly diagnosed APL were included. RESULTS: The overall complete remission rate was 97.2% (35/36). Two patients were lost to follow-up after induction. Two groups of patients were identified according to different consolidation chemotherapy regimens. Seventeen patients were given polychemotherapy in combination with standard-dose Ara-C (group I), 16 patients were given daunorubicin alone (group II). Although the 5-year estimate of disease-free survival between groups I and II had no statistically significant difference (P = 0.614), there was a 12% higher disease-free survival rate for group I.

Here, we hypothesized that G6 suppresses Jak2-V617F-mediated human pathological cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We found that G6 inhibited proliferation of the Jak2-V617F expressing human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line by promoting marked cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. The G6-dependent increase in apoptosis levels was concomitant with increased caspase 3/7 activity and cleavage of PARP. G6 also selectively inhibited phosphorylation of STAT5, a downstream signaling target of Jak2. Using a mouse model of Jak2-V617F-mediated hyperplasia, we found that G6 significantly decreased the percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood, reduced splenomegaly, and corrected a pathologically low myeloid to erythroid ratio in the bone marrow by eliminating HEL cell engraftment in this tissue. In addition, drug efficacy correlated with the presence of G6 in the plasma, marrow, and spleen.

As high-resolution, genome-wide analyses of leukemic and normal host cells continue to identify novel subtypes of lymphoblastic leukemia and provide new insights into leukemogenesis, we can look forward to the time when all cases of this disease will be classified according to specific genetic abnormalities, some of which will yield ""druggable"" targets for more effective and less toxic treatments. Meanwhile, it is sobering to consider that a significant fraction of leukemia survivors will develop serious health problems within 30 years of their initial diagnosis. This underlines the need to introduce early countermeasures to reduce late therapy-related effects. The ultimate challenge is to gain a clear understanding of the factors that give rise to childhood leukemia in the first place, and enable preventive strategies to be devised and implemented.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

A higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate has been noted with these 2 types of transplants, primarily because of infectious complications. Here, we hypothesized that the time to lymphocyte recovery (absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] of >/=1000/muL for the first 3 consecutive days) after transplant correlates with outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 65 consecutive patients treated at our institution with cord blood (n = 37) and haploidentical (n = 28) transplantation with myeloablative fludarabine, melphalan, and thiotepa conditioning. Patients with lymphocyte recovery at day 60 posttransplant were more likely to survive long term than those without lymphocyte recovery. In multivariate analysis, ALC recovery was the only independent prognostic factor associated with mortality; patients without ALC recovery were 10.5 times (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.3-25.4) more likely to die than those with ALC recovery (P < .0001). This difference appeared to be related to NRM (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.1, 95% CI: 0.02-0.6, P = .008), whereas ALC recovery did not influence the rate of disease relapse. These results suggest that ALC recovery is an important prognostic indicator for patients treated with cord blood and T cell-depleted peripheral haploidentical transplants.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recently, two randomised studies showed the efficacy of a posaconazole prophylaxis (PP) in these patients to prevent IFI. This prompted the strong recommendation for the use of PP in national and international guidelines. As we started PP in our leukaemia and transplantation unit in summer 2007, we retrospectively analysed the impact of PP on the incidence of possible, probable or proven IFI in this group of patients. Incidence of IFI according to the revised EORTC criteria, published in 2008, was reviewed retrospectively in a group of high-risk patients treated in our unit 1 year before the start of PP compared with the same group in the following year with PP. First analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis comparing patients during 1 year of PP with the same group of patients in the year before the start of PP. In a second, deeper analysis, patients were grouped for fluconazole or posaconazole irrespective of the time period the prophylaxis was given. In a first intent-to-treat analysis, 56 patients were analysed in the period without PP (noPP) compared with 34 patients in the period with PP. Overall IFI rates (possible, probable and proven IFI) were reduced from 47% (noPP group) to 35% (PP group). In a second analysis, only patients receiving either fluconazole or PP were analysed, resulting in 29 patients in the noPP group and 36 patients in the PP group. There was a reduction in overall IFI in the PP group especially in the acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) induction patients, but this does not reach statistical significance because of low patient numbers. However, initiation of antifungal therapy was significantly less frequent in AML induction patients in the PP group compared with the noPP group. Unfortunately, this does not result in reduced mortality rates, as mortality in the PP group is higher (15% vs. 7%) than in noPP patients because of double the number of patients with severe GvHD in the PP group. Both breakthrough infections were documented in this subgroup of patients. Our data, collected in every day clinical practice, add further evidence to the advantage of a PP strategy in this group of high-risk patients. However, more data are urgently needed to assess the impact of PP on the incidence and pattern of fungal infections and the strategies to be used in patients with persisting fever and pulmonary infiltrates receiving PP, especially in the setting of SCT and GvHD.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],"['Hahn, J', 'Stifel, F', 'Reichle, A', 'Holler, E', 'Andreesen, R']","['Hahn J', 'Stifel F', 'Reichle A', 'Holler E', 'Andreesen R']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany. joachim.hahn@klinik.uni-regensburg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/therapy', 'Hematology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,2010/12/16 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/12/04 06:00'],"['2010/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1439-0507.2010.01980.x [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2011 Jan;54 Suppl 1:12-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2010.01980.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BNIP3 and NIX cause cell death by targeting mitochondria, directly through BCL-2-associated X protein- or BCL-2-antagonist/killer-dependent mechanisms, or indirectly through an effect on calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. BNIP3 and NIX also induce autophagy through an effect on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, or by releasing Beclin 1 from inhibitory interactions with antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. BNIP3 downregulates mitochondrial mass in hypoxic cells, whereas NIX is required for mitochondrial elimination during erythroid development. BNIP3 and NIX have an emerging role in human health. Cell death mediated by BNIP3 and NIX is implicated in heart disease and ischemic injury. Cancer progression is linked to loss of the prodeath function of BNIP3, but also to induction of its prosurvival activity. Finally, BNIP3 and NIX are implicated in mitochondrial quality control, which is important in aging and degenerative disease.

Therefore, finding culture conditions that maintain the self-renewal of ESCs, preventing their differentiation and promoting their proliferation, is still an area of great interest. In this work, we studied the effects of the conditioned medium from a bovine granulosa cell line (BGC-CM) on the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs. We found that this medium is able to maintain mESCs' self-renewal while preserving its critical properties without LIF addition. mESCs cultured in BGC-CM expressed the stem cell markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, SSEA-1, Klf4, Rex1, and ECAT1. Moreover, mESCs cultured in BGC-CM gave rise to embryoid bodies and teratomas that differentiated effectively to diverse cell populations from endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Further, we found that mESCs cultured in BGC-CM have an increased proliferation rate compared with cells grown in the mESC standard culture medium supplemented with LIF. These findings may provide a powerful tool to culture mESCs for long periods of time with high proliferation rate while preserving its basic characteristics, contributing to the application of these cells to assess potential tissue engineering and cellular therapy applications.",,"['Losino, Noelia', 'Luzzani, Carlos', 'Solari, Claudia', 'Boffi, Juan', 'Tisserand, Mariana Louis', 'Sevlever, Gustavo', 'Baranao, Lino', 'Guberman, Alejandra']","['Losino N', 'Luzzani C', 'Solari C', 'Boffi J', 'Tisserand ML', 'Sevlever G', 'Baranao L', 'Guberman A']","['Laboratorio de Regulacion de la Expresion Genica en el Crecimiento, Supervivencia y Diferenciacion Celular, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110112,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cattle', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Granulosa Cells/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",,2010/12/04 06:00,2012/01/28 06:00,['2010/12/04 06:00'],"['2010/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2010.0336 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2011 Aug;20(8):1439-49. doi: 10.1089/scd.2010.0336.

The siRNAs were designed to knock down the bcr/abl oncogene in leukaemia K562 cells. EDAC used as a cross-linker, COOH-functionalized QDs were conjugated with NH2-modified siRNAs to generate QD-siRNA conjugates. We also demonstrated their application to the K562 cells. Using such constructs, the delivery and transfection of siRNAs could be monitored by the presence of fluorescent QDs in the conjugates. QDs not only exhibited superior photostability for labeling cells but also worked as a good vector that remarkably increased the transfection efficiency of siRNAs into the cells.

Previous research on the epigenetics of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly focused on the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes as a result of DNA methylation. However, the basic molecular pathogenesis of epigenetics in MDS remains poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed that DNA methylation and histone modification may be controlled by Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins, which may give new clues toward understanding the epigenetic mechanism of MDS. In this study, we explored for the first time the expression of PcG genes, including EZH2, EED, SUZ12, RING1, and BMI1, in various MDS subsets and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as the relationship between the expression of PcG genes and epigenetic alteration and prognosis-risk scoring. Patients with MDS/AML showed overexpression of EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 genes compared to their expression levels in patients with non-clonal cytopenia diseases. The MDS patients with DNA methylation had higher EZH2 expression than those without DNA methylation. The patients who received decitabine treatment presented significantly reduced expression of EZH2 and RING1 besides decreased p15(INK4B) methylation after decitabine treatment. Moreover, overexpression of EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 was always linked to poor prognostic scoring. In conclusion, overexpression of the EZH2, RING1, and BMI1 genes is common in MDS and indicate poor prognosis. The products of these genes might participate in epigenetic regulation of MDS.

Despite important achievements in the treatment of AML, the long term survival of patients with the disease remains poor. Understanding the pathogenesis of AML better is crucial for finding new treatment approaches. During AML development, hematopoietic precursor cells undergo clonal transformation in a multistep process through acquisition of chromosomal rearrangements and/or different gene mutations. Over recent years, novel gene mutations have been found in patients with AML. These mutations can be divided into two important categories, class I mutations that confer a proliferation advantage and class II mutations that inhibit myeloid differentiation. Screening for some of these mutations is now part of the initial diagnostic workup in newly diagnosed AML patients. Information about the mutation status of specific genes is useful for risk-stratification, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring and increasingly also for targeted therapy, especially for patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Besides chromosomal rearrangements and gene mutations, epigenetic regulation of genes - meaning changes in gene expression by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence - also represents an important mechanism of leukemogenesis.

A common feature of the mammalian MLL/SET1 complexes is the presence of three core components (RbBP5, Ash2L and WDR5) and a catalytic subunit containing a SET domain. Unlike most other histone lysine methyltransferases, all four proteins are required for efficient H3 K4 methylation. Despite extensive efforts, mechanisms for how three core components regulate MLL/SET1 methyltransferase activity remain elusive. Here we show that a heterodimer of Ash2L and RbBP5 has intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity. This activity requires the highly conserved SPRY domain of Ash2L and a short peptide of RbBP5. We demonstrate that both Ash2L and the MLL1 SET domain are capable of binding to S-adenosyl-L- [methyl-(3)H] methionine in the MLL1 core complex. Mutations in the MLL1 SET domain that fail to support overall H3 K4 methylation also compromise SAM binding by Ash2L. Taken together, our results show that the Ash2L/RbBP5 heterodimer plays a critical role in the overall catalysis of MLL1 mediated H3 K4 methylation. The results we describe here provide mechanistic insights for unique regulation of the MLL1 methyltransferase activity.

The prevailing view about the role of I(Hv) in phagocytes is that it is an essential supporter of the intense and sustained activity of Nox2 (the core enzyme of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex) during respiratory burst. Recently H(v)1, a voltage-gated proton channel, was cloned, and leukocytes from H(v)1 knockout mice display impaired respiratory burst. On the other hand, hardly anything is known about H(v)1 in human granulocytes. Using qPCR and a self made antibody, we detected a significant amount of H(v)1 in human eosinophil and neutrophil granulocytes and in PLB-985 leukemia cells. Using different crosslinking agents and detergents in reducing and non-reducing PAGE, significant expression of H(v)1 homodimers, but not that of higher-order multimers, could be detected in granulocytes. Results of subcellular fractionation and confocal imaging indicate that H(v)1 is resident in both plasmalemmal and granular membrane compartments of resting neutrophils. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that H(v)1 accumulates in phagosome wall during zymosan engulfment together with, but independently of Nox2. During granulocytic differentiation early and parallel upregulation of H(v)1 and Nox2 expression was observed in PLB-985 cells. The upregulation of H(v)1 or Nox2 expression did not require the normal expression of the other molecule. Using RNA interference, we obtained strong correlation between H(v)1 expression and I(Hv) density in PLB-985 cells. It is also demonstrated that a massive reduction in H(v)1 expression can limit the Nox2 mediated superoxide production of PLB-985 granulocytes. In summary, beside monomers native H(v)1 forms stable proton channel dimer in resting and activated human granulocytes. The expression pattern of H(v)1 in granulocytes is optimized to support intense NADPH oxidase activity.",,"['Petheo, Gabor L', 'Orient, Anna', 'Barath, Monika', 'Kovacs, Istvan', 'Rethi, Bence', 'Lanyi, Arpad', 'Rajki, Aniko', 'Rajnavolgyi, Eva', 'Geiszt, Miklos']","['Petheo GL', 'Orient A', 'Barath M', 'Kovacs I', 'Rethi B', 'Lanyi A', 'Rajki A', 'Rajnavolgyi E', 'Geiszt M']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. gabor.petheo@eok.sote.hu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101123,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HVCN1 protein, human)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Eosinophils/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Ion Channels/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/metabolism', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",PMC2990768,2010/12/03 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2010/12/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0014081 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Nov 23;5(11):e14081. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0014081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These structural features induce the formation of a stable beta-strand-type structure, giving rise to an overall tubular structure over 30 A in length. In a biological setting, this fold is believed to transport cations across the lipid bilayer through a pore, thereby acting as an ion channel. Here, we report the first chemical construction of polytheonamide B.

The reversible nature of epigenetic modifications has lead to the development of drugs that target DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases, which have been used to re-express aberrantly silenced genes in leukemia.

METHODS: 103 consolidation cycles were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received treatment as inpatients; they were discharged provided they were in a good clinical condition and then either electively readmitted or managed as outpatients during the aplastic phase. RESULTS: In 95/103 cycles (92%), discharge was feasible after a median of 7 (6-16) days. In 45 cycles, patients were electively readmitted at the onset of chemotherapy induced cytopenia after a median time of 12 (9-16) days. In 50 cycles, patients were managed as outpatients. In 23/50 outpatient cycles (46%), patients required rehospitalization, the main cause being neutropenic fever. There was 1 treatment related death due to sepsis in a patient in the outpatient group, accounting for an overall mortality of 2%. Transfusion requirements, occurrence of grade 3-4 toxicity, and disease free and overall survival after a median followup of 20 months did not differ between the treatment strategies. Comparison of diagnosis related group (DRG) proceeds revealed a 40% reduction with the outpatient strategy. CONCLUSION: Outpatient management of consolidation therapy in selected AML patients appears to be feasible and safe and may reduce hospital treatment costs.","['Copyright (c) 2010 S.

Mutagenesis screens in zebrafish and mice identified Hspa9 as a del(5q31.2) candidate gene that may contribute to MDS and AML pathogenesis, respectively. To test whether HSPA9 haploinsufficiency recapitulates the features of ineffective hematopoiesis observed in MDS, we knocked down the expression of HSPA9 in primary human hematopoietic cells and in a murine bone marrow-transplantation model using lentivirally mediated gene silencing. Knockdown of HSPA9 in human cells significantly delayed the maturation of erythroid precursors, but not myeloid or megakaryocytic precursors, and suppressed cell growth by 6-fold secondary to an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in the cycling of cells compared with control cells. Erythroid precursors, B lymphocytes, and the bone marrow progenitors c-kit(+)/lineage(-)/Sca-1(+) (KLS) and megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) were significantly reduced in a murine Hspa9-knockdown model.

Here, we provide evidence that this transspecification is regulated by the chromatin architecture protein Satb2. Treatment with the neuropoietic cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor rapidly and strongly increases Satb2 transcript and protein levels in cultures of rat superior cervical ganglia neurons. Knockdown of endogenous Satb2 by short interfering RNA prevents the upregulation of choline acetyltransferase (Chat) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (Vacht) by CNTF as well as the loss of norepinephrine transporter (Net). Conversely, overexpression of Satb2 in the noradrenergic sympathetic phenotype results in a marked increase of Chat and Vacht expression and reduced Net mRNA levels in the absence of neuropoietic cytokines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in primary sympathetic neurons reveals that Satb2 binds to matrix attachment regions (MARs) within the Chat locus.

OBJECTIVES: To describe health inequities experienced by children with chronic health conditions. METHODS: We performed a literature review of English-language studies identified from the Medline, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Cancer Institute, and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Web sites that were published between January 1985 and May 2009, included children aged 0 to 18 years, and contained the key words ""incidence,"" ""prevalence,"" ""survival,"" ""mortality,"" or ""disparity"" in the title or abstract for the following health conditions: acute leukemia, asthma, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome, HIV/AIDS, major congenital heart defects, major depressive disorder, sickle cell anemia, spina bifida, and traumatic brain injury. RESULTS: Black children had higher rates of cerebral palsy and HIV/AIDS, were less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, had more emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and had higher mortality rates associated with asthma; and survived less often with Down syndrome, type 1 diabetes, and traumatic brain injury when compared with white children. Hispanic children had higher rates of spina bifida from Mexico-born mothers, had higher rates of HIV/AIDS and depression, were less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, had poorer glycemic control with type 1 diabetes, and survived less often with acute leukemia compared with white children.

To repair these lesions BCR/ABL stimulate unfaithful DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination repair (HRR), nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and single-strand annealing (SSA). Here, we show that BCR/ABL enhances the expression and increase nuclear localization of WRN (mutated in Werner syndrome), which is required for processing DSB ends during the repair. Other fusion tyrosine kinases (FTK), such as TEL/ABL, TEL/JAK2, TEL/PDGFbetaR, and NPM/ALK also elevate WRN. BCR/ABL induces WRN mRNA and protein expression in part by c-MYC-mediated activation of transcription and Bcl-xL-dependent inhibition of caspase-dependent cleavage, respectively. WRN is in complex with BCR/ABL resulting in WRN tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of its helicase and exonuclease activities. Activated WRN protects BCR/ABL-positive cells from the lethal effect of oxidative and genotoxic stresses, which causes DSBs. In addition, WRN promotes unfaithful recombination-dependent repair mechanisms HRR and SSA, and enhances the loss of DNA bases during NHEJ in leukemia cells. In summary, we postulate that BCR/ABL-mediated stimulation of WRN modulates the efficiency and fidelity of major DSB repair mechanisms to protect leukemia cells from apoptosis and to facilitate genomic instability.",,"['Slupianek, Artur', 'Poplawski, Tomasz', 'Jozwiakowski, Stanislaw K', 'Cramer, Kimberly', 'Pytel, Dariusz', 'Stoczynska, Ewelina', 'Nowicki, Michal O', 'Blasiak, Janusz', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Slupianek A', 'Poplawski T', 'Jozwiakowski SK', 'Cramer K', 'Pytel D', 'Stoczynska E', 'Nowicki MO', 'Blasiak J', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA123014-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123014-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123014-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101201,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (WRN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Werner Syndrome Helicase)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Wrn protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RecQ Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Werner Syndrome Helicase']",PMC3032814,2010/12/03 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2010/12/03 06:00'],"['2010/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1066 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1066 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Feb 1;71(3):842-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1066.

Many oncogenetic aberrations in acute leukemias result in a fusion gene, which is transcribed into fusion transcripts and translated into fusion proteins, which are assumed to play a critical role in the oncogenetic process. Fusion gene aberrations are detected by karyotyping, FISH, or RT-PCR analysis. However, these molecular genetic techniques are laborious and time consuming, which is in contrast to flow cytometric techniques. Therefore we developed a flow cytometric immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins in lysates of leukemia cell samples by use of a bead-bound catching antibody against one side of the fusion protein and fluorochrome-conjugated detection antibody. So far, we have been able to design such fusion protein immunobead assays for BCR-ABL, PML-RARA, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11. The immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins can be performed within 3 to 4 hours in a routine diagnostic setting, without the need of special equipment other than a flow cytometer. The novel immunobead assay will enable fast and easy classification of acute leukemia patients that express fusion proteins. Such patients can be included at an early stage in the right treatment protocols, much faster than by use of current molecular techniques. The immunobead assay can be run in parallel to routine immunophenotyping and is particularly attractive for clinical settings without direct access to molecular diagnostics.",['Copyright (c) 2010.

It exhibits a complex pathophysiology resulting from donor T cell recognition of a genetically disparate recipient that is unable to reject the donor cells following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) and ultimately causes multiple organs destruction. Currently practiced prophylaxis of GVHD includes T-cell depletion (TCD) and/or immunosuppressive medication. However, immunosuppressive agents may have serious side effects and selective removal of T cells from the graft significantly reduces the beneficial effects of donor T cells, especially anti-tumor activity. These deleterious side effects of infectious complications and relapse of underlying malignancy remain barriers to successful approaches. The proteasomal pathway of protein degradation plays a key role in different key cell functions such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and costimulation. Proteasome inhibition in cancer cells leads to induction of tumor cell death and also plays critical roles in T cell activation, proliferation, and apoptosis, in part, because of blockade of NF-kappaB activation. Recently it was reported clioquinol can inhibit the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity and induce apoptotic cell death in leukemia and myeloma. We hypothesized that proteasome inhibitor clioquinol could be a candidate drug for pharmacological prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD with retention of graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

NPM1 mutations have been recently identified as the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia and are related to leukemogenesis. NPM1 mutations are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. However, the oncogenic potential of NPM1 mutations is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the change of cell migration and invasion in vitro and the role of NPM1 mutations in this process. In our study, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NPM1 mutation A (NPM1 mA), and the cell chemotactic response in vitro was evaluated by cell migration and invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and CXCR4 were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Our findings suggested that the migration and invasion of NIH3T3 cells were significantly enhanced after transfection with NPM1 mA (p<0.01). Furthermore, there was greater expression of MMP-9 and CXCR4 (p<0.01), but a lower expression of MMP-2 in the NPM1 mA group. These results demonstrate that NPM1 mutations may promote cell migration and invasion in vitro, and MMP-9 and CXCR4 may be involved in the regulation of cell invasion.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used population-based medical databases to identify 209 patients who were diagnosed with HCL in the period from January 1997 to August 2007 in Denmark. An age- and sex-matched comparison cohort of 2,090 persons was selected from the general population. We computed the incidence of HCL using demographic data. Hospitalizations with pneumonia and bacteraemia were determined from the Danish National Patient Registry. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of infection and mortality ratios (MRR) adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity. RESULTS: The HCL incidence rates were 1.97 (95% confidence interval 1.51-2.53) and 5.37 (4.57-6.28) per million person-years for women and men, respectively.

METHODS: DNA samples of fifteen newly diagnosed adult B-ALL patients were collected. The IgH gene rearrangements were detected by PCR followed by sequencing and subsequent blasting for monoclonal PCR products. Allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) were designed based on the sequence of junction regions, using PRIMER 5.0 software. MRD targets were detected in 115 bone marrow samples by RQ-PCR, in which ASO upstream primers in combination with the consensus JH probes and downstream primers were used. Transcripts copies of bcr-abl fusion gene were also measured in 7 Ph(+) ALL cases. RESULTS: The detection sensitivity of ASO-PCR varied between 10(-3) and 10(-5) leukemia cells in 15 adult ALL patients. The background and nonspecific amplification was detectable at a low level. Quantification monitoring MRD showed that high-risk adult ALL patients in complete remission (CR) had a higher MRD level than those of standard-risk.

METHODS: Imatinib-resistant K562/G cells were obtained by culturing cells in gradually increasing concentrations of imatinib. The changed factors related to drug-resistance were tested by Western blot. ZD6474 and imatinib affected K562/G and parental K562 cells proliferation were analyzed by WST assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle. Direct inhibition of Src activity by ZD6474 was measured by a colorimetric ELISA assay with recombinant human Src kinase. RESULTS: 10 micromol/L imatinib failed to inhibit K562/G cells proliferation or induce cell cycle arrest. Compared with that in parental K562 cells, there were marked high levels of p-Src and Src protein in K562/G cells. The expression of Bcl-2 and p-STAT3 also increased in K562/G cells. After 48 hours incubation, the IC(50) values of ZD6474 in K562 and K562/G cells were 1.61 micromol/L and 3.18 micromol/L, respectively. ZD6474 treatment caused accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) fraction and cell apoptosis in K562 and K562/G cells. ZD6474 decreased the expression of p-Src and Src at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, ZD6474 increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and decreased the expression of p-STAT3 at the same concentration for inducing apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: ZD6474 is effective in inhibiting the proliferation of imatinib-resistant K562/G cells and parental K562 cells, and induces their apoptasis by significant inhibition of Src kinase activity.

METHODS: The outcome of 73 patients with newly diagnosed APL were retrospectively analyzed. According to the induction regimens, the patients were divided into three groups: chemotherapy-only (14 cases group I), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or combined with chemotherapy (33 cases group II), and ATRA combined with arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) (26 cases group III). The complete remission (CR) rate and the time to CR (TTC) were analyzed. After CR, the patients were divided into 2 groups for post-remission therapies: one with sequential treatment of chemotherapy/ATRA/As(2)O(3) and the other with alternative treatment of chemotherapy/ATRA. The overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and relapse rate were compared between these two groups. Patients induced CR with both ATRA and As(2)O(3), and then sequentially treated with chemotherapy/ATRA/As(2)O(3) (group A), and those induced CR with ATRA or As(2)O(3) alone and then with non-chemotherapy/ATRA/As(2)O(3) sequentially (group B) were also analyzed and compared for CR, OS and DFS. RESULTS: (1) For induction treatment, the CR rate in ATRA and As(2)O(3) combination group was 100%, in ATRA combined with chemotherapy group was 78.8%, and in chemotherapy-only group was 57.1% (P = 0.030). The median TTC in ATRA with As(2)O(3) combination group was 26 (13 - 40) days being the shortest among the three groups. (2) For the post-remission treatment, 3-year OS rates in group I and group II were (95.7 +/- 4.3)% and (68.6 +/- 11.2)% (P < 0.05), and 3-year DFS rates were (79.0 +/- 9.5)%, and (32.9 +/- 15.5)%, respectively (P < 0.01). The relapse rate was 14.8% in group I, and 50.0% in group II (P = 0.011). (3) The CR, 3-year OS and DFS rates in group A were all 100%. The CR rate in ATRA or As(2)O(3) alone induced group was 72.9%, and 3-year OS was (72.3 +/- 9.1)% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For adult APL induction with ATRA and As(2)O(3) combination can obtain a higher CR rate, and shorter TTC. The post-remission treatment with sequential chemotherapy, ATRA and As(2)O(3) results in a lower relapse rate, and significantly improves OS and DFS.

METHODS: The expressions of APP mRNA in 85 AML and 20 nonmalignant hematological diseases patients (as control) were measured by real-time PCR. The expression of APP in AML cell lines was also examined by real-time PCR and Western blot and the results were compared with those in their original subtypes. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting APP gene were synthesized and transfected into HL-60 cell by lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h, 48h and 72 h. Cell growth was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion and MTT, differentiation by Wright-Giemsa staining, cell cycle by PI/RNase staining, apoptosis by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst33342 staining. Apoptosis-related protein NF-kappaB, bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were detected by Western blot after siRNAs transfection for 48 h. Sensitivity to adriamycin was measured by MTT.

Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated transcriptional events that lead to the induction of apoptosis of leukemia cells, as well as the causes for the development of resistance in leukemia patients, are not yet understood. It is thought that the B-cell lymphoma 2 family members that control apoptosis, including some of the GR target genes, may play an important role in deciding cell fate. In this report we have employed pathway modeling due to the recent discovery of its usefulness as a tool for improving understanding of the mechanisms of cellular signaling, and in discovering new therapeutic targets for the treatment of various diseases. MATERIALS & METHODS: Detailed kinetics of GR autoregulation, as well as the kinetics of expression of its target genes and proteins Bcl-xL, Bim, Bmf and GILZ in glucocorticoid responsive and resistant leukemia cell lines were carried out. Subsequently in order to obtain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of GR signaling in this pathway a dynamic model of the induction of these genes and proteins by GR was constructed. RESULTS: The simulations were in good agreement with the observed experimental data suggesting that Bim was induced between 6 and 10 h after the addition of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, possibly through rapid glucocorticoid dependent modulation of an unknown factor.

On the basis of the evidence that CLL cells have enhanced expression of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isoform 7B (PDE7B), we hypothesized that PDE7B expression might provide such information. We assessed PDE7B mRNA expression using quantitative real-time PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 85 patients and 30 normal subjects. We compared PDE7B mRNA expression with that of other disease features to determine if its expression correlates with the prognosis of patients with CLL. We found that CLL patients with PDE7B mRNA levels in the top quartile (greater than ninefold elevation relative to normal controls) have a several-year shorter median time-to-treatment (TTT, 36 months) compared to that of patients whose CLL cells express lower levels of PDE7B mRNA (TTT, 77 months, p=0.001). High PDE7B mRNA expression correlates with expression of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region genes and beta2 microglobulin (beta2M), but use of a multivariate Cox model revealed that high PDE7B mRNA expression independently predicts a short TTT, even after adjusting for several other disease characteristics (ZAP-70 or CD38 expression, IGHV mutation status and Rai status). High expression of PDE7B is an unfavorable characteristic in CLL. Assessment of PDE7B mRNA expression thus appears to be a clinically useful biomarker to define the prognosis of patients with CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],"['Zhang, Lingzhi', 'Murray, Fiona', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Pu, Minya', 'Kelly, Colleen', 'Kanter, Joan R', 'Greaves, Andrew', 'Messer, Karen', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Insel, Paul A']","['Zhang L', 'Murray F', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Pu M', 'Kelly C', 'Kanter JR', 'Greaves A', 'Messer K', 'Kipps TJ', 'Insel PA']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0636, USA.']",['eng'],"['K99 HL091061/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 HL091061/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM061774/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA139244/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139244/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM061774-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 091061/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110211,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE7B protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3111850,2010/12/02 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25785 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Sep 1;129(5):1162-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25785.

The microscopic human papillomavirus-positive SCC involving the tonsillar surface and crypts was obscured by SLL leading to the initial designation of 'unknown primary'. The occult HNSCC are likely explained by small tumor size, quality and quantity of sampling, thoroughness of endoscopic, radiological and pathological assessment or a combination of the above. The coexistence of another tumor such as lymphoma has not yet been reported as a confounding factor in the workup for cervical SCC metastasis.

An immunoblot analysis was performed and an in vitro study of the cytotoxicity of three NK-1 receptor antagonists (L-733,060, L-732,138, aprepitant) was carried out on both cell lines. NK-1 receptors were found in those cell lines, and both expressed mRNA for this receptor. Using a knockdown method, we demonstrate that NK-1 receptors are involved in the viability of tumor cells. TAC1R cDNA was detected in the ALL cell lines by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. We also observed that the three NK-1 receptor antagonists elicited the inhibition of ALL cell growth; that the specific antitumor action of the NK-1 receptor antagonists occurs through the NK-1 receptor, and that ALL cell death is due to apoptosis.

This mechanism of action has been shown to mediate sensitization to chlorambucil in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To evaluate this effect in vivo, we performed a phase I study of chlorambucil combined with imatinib in relapsed CLL patients. METHODS: The three dose levels studied included imatinib at 300, 400, or 600 mg/day. Imatinib was given on days 1-10, and chlorambucil (8 mg/m(2) daily) was given on days 3-7 of a 28-day cycle (up to 6 cycles). RESULTS: Eleven patients participated in this study. Low-grade gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Forty-five percent of patients responded (two unconfirmed CRs and three PRs). Two responding patients were fludarabine refractory. The in vitro IC(50) of chlorambucil alone or in the presence of 5 muM imatinib in CLL lymphocytes correlated with the decrease in lymphocyte counts on day 15. Imatinib plasma concentrations achieved in patients were in the range of those effective in in vitro sensitization studies. CONCLUSION: The combination of chlorambucil and imatinib in patients with previously treated CLL was well tolerated and showed evidence of clinical efficacy. Based on our results, we recommend the 400 mg daily dose of imatinib on days 1-10 with 8 mg/m(3) chlorambucil on days 3-7 every 28 days as the phase II dose.

Both AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may develop after treatment for primary cancer. Topoisomerase inhibitors are commonly used to treat breast cancer patients and are well-known for their effect on leukemogenesis of therapy-related acute leukemias (t-AL). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated bone marrow test results, chromosomal findings, and clinical characteristics of 12 patients who received topoisomerase inhibitors for breast cancer treatment and later developed acute leukemia. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (0.2%) developed t-AL after treatment for breast cancer. Topoisomerase inhibitors were administered to 12 patients. Among them, 9 patients (75%, 9/12) were diagnosed with therapy-related AML (t-AML) and 3 patients (25%, 3/12) with therapy-related ALL (t-ALL). Eight patients (67%, 8/12) showed translocation involving 11q23 and 3 different partner genes, 19p13.1 (37.5%, 3/8), 9p22 (37.5%, 3/8), and 4q21 (25%, 2/8). The median interval between completion of chemotherapy for breast cancer and occurrence of t-AL was 25 months.

However, FISH performed in addition to G-banded karyotype can be labor-intensive and expensive. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH gives additional information in the setting of adequate conventional cytogenetics in cases of hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from 135 patients at diagnosis (56 AML, 32 MDS, 20 ALL, and 27 MM) between 2005 and 2010. Interphase FISH was performed using the following probes: BCR/ABL1, AML1/ETO, PML/RARA, CBFB, MLL, EGR1, CEP8, and D7S486 for AML; CEP8, D20S108, EGR1, and D7S486 for MDS; BCR/ABL1, MLL, CDKN2A (p16), ETV6, and 6q21/c-myc for ALL; IgH, TP53, D13S25, IgH/CCND1, IgH/MAF, IgH/FGFR3, and 1q21/8p21 for MM. We compared the results of FISH with the corresponding aberrations identified by G-banded karyotype. RESULTS: Additional genetic aberrations detected by FISH (which were not identified by G-banded karyotype) were 4%, 9%, 50%, and 67% in AML, MDS, ALL, and MM, respectively. In ALL, CDKN2A and ETV6 FISH revealed additional genetic aberrations in 33% and 28% of cases, respectively. In MM, FISH was of benefit in detecting IgH, D13S25, TP53, and 1q21 rearrangements, not detected by G-banded karyotype (31%, 36%, 20%, and 40%, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that performing FISH in addition to G-banded karyotype may contribute little additional genetic information in AML and MDS, whereas routine FISH analysis appears to be an efficient screening method in ALL and MM.",,"['Kwon, Won Kyung', 'Lee, Jin Young', 'Mun, Yeung Chul', 'Seong, Chu Myong', 'Chung, Wha Soon', 'Huh, Jungwon']","['Kwon WK', 'Lee JY', 'Mun YC', 'Seong CM', 'Chung WS', 'Huh J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100930,Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,PMC2983032,2010/12/02 06:00,2010/12/02 06:01,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2010.45.3.171 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2010 Sep;45(3):171-6. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2010.45.3.171.

Although many factors that cause drug resistance in leukemic cells have been studied, the effect of hypoxia on drug-induced apoptosis is still poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, we examined the effect of hypoxia on anti-leukemic drug resistance in leukemic cell lines treated with cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), a hypoxia-mimetic agent. Cellular proliferation was evaluated using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Flow cytometry analysis and western blots were performed to investigate apoptosis-related proteins. RESULTS: Unlike its previously known apoptotic effect, the expression of HIF-1alpha increased the survival rate of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells when these cells were exposed to anti-leukemic drugs; these effects were mediated by heat-shock protein HSP70 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.

RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 39.75 months. The BuFlu group showed a lower incidence of mucositis (P=0.005), but there was no significant intergroup difference in the time of engraftment, nausea/vomiting, acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, or hemorrhagic cystitis. Moreover, the 2 groups showed no significant difference in the cumulative risk of relapse, event-free survival, or overall survival.

In this paper, we report a rare case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapsed as a granulocytic sarcoma of the donor type. The patient was diagnosed as having AML and underwent an allo-HSCT from his matched sibling donor. Fifty-seven months after allo-HSCT, he developed granulocytic sarcomas of duodenum, jejunum, and left sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. The bone marrow was normal with 100% donor chimerism.

Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, has been used in patients in whom supportive therapy failed to resolve ACPO. Here, we report the results of administering neostigmine to treat ACPO in children with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Between September 2005 and December 2009, 10 patients (8 male and 2 female) were diagnosed with ACPO at the Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of Korea. Diagnosis of ACPO was based on typical clinical features as well as colonic dilatation found on abdominal CT imaging. Neostigmine was administered subcutaneously at a dosage of 0.01 mg/kg/dose (maximum 0.5 mg) twice daily for a maximum of 5 total doses. ACPO was determined to be responsive to neostigmine if the patient showed both stool passage and improvement of clinical symptoms. RESULTS: The study group included 8 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, 1 patient with malignant lymphoma, and 1 patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The median age at ACPO diagnosis was 8.5 years (range, 3-14). Overall, 8 patients (80%) showed therapeutic response to neostigmine at a median of 29 hours after the initial administration (range, 1-70). Two patients (20%) showed side effects of grade 2 or above, but none complained of cardiovascular symptoms that required treatment. CONCLUSION: In this study, ACPO was diagnosed most often in late-childhood ALL patients. Subcutaneous neostigmine can be used to effectively treat ACPO diagnosed in children with hematologic malignancies without major cardiovascular complications.",,"['Lee, Jae-Wook', 'Bang, Kyong-Won', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nak-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Kim, Hack-Ki', 'Im, Soo-Ah', 'Lim, Gye-Yeon']","['Lee JW', 'Bang KW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Jeong DC', 'Kim HK', 'Im SA', 'Lim GY']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100331,Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,PMC2983008,2010/12/02 06:00,2010/12/02 06:01,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2010.45.1.62 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2010 Mar;45(1):62-5. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2010.45.1.62.

This mutation occurs less frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other hematologic diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); myelodysplatic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U); and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with thrombocytosis (RARS-T). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with hematologic diseases other than MPN who visited Seoul St Mary's Hospital from January 2007 to February 2010 were selected. A total of 43 patients were enrolled in this study: 12 MDS, 9 MDS/MPN-U, 7 RARS-T, and 15 AML patients. The diseases were diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO classification criteria. Data obtained from JAK2 V617F mutation analysis and cytogenetic study as well as complete blood count and clinical data were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 43 patients, 6 (13.9%) harbored the JAK2 V617F mutation. The incidence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in each patient group was as follows: 8.3% (1/12), MDS; 22.2% (2/9), MDS/MPN-U; 14.3% (1/7), RARS-T; and 13.3%, (2/15) AML. The platelet count was higher than 450x10(9)/L in 3 of the 6 patients (50%) harboring the JAK2 V617F mutation, and it was in the normal range in the remaining 3 patients. Among the 6 patients, 1 MDS and 1 MDS/MPN-U patients had the 46,XX,del(20)(q11.2) karyotype. CONCLUSION: The JAK2 V617F mutation is associated with an increased platelet count in MDS, MDS/MPN-U, RARS-T, and AML patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities of del(20)(q11.2) occurred in 1/3 of patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation but further studies are required to confirm this association.",,"['Jekarl, Dong Wook', 'Han, Sang Bong', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Oh, Eun-Jee', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Han, Kyungja']","['Jekarl DW', 'Han SB', 'Kim M', 'Lim J', 'Oh EJ', 'Kim Y', 'Kim HJ', 'Min WS', 'Han K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20100331,Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,PMC2983014,2010/12/02 06:00,2010/12/02 06:01,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2010.45.1.46 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2010 Mar;45(1):46-50. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2010.45.1.46.

We analyzed the prognostic impact of these mutations and their interactions in adults with CN-AML. METHODS: NPM1 mutation (NPM1mut) and FLT3-ITD mutation (FLT3-ITD+) were analyzed by GeneScan and PCR assays of bone marrow samples obtained from 121 adult patients with CN-AML (age</=60 years at diagnosis). RESULTS: The incidence of FLT3-ITD+ was higher in the NPM1mut group than in the wild-type NPM1 gene (NPM1wt) group. The patients were divided according to their mutation status into the NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD (isolated NPM1mut), NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-, and NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD+ (isolated FLT3-ITD+) groups. The isolated NPM1mut group showed significantly better clinical outcomes in terms of relapse rate, 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) than the other groups. In contrast, the isolated FLT3-ITD+ group had a higher relapse rate and shorter RFS and OS than the other groups. The 5-year RFS rate was much higher among the patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) than among those treated with high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy (HDAC) only as consolidation therapy in the isolated NPM1mut group and the NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD- group. CONCLUSION: Adult patients with CN-AML carrying isolated NPM1mut and isolated FLT3-ITD+ exhibit different clinical outcomes than those with NPM1mut/FLT3-ITD+ or NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-.

Interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in particular, control the degeneration of articular cartilage matrix, which makes them prime targets for therapeutic strategies. Animal studies provide support for this approach, although only a few clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of blocking these proinflammatory cytokines in the treatment of OA. Apart from IL-1beta and TNF, several other cytokines including IL-6, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-8 (a chemokine) have also been shown to be implicated in OA and could possibly be targeted therapeutically.

However, when saturation of antibody binding sites is important, this assumption might not be justified. Residual antibody and different amounts of administered antibody may lead to a considerably altered therapeutic biodistribution. In this study we developed a method based on serum activity measurements to investigate this effect in radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-labelled anti-CD66 antibody. Pretherapeutic and therapeutic serum activity data of ten patients with acute leukaemia were fitted to a set of four parsimonious pharmacokinetic models. All models included the key mechanisms of antibody binding, immunoreactivity and degradation; however, they differed with respect to linear or nonlinear binding and global or individual fitting of the model parameters. The empirically most supported model was chosen according to the corrected Akaike information criterion. The nonlinear models were most supported by the data (sum of probabilities approximately 100%). Using the presented method, we identified relevant saturable binding for radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-labelled anti-CD66 antibody solely based on serum data.

The inflammatory environment inside recipients is critical for GVHD pathogenesis, but the underpinning mechanisms remain elusive. Using mouse model of human GVHD, we demonstrate osteopontin (OPN), a potent proinflammatory cytokine, plays an important role in regulating activation, migration, and survival of alloreactive T cells during GVHD. OPN was significantly elevated after irradiation and persisted throughout the course of GVHD. Blockade of OPN attenuated GVHD with reduced accumulation of donor T cells in recipient organs. Amelioration was the result of migration and survival suppression caused by anti-OPN treatment on donor-derived T cells for 2 reasons. First, OPN promoted the migration and infiltration of naive and alloreactive CD8(+) T cells into host organs. Second, it also facilitated activation and viability of donor-derived CD8(+) T cells via synergizing with T-cell receptor/CD3 signaling. Finally, anti-OPN treatment retained graft-versus-leukemia effect of alloreactive CD8(+) T cells. This study demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, the critical effect of OPN in the initiation and persistence of CD8(+) T cell-mediated GVHD and validates OPN as a potential target in GVHD prevention.",,"['Zhao, Fang', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Wang, Hao', 'Jin, Min', 'He, Shan', 'Shi, Yufang', 'Guo, Yajun', 'Zhang, Yanyun']","['Zhao F', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang H', 'Jin M', 'He S', 'Shi Y', 'Guo Y', 'Zhang Y']","['Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 225 South Chongqing Road, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101130,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Osteopontin/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3056597,2010/12/02 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)60122-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-281659 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Feb 3;117(5):1723-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-281659.

Although several molecular components required for this process have been identified, the mechanism of proteasome-dependent degradation of OMM-associated proteins is currently unclear. We show that an AAA-ATPase, p97, is required for the proteasomal degradation of Mcl1 and Mfn1, two unrelated OMM proteins with short half-lives. A number of biochemical assays, as well as imaging of changes in localization of photoactivable GFP-fused Mcl1, revealed that p97 regulates the retrotranslocation of Mcl1 from mitochondria to the cytosol, prior to, or concurrent with, proteasomal degradation. Mcl1 retrotranslocation from the OMM depends on the activity of the ATPase domain of p97. Furthermore, p97-mediated retrotranslocation of Mcl1 can be recapitulated in vitro, confirming a direct mitochondrial role for p97.

The chromosomal translocation t(2;11)(p21;q23) found in patients with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia leads to an overexpression of miR-125b of up to 90-fold normal. Moreover, miR-125b is also up-regulated in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying the t(11;14)(q24;q32) translocation. To decipher the presumed oncogenic mechanism of miR-125b, we used transplantation experiments in mice. All mice transplanted with fetal liver cells ectopically expressing miR-125b showed an increase in white blood cell count, in particular in neutrophils and monocytes, associated with a macrocytic anemia. Among these mice, half died of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or a myeloproliferative neoplasm, suggesting an important role for miR-125b in early hematopoiesis. Furthermore, coexpression of miR-125b and the BCR-ABL fusion gene in transplanted cells accelerated the development of leukemia in mice, compared with control mice expressing only BCR-ABL, suggesting that miR-125b confers a proliferative advantage to the leukemic cells.

Our data showed that c-CBL protein was considerably up-regulated by arsenic sulfide (As(4)S(4)).

Sp100 is a prototypical protein of ND10/PML nuclear bodies, which colocalizes with Daxx and the proto-oncogenic PML. Sp100 isoforms contain SAND, PHD, Bromo, and HMG domains and are highly sumoylated, all characteristics suggestive of a role in chromatin-mediated gene regulation. A role for Sp100 in oncogenesis has not been defined previously. Using selective Sp100 isoform-knockdown approaches, we show that normal human diploid fibroblasts with reduced Sp100 levels rapidly senesce. Subsequently, small rapidly dividing Sp100 minus cells emerge from the senescing fibroblasts and are found to be highly tumorigenic in nude mice. The derivation of these tumorigenic cells from the parental fibroblasts is confirmed by microsatellite analysis. The small rapidly dividing Sp100 minus cells now also lack ND10/PML bodies, and exhibit genomic instability and p53 cytoplasmic sequestration. They have also activated MYC, RAS, and TERT pathways and express mesenchymal to epithelial transdifferentiation (MET) markers. Reintroduction of expression of only the Sp100A isoform is sufficient to maintain senescence and to inhibit emergence of the highly tumorigenic cells. Global transcriptome studies, quantitative PCR, and protein studies, as well as immunolocalization studies during the course of the transformation, reveal that a transient expression of stem cell markers precedes the malignant transformation. These results identify a role for Sp100 as a tumor suppressor in addition to its role in maintaining ND10/PML bodies and in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.",,"['Negorev, Dmitri G', 'Vladimirova, Olga V', 'Kossenkov, Andrew V', 'Nikonova, Elena V', 'Demarest, Renee M', 'Capobianco, Anthony J', 'Showe, Michael K', 'Rauscher, Frank J 3rd', 'Showe, Louise C', 'Maul, Gerd G']","['Negorev DG', 'Vladimirova OV', 'Kossenkov AV', 'Nikonova EV', 'Demarest RM', 'Capobianco AJ', 'Showe MK', 'Rauscher FJ 3rd', 'Showe LC', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI041136-07/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064691-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI041136-09A2/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024693/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 132098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041136-08/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM064691-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009171-35/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD034612/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009171-34/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 34612/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024693-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'GM57599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132098-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20101130,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*genetics/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3059726,2010/12/02 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1483 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1483 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Dec 1;70(23):9991-10001. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1483.

Damaged senescent cells permanently arrest growth, secrete inflammatory cytokines and other proteins and harbor persistent nuclear foci that contain DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. To understand how persistent damage foci differ from transient foci that mark repairable DNA lesions, we identify sequential events that differentiate transient foci from persistent foci, which we term 'DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence' (DNA-SCARS). Unlike transient foci, DNA-SCARS associate with PML nuclear bodies, lack the DNA repair proteins RPA and RAD51, lack single-stranded DNA and DNA synthesis and accumulate activated forms of the DDR mediators CHK2 and p53. DNA-SCARS form independently of p53, pRB and several other checkpoint and repair proteins but require p53 and pRb to trigger the senescence growth arrest. Importantly, depletion of the DNA-SCARS-stabilizing component histone H2AX did not deplete 53BP1 from DNA-SCARS but diminished the presence of MDC1 and activated CHK2. Furthermore, depletion of H2AX reduced both the p53-dependent senescence growth arrest and p53-independent cytokine secretion. DNA-SCARS were also observed following severe damage to multiple human cell types and mouse tissues, suggesting that they can be used in combination with other markers to identify senescent cells. Thus, DNA-SCARS are dynamically formed distinct structures that functionally regulate multiple aspects of the senescent phenotype.",,"['Rodier, Francis', 'Munoz, Denise P', 'Teachenor, Robert', 'Chu, Victoria', 'Le, Oanh', 'Bhaumik, Dipa', 'Coppe, Jean-Philippe', 'Campeau, Eric', 'Beausejour, Christian M', 'Kim, Sahn-Ho', 'Davalos, Albert R', 'Campisi, Judith']","['Rodier F', 'Munoz DP', 'Teachenor R', 'Chu V', 'Le O', 'Bhaumik D', 'Coppe JP', 'Campeau E', 'Beausejour CM', 'Kim SH', 'Davalos AR', 'Campisi J']","['Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['AG09909/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG025708/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AG017242/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG025708/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'MPO79317/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'AG17242/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AG009909/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20101130,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Cellular Senescence/*radiation effects', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'X-Rays']",PMC3001408,2010/12/02 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.071340 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.071340 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Jan 1;124(Pt 1):68-81. doi: 10.1242/jcs.071340.

However, its role in pathogenesis of lung cancer is still unclear. The objective of this study is to assess expression and clinical significance of PML, P53 and P16INK4A in lung cancer, as well as the relation of these factors. METHODS: The tissue microarrays were created with samples from lung cancers (n=148), pulmonary benign lung tumors (n=5) and normal lung tissues (n=7), and protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The association between protein expression and clinical parameters was evaluated by using Crosstabs method. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There was at least triplicate 0.6-mm cores per sample, 4 cases of lung cancer were excluded for lacking of enough tissue. PML was found in the cytoplasm of 14.0% cases of NSCLC and of 39.1% SCLC (P=0.010), and in the nuclei of 31.4% NSCLC and 8.7% SCLC respectively (P=0.026). PML protein was present in 9 patients with SCLC and absent in 14 cases, 5-year cumulative survival rate of the patients was 50% and 23% respectively (Log-rank test, P=0.047). Lacking of PML protein and senior pathologic T-stage were two hazardous factors that influenced prognosis of SCLC. P53 expression was found in 33.3% lung cancer, and absent in benign tumors and normal tissues of the lung (P=0.038). P16INK4A expression was abolished in normal lung tissue, however, increased in lung cancer (28.5%), and especially in lung cancer with non- or poor differentiation (36.5%) and in SCLC (69.6%). There was inverse correlation between PML expression in the nuclei and P16INK4A expression, positive correlation between P53 and P16INK4A expressions in lung cancers. PML was negatively correlated with P53 in squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: As an important suppressor of tumor, PML is related with P53 mutation in squamous cell carcinoma. Increased P16INK4A protein in lung cancer may be the results of gene mutation, and be related with mutant P53 protein.",,"['Zhao, Zhilong', 'Huang, Qingyuan', 'Zhao, Tingzhang', 'Zhao, Jun']","['Zhao Z', 'Huang Q', 'Zhao T', 'Zhao J']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, First Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, P.R.China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer,101126433,,,,,2007/06/20 00:00,2007/06/20 00:01,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/20 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2007.03.04 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi. 2007 Jun 20;10(3):176-82. doi: 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2007.03.04.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most, but not all, isolates have typical xenotropic or polytropic host range, and these two MLV tropism types have now been detected in humans as viral sequences or as infectious virus, termed XMRV, or xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus. The mouse xenotropic MLVs (X-MLVs) were originally defined by their inability to infect cells of their natural mouse hosts. It is now clear, however, that X-MLVs actually have the broadest host range of the MLVs. Nearly all nonrodent mammals are susceptible to X-MLVs, and all species of wild mice and several common strains of laboratory mice are X-MLV susceptible. The polytropic MLVs, named for their apparent broad host range, show a more limited host range than the X-MLVs in that they fail to infect cells of many mouse species as well as many nonrodent mammals.

However, its function has not been characterised to date. Here we hypothesized that ccp1 may be a downstream effecter of FGF2, promoting cell proliferation and protecting from apoptosis. METHODS: Forced ccp1 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line, as well as down-regulation of ccp1 expression by siRNA in NIH3T3, was used to characterize the role of ccp1. RESULTS: Ccp1 over-expression increased cell proliferation, whereas down-regulation of ccp1 expression reduced it. Ccp1 was able to increase cell proliferation in the absence of serum. Furthermore, ccp1 reduced apoptosis upon withdrawal of serum in SK-N-SH. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or ERK Kinase (MEK) inhibitor, U0126, only partially inhibited the ccp1-dependent BrdU incorporation, indicating that other signaling pathway may be involved in ccp1-induced cell proliferation. Induction of Sprouty (SPRY) upon FGF2 treatment was accelerated in ccp1 over-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: All together, the results showed that ccp1 regulates cell number by promoting proliferation and suppressing cell death. FGF2 was shown to enhance the effects of ccp1, however, it is likely that other mitogenic factors present in the serum can also enhance the effects. Whether these effects are mediated by FGF2 influencing the ccp1 function or by increasing the ccp1 expression level is still unclear. At least some of the proliferative regulation by ccp1 is mediated by MAPK, however other signaling pathways are likely to be involved.",,"['Pellicano, Francesca', 'Thomson, Rachel E', 'Inman, Gareth J', 'Iwata, Tomoko']","['Pellicano F', 'Thomson RE', 'Inman GJ', 'Iwata T']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. fp23k@clinmed.gla.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101130,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Ccdc115 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (U 0126)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",PMC3001724,2010/12/02 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-657 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-657 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Nov 30;10:657. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-657.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The periodontal pathogens produce virulence factors with capacity to affect the host immune response. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a periodontal pathogen that produces a leukotoxin that specifically affects human leukocytes. The aims of the present study were to examine the presence and function of systemic antibodies to the leukotoxin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven middle-aged (57 +/- 5 years) Swedes with well-documented periodontal status and medical factors related to cardiovascular diseases were studied. These data have been published previously. The serum samples were examined for the presence of leukotoxin antibodies by western blot and the capacity to neutralize leukotoxicity in an activity assay with leukotoxin and cultured leukemic cells. RESULTS: The results showed a high prevalence (57%) of antibodies against A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin in the analyzed population. These antibodies were correlated with leukotoxin neutralizing capacity as well as with the ELISA titers of A. actinomycetemcomitans-specific IgA and IgG. In addition, high levels of leukotoxin antibodies were correlated with increasing age, but not with periodontal disease parameters or cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: Systemic antibodies against A. actionmycetemcomitans leukotoxin were common in this adult Swedish population.

Here, we undertook a combined crystallographic and structure-activity relationship analysis on ponatinib to understand this unique profile. While the ethynyl linker is a key inhibitor functionality that interacts with the gatekeeper, virtually all other components of ponatinib play an essential role in its T315I inhibitory activity.

Reduction of the beta-catenin levels in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines and patient samples decelerated their in vitro proliferation ability without affecting cell viability. Transplantation of leukaemic cells with control or reduced levels of beta-catenin in non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient animals indicated that, while the immediate homing of the cells was unaffected, the bone marrow engraftment was directly dependent on beta-catenin levels. Subsequent examination of bone sections revealed that beta-catenin was implicated in the localization of AML to the endosteum. Examination of adhesion molecule expression before and after transplantation, revealed down-regulation of CD44 expression, accompanied by reduced in vitro adhesion. Gene expression analysis disclosed the presence of an autocrine compensatory mechanism, which responds to the reduced beta-catenin levels by altering the expression of positive and negative pathway regulators.

This reviews discusses (i) the current situation in MLL-rearranged leukaemia, (ii) the molecular and genetic tools to functionally investigate the many different MLL fusions, (iii) the latency of disease development, (iv) a novel cancer mechanism that has been recently uncovered when different MLL fusion protein complexes were characterized, (v) mutated signalling pathways in MLL-rearranged leukaemia and (vi) presents new ideas on how a given MLL fusion protein may modulate existing signalling pathways in leukaemic cells. The hypothesis is posed that the many different fusion partners of MLL are critically distinct entities for which specific inhibitors should be identified in the future.",['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],"['Marschalek, Rolf']",['Marschalek R'],"['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/Diagnostic Centre of Acute Leukaemia, Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. rolf.marschalek@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20101201,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,2010/12/02 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/12/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08459.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Jan;152(2):141-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08459.x.

However, primary and secondary failures after immunosuppressive therapy remain frequent, and to date all attempts aiming to overcome this problem have been unfruitful. This article reviews the state of the art of current immunosuppressive therapies for AA, focusing on open questions linked to standard immunosuppressive treatment, and on experimental immunosuppressive strategies which could lead to future improvement of current treatments.

Although transcriptional control of Bcl2 has been reported, increasing evidence suggests an important component of Bcl2 regulation is post-transcriptional. Phosphorylation of Bcl2 has been shown to enhance activity to allow response to extracellular growth-factor-mediated signals. Bcl2 mRNA contains regulatory elements in both its 5'- and 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions). An IRES (internal ribosome entry sequence) in the 5'-UTR permits continued translation in the presence of cellular stresses that reduce cap-dependent translation. The 3'-UTR of Bcl2 mRNA is 5.2 kb in length and contains multiple predicted miRNA (microRNA) and RNA-BP (RNA-binding protein)-binding sites. miR-15a and miR-16-1 have been found to inhibit Bcl2 expression in B-cells, whereas the RNA-BP nucleolin has been shown to increase Bcl2 expression by binding to the 3'-UTR and enhancing mRNA stability. Both decreased expression of miR-15a and miR-16-1 and increased nucleolin have been shown to be associated with increased Bcl2 expression and resistance to apoptosis in the common human disease, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. miRNA-based therapeutic approaches to treat cancer are emerging.

Recently, many studies have examined factors influencing both the susceptibility to ALL and the metabolism of widely used chemotherapeutic agents.

Thirty-five children with ALL and 48 healthy adults of Cretan origin were genotyped for the presence of the MTHFR 677 and 1298 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The possible correlation of the polymorphisms with the risk for ALL and the presence of methotrexate-induced toxicities were examined. No significant association between the MTHFR genotypes and the susceptibility to ALL was observed. A borderline statistically significant relationship was detected after methotrexate administration, between the C677T genotype (polymorphisms) and leukopenia (p = 0.050) and between the A1298C polymorphism and normal aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase values (p = 0.065 and p = 0.053, respectively), which was strengthened for aspartate transaminase, after grouping the A1298A and A1298C genotypes together (p = 0.039).

The role of MLL3 in breast cancer, however, remains unknown. In this study, we sequenced all 59 exons of MLL3 (14.7 Kb coding sequence) in 38 breast cancers from Chinese women, and found three somatic mutations in two of the cases, including one frameshift mutation (c.2687 ins A) that truncates the majority of the MLL3 protein, and two synonymous mutations. In addition to 24 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 5 novel SNPs were also detected in the 38 women; and interestingly, all the 5 novel SNPs alter amino acid sequences of MLL3 thus could have functional consequences. We also examined the expression of MLL3 mRNA in 30 breast tumors and their matched normal breast tissues. While no associations were found between expression change and clinicopathologic parameters, 40% of the samples showed reduced expression in cancer tissues.

The apoptotic cell death induced by the various strains could be distinguished by the role of caspase activation and sensitivity to the recently detected chemotherapy-resistance-associated prosurvival protein LEDGF/p75. One strain (M44) was particularly promising since its activity counteracted the protective effect of LEDGF/p75 overexpressed in AML cells, acted synergistically with the anthracycline anticancer drug daunorubicin in AML cells, and protected cardiomyoblasts against the toxic effect of anthracyclines.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) regulate the acetylation of histones as well as other non-histone protein targets. Treatment with HDACIs results in chromatin remodeling that permits re-expression of silenced tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells, which, in turn, can potentially result in cellular differentiation, inhibition of proliferation and/or apoptosis. Several classes of HDACIs are currently under development for the treatment of patients with MDS and AML. Although modest clinical activity has been reported with the use of HDACIs as single-agent therapy, marked responses have been observed in selected subsets of patients. More importantly, HDACIs appear to be synergistic in vitro and improve response rates in vivo when combined with other agents, such as hypomethylating agents. Furthermore, HDACIs are also being investigated in combination with non-epigenetic therapies.

Continuous overexpression of HOXA10 is required to generate AML in primary recipient mice, but is not essential for maintenance of the leukemia. Transplantation of AML to secondary recipients showed that in established leukemias, approximately 80% of the leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in bone marrow stopped proliferating upon withdrawal of HOXA10 overexpression. However, the population of LICs in primary recipients is heterogeneous, as approximately 20% of the LICs induce leukemia in secondary recipients despite elimination of HOXA10-induced overexpression. Intrinsic genetic activation of several proto-oncogenes was observed in leukemic cells resistant to inactivation of the initial transformation event. Interestingly, high levels of the adhesion molecule CD44 on leukemic cells are essential to generate leukemia after removal of the primary event.

To develop more suitable treatment strategies, a firm understanding of the biology underlying this disease is of utmost importance. MLL-rearranged ALL displays a unique gene expression profile, partly explained by erroneous histone modifications. We recently showed that t(4;11)-positive infant ALL is also characterized by pronounced promoter CpG hypermethylation. In this study, we investigated whether this widespread hypermethylation also affected microRNA (miRNA) expression. We identified 11 miRNAs that were downregulated in t(4;11)-positive infant ALL as a consequence of CpG hypermethylation. Seven of these miRNAs were re-activated after exposure to the de-methylating agent Zebularine. Interestingly, five of these miRNAs are associated either with MLL or MLL fusions, and for miR-152 we found both MLL and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as potential targeted genes. Finally, a high degree of methylation of the miR-152 CpG island was strongly correlated with a poor clinical outcome. Our data suggests that inhibitors of methylation have a potential beyond re-expression of hypermethylated protein-coding genes in t(4;11)-positive infant ALL.

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENT: A 6-yr-old boy with acute myeloid leukemia and prolonged mechanical ventilatory support. INTERVENTIONS: Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxia secondary to nosocomial pneumonia. On day 2 of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run and every day thereafter, blood cultures were consistently positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia despite combination therapy with intravenous polymyxin B and cotrimoxazole. Excluding the cannulae, the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit was electively changed once during the run but without any effect on bacteremia. After 38 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the patient was successfully decannulated and the bacteremia ceased. He remains completely well and disease-free at 6-month follow-up.

In response to BCR activation, CLL cells secrete the chemokine CCL3, which fosters interactions between CLL cells and the leukemia microenvironment. CCL3 secretion correlates with expression of the 70-kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) and responsiveness of the CLL clone to BCR stimulation. Here, we measured CCL3 plasma levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 351 CLL patients and examined CCL3 levels for associations with established prognostic markers and time from diagnosis to initial therapy. We found that CCL3 plasma concentrations were strongly associated with established prognostic markers. In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, CCL3 as well as established prognostic markers (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable-region mutation status, CD38 or ZAP-70 cytogenetics, clinical stage) were significantly associated with time to treatment. Multivariable analysis revealed that CCL3 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.33, P < .0001), advanced clinical stage (HR = 2.75, P = .0025), poor risk cytogenetics (del 17p, HR = 2.38; del11q, HR = 2.36, P = .001), and CD38 expression (HR = 1.43, P = .023) were independent prognostic markers. Collectively, CCL3 is a novel, robust, and independent prognostic marker in CLL that can easily and reliably be measured by ELISA.

We investigated the function of the p53 axis in primary CLL samples by studying p53 and p21 responses to irradiation by FACS and RT-PCR. We observed a distinct response pattern for most cases with a 17p deletion (n = 16) or a sole TP53 mutation (n = 8), but not all cases with a p53 aberration were detected based on a number of different assays used. Samples with a small clone with a TP53 mutation remained undetected in all assays. Only 1 of 123 cases showed high expression of p53, which is suggestive of p53 aberration without proof of mutation of TP53. Samples with an 11q deletion showed a heterogeneous response, with only 13 of 30 showing an abnormal response based on cutoff. Nevertheless, the overall induction of p53 and p21 was impaired, suggesting a gene-dosage effect for ATM in the 11q-deleted samples. The detectability of p53 defects is influenced by clonal heterogeneity and sample purity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study evaluated the effects of co-treatment with LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and apigenin (a CK2 inhibitor) (LY/Api) at subtoxic concentrations on leukaemia cell lines and primary AML cells. RESULTS: LY/Api synergistically induced apoptosis in leukaemia cells, especially CD34(+)CD38(-) leukaemia cells. However, these effects were negligible in HSCs. LY/Api-induced apoptosis was accompanied by activation of caspase cascades and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase inhibitor or Akt overexpression abrogated this synergistic induction in apoptosis by LY/Api. LY/Api also led to remarkable down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-xL and NF-kappaB in CD34(+)CD38(-) leukaemia cells, but not in healthy hematopoietic stem cells.

We observed previously that depletion of dendritic cells (DCs) in CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mice followed by infection with cell-free virus led to greater proviral and Tax mRNA loads and diminished cellular immune response compared with mice infected with cell-associated virus. To understand the significance of these in vivo results and explore the host-pathogen interaction between DCs and cell-free HTLV-1, we used FLT3 ligand-cultured mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (FL-DCs) and chimeric HTLV-1. Phenotypically, the FL-DCs upregulated expression of surface markers (CD80, CD86, and MHC class II) on infection; however, the level of MHC class I remained unchanged. We performed kinetic studies to understand viral entry, proviral integration, and expression of the viral protein Tax. Multiplex cytokine profiling revealed production of an array of proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 IFN (IFN-alpha) by FL-DCs treated with virus. Virus-matured FL-DCs stimulated proliferation of autologous CD3(+) T cells as shown by intracellular nuclear Ki67 staining and produced IFN-gamma when cultured with infected FL-DCs. Gene expression studies using type 1 IFN-specific and DC-specific arrays revealed upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes, most cytokines, and transcription factors, but a distinct downregulation of many chemokines.

Culture-induced alterations of mRNA levels were found for progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor(alpha), leukemia inhibitory factor and cyclooxygenase-2 in tissues from all cycle stages. The suitability of the model to detect chemical effects was demonstrated by the down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA by chlormadinone acetate in proliferative and secretory endometrium.

In such cases, low concentrations of resveratrol enhanced tumor cell proliferation whereas higher concentrations were inhibitory. Similar resveratrol-induced biphasic dose responses were seen with several parasitic diseases, including Leishmaniasis and trichinella. Hormetic effects were also reported in animal models for cardiovascular induced injury, gastric lesions, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis. In these cases, there was often a protective effect at low doses but an adverse effect at higher doses, exacerbating the disease process/incidence. This analysis indicates that many effects induced by resveratrol are dependent on dose and that opposite effects occur at low and high doses, being indicative of a hormetic dose response.

Of multiple known central nervous system scar associated axon growth inhibitors, semaphorin 3A has been shown to be strongly expressed by invading leptomeningeal fibroblasts. We have previously demonstrated that infusion of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin results in major suppression of several growth inhibitory chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans and growth of adult sensory axons across acute spinal cord injuries. Furthermore, decorin treatment of leptomeningeal fibroblasts significantly increases their ability to support neurite growth of co-cultured adult dorsal root ganglion neurons. In the present study we show that decorin has the ability to suppress semaphorin 3A expression within adult rat cerebral cortex scar tissue and in primary leptomeningeal fibroblasts in vitro. Infusion of decorin core protein for eight days resulted in a significant reduction of semaphorin 3A messenger RNA expression within injury sites compared with saline-treated control animals. Both in situ hybridization and immunostaining confirmed that semaphorin 3A messenger RNA expression and protein levels are significantly reduced in decorin-treated animals. Similarly, decorin treatment decreased the expression of semaphorin 3A messenger RNA in cultured rat leptomeningeal fibroblasts compared with untreated cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that decorin-mediated suppression of semaphorin 3A critically depends on erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue B4 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 function. Collectively, our studies show that in addition to suppressing the levels of inhibitory chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, decorin has the ability to suppress semaphorin 3A in the injured central nervous system. Our findings provide further evidence for the use of decorin as a potential therapy for promoting axonal growth and repair in the injured adult mammalian brain and spinal cord.",,"['Minor, Kenneth H', 'Bournat, Juan C', 'Toscano, Nicole', 'Giger, Roman J', 'Davies, Stephen J A']","['Minor KH', 'Bournat JC', 'Toscano N', 'Giger RJ', 'Davies SJ']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Colorado at Denver, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",['eng'],['7NS047333/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20101128,England,Brain,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537,"['0 (Decorin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Semaphorin-3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb4 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cicatrix/*metabolism', 'Decorin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Nerve Regeneration/physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, ErbB-4', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Semaphorin-3A/*metabolism']",PMC3069700,2010/12/01 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2010/12/01 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['awq304 [pii]', '10.1093/brain/awq304 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain. 2011 Apr;134(Pt 4):1140-55. doi: 10.1093/brain/awq304.

The GI(50) values for eighteen of the compounds were below 10 muM in at least one cell line. Two cancer cells (MCF-7 and HT-29) proved to be the most sensitive to five compounds (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b and 5b), with growth inhibition in the nanomolar range, and compounds 1b, 3b, 7b, 8b and 9b gave values of less than 1 muM. In addition, all of the aforementioned compounds exhibited lower GI(50) values than some of the standard chemotherapeutic drugs used as references. The results also reveal that the nature of the aliphatic chain (methyl is better than benzyl) at the selenium position and the nature of the heteroatom (Se better than S) have a marked influence on the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. These findings reinforce our earlier hypothesis concerning the determinant role of the selenomethyl group as a scaffold for the biological activity of this type of compound. Considering both the cytotoxic parameters and the selectivity index (which was compared in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells), compounds 2b and 8b (with a selenomethyl moiety) displayed the best profiles, with GI(50) values ranging from 0.34 nM to 6.07 muM in the five cell lines tested. Therefore, compounds 2b and 8b were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis for their effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. 2b was the most active, with an apoptogenic effect similar to camptothecin, which was used as a positive control. Both of them provoked cell cycle arrest leading to the accumulation of cells in either G(2)/M and S phase.

The RBCC domain and the covalent modification of PML by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) are required for PML localization within the nuclear bodies (NBs). Analysis of PML(-/-) mice provided evidence for a physiological role of PML in apoptosis. Cells derived from these mice are defective in the induction of apoptosis by interferon (IFN). PML is expressed as a family of cytoplasmic and nuclear isoforms (PML I-VII) as a result of alternative splicing. Herein, we show that overexpression of all nuclear PML isoforms (I-VI) in human cells increased IFNgamma-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, resulting in higher binding of STAT1 to DNA, higher activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and an increase in the expression of their products. These effects, observed with IFNgamma and not IFNalpha, required PML localization in the nucleus as they were not observed with the cytoplasmic isoform PMLVIIb or the cytoplasmic variants of PMLIV. They also necessitated PML SUMOylation and its RING finger domain. Conversely, downregulation of PML by RNA interference was accompanied by decrease in IFNgamma-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, STAT1 DNA binding, transcription of ISGs and in the expression of their products. In addition, IFNgamma-mediated STAT1 DNA-binding activity was decreased in PML(-/-) MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs. Taken together these results demonstrate that PML functions as a positive regulator of IFNgamma signaling.",['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present study we investigated the influence of metformin on the in vitro anticancer activity of the well-known chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Cell viability was determined by MTT and LDH release assay, oxidative stress and apoptosis (caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine exposure) were assessed by flow cytometry, while activation of AMPK and Akt was analyzed by immunoblotting. Although metformin reduced the number of tumour cells when applied alone, it surprisingly antagonized the cytotoxicity of cisplatin towards U251 human glioma, C6 rat glioma, SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma, L929 mouse fibrosarcoma and HL-60 human leukemia cell lines. Only in B16 mouse melanoma cells metformin augmented the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. In U251 glioma cells metformin suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death through inhibition of oxidative stress and caspase activation. The observed cytoprotection was apparently AMPK-independent, as metformin did not further increase cisplatin-induced AMPK activation in U251 cells and other pharmacological AMPK activators failed to block cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, metformin induced Akt activation in cisplatin-treated cells and Akt inhibitor 10-DEBC hydrochloride or phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor LY294002 abolished metformin-mediated antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, the antidiabetic drug metformin reduces cisplatin in vitro anticancer activity through AMPK-independent upregulation of Akt survival pathway.

Leukemic cells can induce reversible changes in microenvironmental components, especially the stromal function which results in improved growth conditions for maintaining the malignant leukemic cells. This study aimed to investigate the survival advantage of leukemic cells over normal hematopoietic cells in stromal microenvironment in long term. METHODS: The mice were injected intraperitoneally with N-N' ethylnitrosourea (ENU) to induce leukemia; the mice received injection of normal saline were used as control. At 180 days after ENU induction, the mice were killed and the bone marrows were cultured for 19 days. Colony-forming assays were used to analyze the formation of various cell colonies. The expression of Sca-1, CD146, VEGFR2, CD95, pStat3, pStat5, and Bcl-xL in marrow cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Long-term leukemic bone marrow culture showed abnormal elongated stromal fibroblasts with almost absence of normal hematopoietic cells. Adherent cell colonies were increased, but CFU-F and other hematopoietic cell colonies were significantly decreased in leukemia group (P<0.001). Primitive progenitor-specific Sca-1 receptor expression was decreased with subsequent increased expression of CD146 and VEGFR-2 in leukemic bone marrow cells. Decreased Fas antigen expression with increased intracellular pStat3, pStat5 and Bcl-xL proteins were observed in leukemic bone marrow cells.

Effective progenitor cells are decreased in leukemia with increased leukemia-specific cell population.

METHODS: To investigate the effect of PHI, a novel histone deacetylases inhibitor (HDACi), on demethylation and activation of transcription of p15 in acute lymphoid leukemia cell line Molt-4, and to further decipher the potential mechanism of demethylation, DNA sequencing and modified methylation specific PCR (MSP) were used to screen p15-M and p15-U mRNA after Molt-4 cells were treated with PHI, 5-Aza and TSA. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), 3A (DNMT3A), 3B (DNMT3B) and p15 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR. P15 protein, acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 were detected by Western Blot. RESULTS: The gene p15 in Molt-4 cells was hypermethylated and inactive. Hypermethylation of gene p15 was attenuated and p15 gene was activated de novo after 5 days exposure to PHI in a concentration-dependent manner. DNMT1 and DNMT3B were inhibited by PHI (P < 0.05). Alteration of DNMT3A was not significant at those concentrations. Acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 were accumulated markedly after exposure to PHI. CONCLUSION: PHI could induce both DNA demethylation and acetylated H3 and H4 accumulation in Molt-4 cells.

RESULTS: We demonstrated FLT3 protein expression (>20%) in 82% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 60% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 23% of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and 80% of biphenotypic leukemia. Further, FLT3 expression was seen to be significantly higher in AMLM2, M4, and M5 than in AMLM3. In B-ALL, FLT3 was found to be higher in pro-B-ALL and lower in early B-ALL. A CD34 expression >20% was associated with FLT3 positive B-ALL. When correlated with disease status, all patients in the relapsed AML group had FLT3 > 20% at diagnosis. Unlike AML, the relapsed group of B-ALL showed a lower incidence of FLT3 than the remission group.

Some tumour suppressor microRNAs appear to be an integral part of the p53 and Retinoblastoma (RB) network, the main regulatory pathways controlling senescence, a major tumour suppressor mechanism. The INK4a/ARF locus which codifies for two proteins, p19ARF and p16INK4a, plays a central role in senescence by controlling both p53 and RB. Recent evidence shows that the proto-oncogene leukaemia/lymphoma related factor, a p19ARF specific repressor, is controlled by miRNAs and that miRNAs, in particular miR-20a and miR-290, are causatively involved in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) senescence in culture. Intriguingly, both miR-20a, member of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster, and miR-290, belonging to the miR-290-295 cluster, are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The pro-senescence role of miR-20a and miR-290 in MEF is apparently in contrast with their proliferative role in tumour and ES cells. We propose that miRNAs may exert opposing functions depending on the miRNAs repertoire as well as target/s level/s present in different cellular contexts, suggesting the importance of evaluating miRNAs activity in diverse genetic settings before their therapeutic use as tumour suppressors.","['(c) 2010 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2010 Foundation for Cellular and', 'Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']","['Rizzo, Milena', 'Mariani, Laura', 'Pitto, Letizia', 'Rainaldi, Giuseppe', 'Simili, Marcella']","['Rizzo M', 'Mariani L', 'Pitto L', 'Rainaldi G', 'Simili M']","['Laboratory of Gene and Molecular Therapy, Institute of Clinical Physiology, CNR, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN20a microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN290 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",PMC4373484,2010/12/01 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2010/12/01 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01173.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2010 Nov;14(11):2633-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01173.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APR-246 alone and in combination with other drugs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: Primary leukemic cells from patients with AML and AML cell lines were studied with respect to cytotoxic and apoptotic effects and mechanism of action of APR-246, alone and in combination with Ara-C, daunorubicin and fludarabine. RESULTS: APR-246 showed dose-dependent cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in AML cell lines as well as in primary AML patient cells. Cells from patients with TP53 mutation and complex karyotype were more resistant to conventional drugs while these factors did not significantly affect the sensitivity to APR-246. APR-246 increased active caspase-3, upregulated p53 protein levels, and increased the bax/bcl-2 ratio independently of TP53 mutational status in patient cells sensitive to APR-246. AML cells with high p14(ARF) expression were significantly more sensitive to APR-246. APR-246 induced significant synergistic effects in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Pre-incubation with APR-246 induced more synergistic effects compared to other schedules. In patient cells, pronounced synergism was found when combining APR-246 with danuorubicin. CONCLUSION: We conclude that APR-246 is effective in AML cells irrespectively of TP53 mutational status and that it has promising properties for combination studies in AML.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Ali, Dina', 'Jonsson-Videsater, Kerstin', 'Deneberg, Stefan', 'Bengtzen, Sofia', 'Nahi, Hareth', 'Paul, Christer', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Ali D', 'Jonsson-Videsater K', 'Deneberg S', 'Bengtzen S', 'Nahi H', 'Paul C', 'Lehmann S']","['Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110111,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aza Compounds)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'GHC34M30BG (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo(2,2,2,)octan-3-one)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Aza Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,2010/12/01 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2010/12/01 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01557.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Mar;86(3):206-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01557.x.

This mutation causes constitutive activation of FLT3 and is associated with poor prognosis. The high relapse rate of FLT3/ITD-positive AML might be partly because of insufficient eradication of slow-cycling leukaemic stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. beta1 integrin mediates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homing along with their retention in the bone marrow and also inhibits haematopoietic proliferation and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of FLT3/ITD kinase activity by a FLT3 selective inhibitor named FI-700 decreases affinity of alpha4beta1 integrin to soluble VCAM-1. alpha4beta1 integrin deactivation by FI-700 is independent of Rap1, which is the critical regulator of integrin inside-out signalling. In addition, selective inhibition of FLT3/ITD induces Pyk2 dephosphorylation together with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Both wild-type and ITD-FLT3 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with beta1 integrin and Pyk2 indicating the signal crosstalk between FLT3, beta1 integrin and Pyk2. These results collectively indicated that the inhibition of FLT3 kinase might contribute not only to the induction of apoptosis, but also to the leukaemia cell detachment from the bone marrow microenvironment in the treatment of AML.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],"['Katsumi, Akira', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Tanizaki, Ryohei', 'Iwasaki, Toshihiro', 'Kobayashi, Miki', 'Matsushita, Tadashi', 'Kaibuchi, Kozo', 'Senga, Takeshi', 'Kojima, Tetsuhito', 'Kohno, Takayuki', 'Hamaguchi, Michinari', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Katsumi A', 'Kiyoi H', 'Abe A', 'Tanizaki R', 'Iwasaki T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Matsushita T', 'Kaibuchi K', 'Senga T', 'Kojima T', 'Kohno T', 'Hamaguchi M', 'Naoe T']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, 35 Gengo, Morioka-cho, Obu 474-8511, Japan. katsumi@ncgg.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110125,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (FI-700)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TERF2IP protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 2/*physiology', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*physiology']",,2010/12/01 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2010/12/01 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01556.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Mar;86(3):191-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01556.x.
