Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in particular, has been implicated in pathological damage and is released pretransplant due to irradiation and cytotoxic preconditioning regimens. Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a natural immunosuppressant of TNF, may be involved in downregulation of these responses, which may be an individual patient-specific effect. In this study, we determined the genotype for polymorphisms associated with TNF and IL-10 in 80 potential allo-BMT recipients and correlated the genotype with the severity of GVHD in 49 patients for whom clinical data relating to GVHD was available. The widely studied TNF -308 polymorphism does not show any significant associations, but the d3 homozygous allele of the TNFd microsatellite is preferentially associated with grade III/IV GVHD (7 of 11 patients) compared with its occurrence in 8 of 38 patients with grade 0/II GVHD (P =.006). Alleles of the IL-10 (-)1064 promoter region microsatellite polymorphism that possess greater numbers of dinucleotide (CA) repeats also significantly associate with more severe GVHD. This region has been demonstrated to be important in the regulation of the IL-10 promoter. Eighteen of 38 patients with grade 0-II GVHD possessed alleles with greater numbers (12 or more) of dinucleotide repeats, compared with 9 of 11 cases with grade III-IV GVHD (P <.02). Of the 38 patients with grade 0-II GVHD, 3 of 38 had a both TNFd3/d3 and IL-10 (12-15) genotype, compared with 6 of 11 patients with grade III-IV GVHD (P <.001). There was no association of either the TNFd or IL-10 microsatellite polymorphisms with mortality (P =.43 and.51, respectively). Our results suggest that patient cytokine gene polymorphism genotypes may influence GVHD outcome by affecting cytokine activation during the pretransplant conditioning regimens, and these results are the first to suggest a genetic predisposition to this important transplant-related complication.","['Middleton, P G', 'Taylor, P R', 'Jackson, G', 'Proctor, S J', 'Dickinson, A M']","['Middleton PG', 'Taylor PR', 'Jackson G', 'Proctor SJ', 'Dickinson AM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund (LRF) Laboratory, Catherine Cookson Building, The Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Dinucleotide Repeats', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*genetics', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Nuclear Family', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Recurrence', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57839-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3943-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major subtypes discerned are follicle center cell lymphomas, immunocytomas (marginal zone B-cell lymphomas), and large B-cell lymphomas of the leg. In this study, we analyzed the variable heavy chain (VH) genes of 7 of these lymphomas, ie, 4 follicle center cell lymphomas (diffuse large-cell lymphomas) and 3 immunocytomas. We show that all these lymphomas carry heavily mutated VH genes, with no obvious bias in VH gene usage. The low ratios of replacement versus silent mutations observed in the framework regions of 5 of the 7 lymphomas suggest that the structure of the B-cell antigen receptor was preserved, as in normal B cells that are selected for antibody expression. Moreover, evidence for ongoing mutation was obtained in 3 immunocytomas and in one lymphoma of large-cell type. In addition, in 1 immunocytoma, both IgG- and IgA-expressing clones were found, indicative of isotype switching.

However, the mechanism of transformation is complex and not well understood. A method to rapidly and reversibly activate c-ABL was created by fusing the extra-cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor with c-ABL (EPO R/ABL). When this chimeric receptor was expressed in Ba/F3 cells, the addition of EPO resulted in a dose-dependent activation of c-ABL tyrosine kinase and was strongly antiapoptotic and weakly mitogenic. To evaluate the contributions of various ABL domains to biochemical signaling and biological effects, chimeric receptors were constructed in which the ABL SH3 domain was deleted (triangle upSH3), the SH2 domain was deleted (triangle upSH2), the C-terminal actin-binding domain was deleted (triangle upABD), or kinase activity was eliminated by a point mutation, K290M (KD). The mutant receptors were stably expressed in Ba/F3 cells and analyzed for signaling defects, proliferation, viability, and EPO-induced leukemia in nude mice. When compared with the ability of the full-length EPO R/ABL receptor to induce proliferation and support viability in vitro, the triangle upSH3 mutant was equivalent, the triangle upSH2 mutant was moderately impaired, and the triangle upABD and KD mutants were profoundly impaired. None of these cell lines caused leukemia in mice in the absence of pharmacological doses of EPO. However, in mice treated with EPO (10 U/d), death from leukemia occurred rapidly with wild-type and triangle upSH3. However, time to death was prolonged by at least twofold for triangle upSH2 and greater than threefold for triangle upABD. This inducible model of ABL transformation provides a method to link specific signaling defects with specific biological defects and has shown an important role for the C-terminal actin-binding domain in proliferation and transformation in the context of this receptor/oncogene.","['Okuda, K', ""D'Andrea, A"", 'Van Etten, R A', 'Griffin, J D']","['Okuda K', ""D'Andrea A"", 'Van Etten RA', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies or Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Center for Blood Research, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', '*Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'src Homology Domains']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57829-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3848-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, we and others demonstrated that AF4 transcripts are present in a variety of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic human cells. To further study the wild-type and leukemia fusion AF4, we used glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins as immunogens to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies that were specific for normal and chimeric AF4 proteins. Using Western blotting analysis, we demonstrated that the AF4 gene encodes proteins with apparent molecular weight of 125 and 145 kD. A 45-kD protein coprecipitated with AF4 protein in immunoprecipitation. Also, the anticipated MLL-AF4-encoded 240-kD protein was detected in all cell lines with t(4;11) translocations; fusion proteins were present in lesser quantity than the wild-type AF4. The proteins recognized by the antibodies are of the predicted sizes of the AF4 and MLL-AF4-encoded proteins based on previous DNA sequencing analysis. The MLL-AF4 fusion protein had a similar subcellular distribution as AF4. Both t(4;11) and non-t(4;11) leukemic cells showed a similar pattern of punctate nuclear staining in all cell lines tested using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. AF4 antibodies should be useful for further elucidation of the function of AF4 in normal cellular physiology, as well as the function of MLL-AF4 in leukemogenesis.

Effective laboratory animal models of CML are needed to study the molecular mechanisms by which the bcr-abl oncogene acts in the disease progression of CML. We used a murine stem cell retroviral vector (MSCV) to transduce the bcr-abl/p210 oncogene into mouse bone marrow cells and found that expression of Bcr-Abl/p210 induced a myeloproliferative disorder that resembled the chronic phase of human CML in 100% of bone marrow transplanted mice in about 3 weeks. This CML-like disease was readily transplanted to secondary recipient mice. Multiple clones of infected cells were expanded in the primary recipients, but the leukemia was primarily monoclonal in the secondary recipient mice. Mutation analysis demonstrated that the protein tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl/p210 was essential for its leukemogenic potential in vivo. Interestingly, we found that the leukemic cells expressed excess interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the diseased mice. These studies demonstrate that expression of Bcr-Abl can induce a CML-like leukemia in mice much more efficiently and reproducibly than in previously reported mouse CML models, probably due to efficient expression in the correct target cell(s). Our first use of this model for analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in CML raises the possibility that excess expression of hematopoietic growth factors such as IL-3 and GM-CSF may contribute to the clinical phenotype of CML.","['Zhang, X', 'Ren, R']","['Zhang X', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, the Department of Biochemistry, and the Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/virology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Transfection']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57827-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3829-40.,,['CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a human BM stromal cell culture that supports the growth of normal human B-cell precursors, we established a pre-B ALL cell line designated BLIN-2. BLIN-2 has a clonal rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain locus, a dic(9;20) chromosomal abnormality, and a bi-allelic deletion of the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) genes. The most interesting feature of BLIN-2 is an absolute dependence on adherent human BM stromal cells for sustained survival and growth. BLIN-2 cultured in the absence of BM stromal cells undergo apoptosis, and direct contact with viable BM stromal cells is essential for optimal growth. BLIN-2 cells also grow on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-negative human skin fibroblasts, making it unlikely that a very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)/VCAM-1 interaction is required for BLIN-2 growth. Western blot analysis of BLIN-2 cells cultured in the presence or absence of BM stromal cells demonstrates that contact of BLIN-2 with BM stromal cells induces hyperphosphorylation of Rb. In contrast, the pre-B ALL cell line BLIN-1, which has a bi-allelic deletion of p16(INK4a) p19(ARF) but does not require BM stromal cells for growth, does not undergo Rb phosphorylation after BM stromal cell contact. The BLIN-2 cell line will facilitate identification of ligand/receptor interactions at the B-cell precursor/BM stromal cell interface and may provide new insight into microenvironmental regulation of leukemic cell survival and growth.","['Shah, N', 'Oseth, L', 'LeBien, T W']","['Shah N', 'Oseth L', 'LeBien TW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, Center for Immunology, and the Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57826-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3817-28.,,"['R01 CA31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA76055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro activity of flavopiridol against human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and potential mechanisms of action for inducing cytotoxicity were studied. The in vitro viability of mononuclear cells from CLL patients (n = 11) was reduced by 50% at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 4 days at a flavopiridol concentration of 1.15 micromol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] +/-0.31), 0.18 micromol/L (95% CI +/-0.04), and 0.16 micromol/L (95% CI +/-0.04), respectively. Loss of viability in human CLL cells correlated with early induction of apoptosis. Exposure of CLL cells to 0.18 micromol/L of flavopiridol resulted in both decreased expression of p53 protein and cleavage of the caspase-3 zymogen 32-kD protein with the appearance of its 20-kD subunit. Contrasting observations of others in tumor cell lines, flavopiridol cytotoxicity in CLL cells did not correlate with changes in bcl-2 protein expression alterations. We evaluated flavopiridol's dependence on intact p53 by exposing splenocytes from wild-type (p53(+/+)) and p53 null (p53(-/-)) mice that demonstrated no preferential cytotoxicity as compared with a marked differential with F-ara-a and radiation. Incubation of CLL cells with antiapoptotic cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) did not alter the LC50 of flavopiridol, as compared with a marked elevation noted with F-ara-a in the majority of patients tested.

MLL is involved in translocations that result in de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), mixed lineage leukemia, and also in therapy AML (t-AML) and therapy ALL (t-ALL) resulting from treatment with DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) targeting drugs. MLL can recombine with more than 30 other chromosomal bands, of which 16 of the partner genes have been cloned. Breaks in MLL occur in an 8. 3-kb breakpoint cluster region (BCR) encompassing exons 5 through 11. We recently demonstrated that 75% of de novo patient breakpoints in MLL mapped in the centromeric half of the BCR between two scaffold-associated regions (SAR), whereas 75% of the t-AML patient breakpoints mapped to the telomeric half of the BCR within a strong SAR. We have mapped additional structural elements in the BCR. An in vivo DNA topo II cleavage site (induced with several different drugs that target topo II) mapped near exon 9 in three leukemia cell lines. A strong DNase I hypersensitive site (HS) also mapped near exon 9 in four leukemia cell lines, including two in which MLL was rearranged [a t(6;11) and a t(9;11)], and in two lymphoblastoid cell lines with normal MLL. Two of the leukemia cell lines also showed an in vivo topo II cleavage site. Our results suggest that the chromatin structure of the MLL BCR may influence the location of DNA breaks in both de novo and therapy-related leukemias. We propose that topo II is enriched in the MLL telomeric SAR and that it cleaves the DNase I HS site after treatment with topo II inhibitors. These events may be involved in recombination associated with t-AML/t-ALL breakpoints mapping in the MLL SAR.","['Strissel, P L', 'Strick, R', 'Rowley, J D', 'Zeleznik-Le, N J']","['Strissel PL', 'Strick R', 'Rowley JD', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Substrate Specificity', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57824-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3793-803.,,"['CA 400046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09273-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous methods failed to yield this disease at a frequency sufficient enough to allow for its use in the study of CML pathogenesis. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an efficient and reproducible method for inducing a CML-like disease in mice receiving P210 bcr/abl-transduced bone marrow cells. All mice receiving P210 bcr/abl-transduced bone marrow cells succumb to a myeloproliferative disease between 3 and 5 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. The myeloproliferative disease recapitulates many of the hallmarks of human CML and is characterized by high white blood cell counts and extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs. Use of a retroviral vector coexpressing P210 bcr/abl and green fluorescent protein shows that the vast majority of bcr/abl-expressing cells are myeloid. Analysis of the proviral integration pattern shows that, in some mice, the myeloproliferative disease is clonal. In multiple mice, the CML-like disease has been transplantable, inducing a similar myeloproliferative syndrome within 1 month of transfer to sublethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. The disease in many of these mice has progressed to the development of acute lymphoma/leukemia resembling blast crisis. These results demonstrate that murine CML recapitulates important features of human CML. As such, it should be an excellent model for addressing specific issues relating to the pathogenesis and treatment of this disease.","['Pear, W S', 'Miller, J P', 'Xu, L', 'Pui, J C', 'Soffer, B', 'Quackenbush, R C', 'Pendergast, A M', 'Bronson, R', 'Aster, J C', 'Scott, M L', 'Baltimore, D']","['Pear WS', 'Miller JP', 'Xu L', 'Pui JC', 'Soffer B', 'Quackenbush RC', 'Pendergast AM', 'Bronson R', 'Aster JC', 'Scott ML', 'Baltimore D']","['Department of Pathology and Institute for Medicine and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. wpear@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/virology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Virus Integration']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57823-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3780-92.,,"['CA16520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA51462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA61033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As B-CLL is mainly of B-1 cell type that participates in autoantibody production, genetically-determined regulatory abnormalities in proliferation and/or differentiation of B-1 cells may determine their fate. We earlier found that, in H-2-congenic (NZB x NZW) F1 mice, while H-2(d/z) heterozygosity predisposes to autoimmune disease, H-2(z/z) homozygosity predisposes to B-CLL. Studies also suggested the involvement of non-H-2-linked NZW allele(s) in leukemogenesis. Using H-2-congenic NZW and B10 mouse strains, their F1 and backcross progeny, we have now identified three major NZW susceptibility loci for abnormal proliferation of B-1 cells, which form the basis of leukemogenesis; one H-2-linked locus on chromosome 17 and the other two non-H-2-linked loci, each on chromosome 13 and chromosome 17. Each susceptibility allele functioned independently, in an incomplete dominant fashion, the sum of effects determining the extent of aberrant B-1 cell frequencies. The development of leukemia was associated with age-related increase in B-1 cell frequencies in the blood. Thus, these alleles probably predispose B-1 cells to accumulate genetic alterations, giving rise to B-CLL. Potentially important candidate genes and correlation of the findings with autoimmune disease are discussed.","['Hamano, Y', 'Hirose, S', 'Ida, A', 'Abe, M', 'Zhang, D', 'Kodera, S', 'Jiang, Y', 'Shirai, J', 'Miura, Y', 'Nishimura, H', 'Shirai, T']","['Hamano Y', 'Hirose S', 'Ida A', 'Abe M', 'Zhang D', 'Kodera S', 'Jiang Y', 'Shirai J', 'Miura Y', 'Nishimura H', 'Shirai T']","['Department of Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oncogenes']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57822-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3772-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of them were evaluated for occurrence of VOD according to previously defined clinical criteria. The clinical course, outcome, value of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions, and the influence of previously described risk factors were analyzed. During the study period, 1,652 BMT were performed in 73 centers. VOD was diagnosed in 87 patients (5.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2% to 6.4%). Fifty-six of 631 allogeneic BMT (8.9%) and 31 of 1,010 autologous BMT (3.1%) developed this complication (P <.0001). VOD was classified as mild in 7 (8%), moderate in 56 (64.4%), and severe in 24 (27.6%) cases. Sixteen patients died of VOD (corresponding to 1% of the whole series, 18.4% of VOD patients, and 66.7% of severe VOD). The use of unfractionated heparin did not significantly decrease the incidence of VOD. Independent variables associated with an increased risk of VOD were allogeneic BMT (relative risk [RR], 2.8; P <.001), pre-BMT elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (RR, 2.4; P =.001), high-dose cytoreductive therapy (RR, 2.3; P =.003), Karnofsky performance score less than 90% (RR, 2.7; P =.006), and prior abdominal radiation (RR, 2.9; P =.03). In conclusion, this prospective study shows that (1) the incidence of VOD is lower than that reported in smaller studies from single centers, (2) about one fourth of cases of VOD progress to severe disease, (3) main risk factors have a major impact on incidence of VOD, and (4) the use of prophylactic unfractionated heparin does not seem to reduce the incidence of VOD.","['Carreras, E', 'Bertz, H', 'Arcese, W', 'Vernant, J P', 'Tomas, J F', 'Hagglund, H', 'Bandini, G', 'Esperou, H', 'Russell, J', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Di Girolamo, G', 'Demuynck, H', 'Hartmann, O', 'Clausen, J', 'Ruutu, T', 'Leblond, V', 'Iriondo, A', 'Bosi, A', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Koza, V', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Apperley, J F']","['Carreras E', 'Bertz H', 'Arcese W', 'Vernant JP', 'Tomas JF', 'Hagglund H', 'Bandini G', 'Esperou H', 'Russell J', 'de la Rubia J', 'Di Girolamo G', 'Demuynck H', 'Hartmann O', 'Clausen J', 'Ruutu T', 'Leblond V', 'Iriondo A', 'Bosi A', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Koza V', 'Gratwohl A', 'Apperley JF']","['Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Universita degli Studi La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. bmtunit@medicina.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57803-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3599-604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to elucidate this problem by sequentially studying three patients with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia after sex-mismatched BMT from time before donor leukocyte infusion until achievement of complete molecular remission. Lineage-specific chimerism was assessed longitudinally by a combined fluorescent immunophenotyping and sex chromosome-specific in situ hybridization approach. Results were related to quantitative detection of bcr-abl transcripts by competitive differential reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), qualitative bcr-abl RT-PCR, and multiplex PCR-based DNA donor/recipient chimerism. All patients had predominant donor lymphopoiesis at the time of DLI, suggesting a state of tolerance to recipient leukemic and/or normal cells. In contrast, granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis were mainly recipient derived in both patients with hematologic relapse and partly recipient derived in the patient with molecular relapse. Eighty percent, 90%, and 8% of CD34(+) cells, respectively, were found to be of recipient origin at relapse, and few donor stem cells predicted for cytopenia post-DLI. Responses were seen after a time lag of 5 to 13 weeks after DLI and resulted in reversal to full donor chimerism within a critical switch period of 4 to 5 weeks. A sudden decrease in recipient cells was paralleled by a sharp decrease in bcr-abl transcript numbers detectable several weeks before achievement of molecular remission and onset of clinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This response pattern was confirmed by retrospective RT-PCR analysis in an additional five patients. Prospective monitoring of stem cell chimerism and response may enable us to individually tailor adoptive immunotherapy in the future.","['Baurmann, H', 'Nagel, S', 'Binder, T', 'Neubauer, A', 'Siegert, W', 'Huhn, D']","['Baurmann H', 'Nagel S', 'Binder T', 'Neubauer A', 'Siegert W', 'Huhn D']","['Abteilung fur Innere Medizin mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie/Onkologie, Virchow Klinikum der Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

Among the AML patients, 13 were in first remission, 9 were in untreated first relapse or second remission, and 12 were in refractory relapse. Patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide in combination with either total body irradiation (TBI; N = 29) or busulfan (N = 11). Source of stem cells included 6 autologous donors, 15 HLA genotypically identical siblings, 14 haploidentical family members, and 5 unrelated donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was methotrexate (MTX) for 17, MTX plus cyclosporine (CSP) for 14, or CSP plus prednisone for 3. Incidence of severe (grade 3-4) regimen-related toxicity was 10% and transplant-related mortality was 10%. Acute GVHD (grades II-III) occurred in 39% of allogeneic patients, and chronic GVHD developed in 40%. Relapse, the most significant problem for patients in this study, occurred in 1 MDS patient and 23 AML patients and was the cause of death for 19 patients. The 2-year probabilities of relapse are 46%, 67%, and 92%, respectively, for patients transplanted in first remission, untreated first relapse or second remission, and relapse. One MDS and 8 AML patients received second marrow transplants for treatment of relapse, and 5 of these survive disease-free for more than 1.5 years. All 6 MDS patients and 11 of 34 AML patients survive more than 1.5 years later. The 5-year probabilities of survival and disease-free survival are 54% and 38% for patients transplanted in first remission and 33% and 22% for untreated first relapse or second remission. None of the patients transplanted with refractory relapse survive disease-free. Outcome was significantly associated with phase of disease at transplantation and pretransplant diagnosis of extramedullary disease. Long-term sequelae included growth failure and hormonal deficiencies. Survival performance was a median of 100% (80% to 100%) and neurologic development for all survivors was appropriate for age. This study indicates that infants with AML have similar outcome after BMT compared with older children and that BMT should be performed in first remission whenever possible. In addition, allogeneic BMT provides effective therapy for the majority of infants with MDS.","['Woolfrey, A E', 'Gooley, T A', 'Sievers, E L', 'Milner, L A', 'Andrews, R G', 'Walters, M', 'Hoffmeister, P', 'Hansen, J A', 'Anasetti, C', 'Bryant, E', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Sanders, J E']","['Woolfrey AE', 'Gooley TA', 'Sievers EL', 'Milner LA', 'Andrews RG', 'Walters M', 'Hoffmeister P', 'Hansen JA', 'Anasetti C', 'Bryant E', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Sanders JE']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. awoolfre@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57796-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3546-56.,,"['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK02431/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfection of the Nalm-6 and Reh B-precursor ALL leukemia cell lines with an expression plasmid was investigated using lipofection, electroporation, and a polycationic compound. Only the liposomal compound Cellfectin showed significant gene transfer (3.9% to 12% for Nalm-6 cells and 3.1% to 5% for Reh cells). Transduction with gibbon-ape leukemia virus pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-based retrovirus vectors was investigated in various settings. Cocultivation of ALL cell lines with packaging cell lines showed the highest transduction efficiency for retroviral gene transfer (40.1% to 87.5% for Nalm-6 cells and 0.3% to 9% for Reh cells), followed by transduction with viral supernatant on the recombinant fibronectin fragment CH-296 (13% to 35.5% for Nalm-6 cells and 0.4% to 6% Reh cells), transduction on human bone marrow stroma monolayers (3.2% to 13.3% for Nalm-6 cells and 0% to 0.2% Reh cells), and in suspension with protamine sulfate (0.7% to 3.1% for Nalm-6 cells and 0% for Reh cells). Transduction of both Nalm-6 and Reh cells with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)-based lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope produced the best gene transfer efficiency, transducing greater than 90% of both cell lines. Gene delivery into primary human B-precursor ALL cells from patients was then investigated using MoMuLV-based retrovirus vectors and HIV-1-based lentivirus vectors. Both vectors transduced the primary B-precursor ALL cells with high efficiencies.

To characterize the early effects of the transgene product on lymphopoiesis, we initially sequenced the Ig heavy chain (IgH) rearrangements within the late pro-B cells in 24-day-old E-mu-ret and transgene negative mice. In both mouse populations, the IgH rearrangements were polyclonal, predominately nonproductive, and exhibited similar V, D, and J gene usage. However, the frequency of N regions, a marker of postnatal lymphopoiesis, was notably different. At the VD junction, N regions were found in 25 of 25 (100. 0%) rearrangements from transgene-negative mice compared with 12 of 36 (33.3%) rearrangements from Emicro-ret mice. At the DJ junction, N regions were found in 21 of 25 (84.0%) rearrangements from transgene negative mice compared with 4 of 36 (11.1%) rearrangements from E-mu-ret mice. Subsequently, we sequenced the clonal IgH rearrangements from 9 leukemias that developed in 10-to 38-week-old mice and found that 7 leukemias had a least 1 rearrangement that lacked N regions at the DJ junction. In addition, V replacement events were observed in the 1 leukemia studied in detail. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for N region addition, was expressed at markedly lower levels in late pro-B cells from 7- to 10-day-old E-mu-ret mice compared with transgene-negative mice. Examination of fetal lymphopoiesis in E-mu-ret mice identified a relative increase in early (CD45R+CD43(+)CD24(+)BP-1(-)) and late pro-B cells and a decrease in more differentiated CD43(-) B-lineage cells. Fetal early pro-B cells from Emicro-ret mice proliferated threefold to fivefold greater but differentiated to a lesser extent than those from transgene negative mice when cultured in vitro with interleukin-7. These data suggest that the B precursor leukemias in adult E-mu-ret mice arise from the progeny of pro-B cells generated in utero.","['Zeng, X X', 'Zhang, H', 'Hardy, R R', 'Wasserman, R']","['Zeng XX', 'Zhang H', 'Hardy RR', 'Wasserman R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Department of Pediatrics, The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/embryology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*embryology/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57794-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3529-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracellularly transported adenosine seemed to be required for the induction of apoptosis, since dipyridamole, which inhibits the transport of adenosine, strongly suppressed apoptosis, and 8-phenyltheophylline, a receptor antagonist, did not affect the adenosine-induced effect. The viability of adenosine-treated HL-60 cells was partially recovered by supplementation with a pyrimidine nucleoside, uridine or thymidine. Cytidine or deoxycytidine had no effect on the growth and survival of adenosine-treated cells, while uridine or thymidine inhibited adenosine-induced intracellular DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that the quantitative adjustment of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides might play an important role in the adenosine-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. The reduction of c-Myc expression in adenosine-treated cells was prevented by uridine or thymidine. These observations suggest that the expression of c-Myc might be related to an intracellular sensing system for the quantitative balance of nucleosides or nucleotides.","['Kim, K T', 'Yeo, E J', 'Choi, H', 'Park, S C']","['Kim KT', 'Yeo EJ', 'Choi H', 'Park SC']","['Department of Food and Nutrition, College of Human Ecology, Seoul National University, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'E6M543P3BL (8-phenyltheophylline)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Theophylline/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004320050201 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1998;124(9):471-7. doi: 10.1007/s004320050201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the effect of the novel ascomycin macrolactam derivative SDZ ASM 981 on Fc epsilonRI-mediated activation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, as a model for mast cell activation, was investigated. First, the ability to inhibit different mast cell immunophilins in vitro was tested. Using recombinant macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12), inhibition of rotamase activity with an IC50 of approximately 6 nM was observed. The rotamase activity of cyclophilin A (18 kDa) was not affected. Secondly, the effect of SDZ ASM 981 on Fc epsilonRI-mediated mast cell activation was investigated in the RBL cell model. SDZ ASM 981 inhibited exocytosis of preformed mediators (e.g. serotonin) with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM. Transcription and release of newly synthesized mediators (e.g. TNF-alpha) was inhibited with an IC50 of approximately 100 nM. The inhibitory effect of SDZ ASM 981 was antagonized by rapamycin. We conclude that SDZ ASM 981 is a potent inhibitor of Fc epsilonRI-mediated activation of mast cells in vitro. The mechanism of action involves formation of (calcineurin) inhibitory complexes with macrophilins. We suggest that this inhibitory action on mast cells might contribute to the antiinflammatory effect of SDZ ASM 981 observed in vivo (e.g. in aptopic dermatitis and psoriasis).","['Hultsch, T', 'Muller, K D', 'Meingassner, J G', 'Grassberger, M', 'Schopf, R E', 'Knop, J']","['Hultsch T', 'Muller KD', 'Meingassner JG', 'Grassberger M', 'Schopf RE', 'Knop J']","['University Hautklinik Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'AUF4U5NSJK (immunomycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'EC 5.1.1.- (Amino Acid Isomerases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Immunophilins)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Isomerases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/chemistry/metabolism', 'Immunophilins/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/drug effects', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Tacrolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/drug effects/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/drug effects']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004030050343 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 1998 Sep;290(9):501-7. doi: 10.1007/s004030050343.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major diagnostic categories were idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), organic GH deficiency (OGHD), and idiopathic short stature (ISS). Children with IGHD and ISS were underweight for height at baseline but had a progressive increase in WTHTZ during three years of rhGH therapy. The same pattern applied to children with IGHD associated with septo-optic dysplasia and CNS trauma or infection. However, children with OGHD associated with craniopharyngiomas, other CNS tumors, leukemia, or CNS irradiation were overweight when starting rhGH and showed a decrease in WTHTZ during the first year of rhGH therapy. The increase in WTHTZ during rhGH treatment in children with ISS and OGHD suggests that the GH-induced increase in muscle mass exceeded loss of fat mass. Because children with neoplasm-related OGHD were overweight at baseline, the decline in WTHTZ during the first year of rhGH therapy suggests that loss of fat mass is the predominant effect in this subgroup.","['Kaplowitz, P B', 'Rundle, A C', 'Blethen, S L']","['Kaplowitz PB', 'Rundle AC', 'Blethen SL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298-0140, USA.

Signal transduction is mediated through the receptor complex, consisting of two active seronine or threonine kinases (TGF-beta-receptor I and II) and the receptor-associated proteins betaglycan (TGF-beta-receptor III) and endoglin. In this study, we assessed the analysis of the role of TGF-beta and the transcription of the genes for TGF-beta and its receptor in highly purified leukemic B-cell precursors (BCPs) of patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL). Leukemic BCPs were positive for gene transcription of TGF-beta (9/9), the TGF-beta-receptor I (9/9), the TGF-beta-receptor II (6/6), betaglycan (5/6), and endoglin (6/6). Incubation with TGF-beta significantly reduced the cell viability of leukemic BCPs by a mean of 45% (p = 0.0009). The reduction of cell viability was associated with the induction of apoptosis by a mean of 31%. TGF-beta caused significant suppression of the S phase (p = 0.002) and accumulation in the G0/G1 phase (p = 0.0005). It also reduced expression of the adhesion surface receptor CD18 and the Fas antigen CD95 from 58% to 40% and from 48% to 27%, respectively. The data indicate that TGF-beta is a negative growth signal in leukemic BCPs and point to an additional role of TGF-beta as an immunomodulatory cytokine, suggesting a complex role of TGF-beta in the leukemogenesis of cALL.","['Buske, C', 'Becker, D', 'Feuring-Buske, M', 'Hannig, H', 'Griesinger, F', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B']","['Buske C', 'Becker D', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Hannig H', 'Griesinger F', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Blocking', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/immunology/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Nov;26(12):1155-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GATA-1 and EPOR mRNAs were detectable in all cases of erythroleukemia (French-American-British classification: M6) or early erythroblastic leukemia. In all other leukemia cases, including M2 through M5, stem cell leukemia, and adult T-cell leukemia, these gene transcripts were undetectable. GATA-2 was detectable in all the cases of primary leukemias examined in this study, except one case of M5. In one case, the phenotype switched from myeloid (M2) to erythroid (M6) and then back to myeloid. Northern blotting and RT-PCR revealed that GATA-1 and EPOR mRNAs were significantly upregulated at the M6 stage compared with the M2 stage. GATA-1 may be involved in the expression of an erythroid phenotype in acute leukemia. We generated HL-60 transfectants exogenously expressing GATA-1. The majority of HL-60 cells expressing GATA-1 lacked azurophilic granules, and electron microscopic analysis revealed that myeloperoxidase activity was negative. Platelet peroxidase activity, which was detectable in both megakaryoblasts and erythroid progenitors, was positive. However, EPOR and glycophorin A mRNAs were undetectable by RT-PCR. These findings suggest that besides GATA-1, a third factor may be required for the expression of mature erythroid phenotypes. In addition, our results indicate that GATA-1 is involved in inactivation of myeloperoxidase and activation of the platelet peroxidase.","['Komatsu, N', 'Kirito, K', 'Izumi, T', 'Eguchi, M', 'Miura, Y']","['Komatsu N', 'Kirito K', 'Izumi T', 'Eguchi M', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Size', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Nov;26(12):1148-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then analyzed 20 patients who responded with complete remission (CR) and 20 patients who had blast persistence (BP). The purpose of the study was to determine whether leukemic blasts from patients with BP were more resistant to chemotherapy than those from patients with CR. There was no significant correlation between the expression of any of these proteins alone and treatment outcome in both groups studied. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between the coexpression of at least two of these proteins and response (p = 0.0298), which turned out to be a significant independent prognostic factor for treatment failure (p = 0.0329, relative risk = 1.5) according to multivariate analysis.

Population-based data on the incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders were obtained from a specialist registry with a high level of ascertainment. Cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and plasma cell myeloma were excluded and the remaining cases classified as Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL were subdivided by site of origin and immunophenotype. Nodal B-cell lymphomas were further classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicle centre lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and miscellaneous. During the study period there was a significant increase in total lymphoproliferative disorders with an average change of 2.5% per annum equivalent to 0.84/10,0000. Most of this increase was due to an increasing incidence of extranodal B-cell lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. A numerically small but significant increase in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas was seen. There was no significant increase in other subtypes.

There are several reasons why changes in extranodal B-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma may have been particularly affected by changing diagnostic practices.

In order to extend our previously published work on conformationally restricted nitrogen mustards containing one piperidine ring, new bispiperidine derivatives were designed with varying lengths of carbon chain between the two rings and structure-activity relationships in these systems were studied. Thus samples of new bispiperidine salts 22-26 with chloromethyl groups at the 2-positions and a bridge between the two nitrogen atoms of 2-6 carbon atoms were synthesized. The analogous new bis(p-nitrophenylcarbamates) 17-21 were also prepared. The free bases were designed to be bifunctional alkylating agents via aziridinium ion formation with different distances between the two alkylating sites. The bispiperidines 22-24 were shown to alkylate guanines at the 7-position in the major groove of DNA more selectively than melphalan. The bispiperidine 22 with the shortest two carbon bridge was the most reactive but it was less cytotoxic than melphalan in a human colon carcinoma cell line (IC50 value approximately 30 microM) and in a human chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line (IC50 value approximately 12 microM). The most cytotoxic compound in the latter cell line was the carbamate 17, with an IC50 value of approximately 0.3 microM, and carbamates 17, 19 and 20 were most potent in a panel of human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. These compounds also showed circumvention of acquired cisplatin resistance in three paired cell lines.

Recent studies have shown that PKR may also play a role in the regulation of normal cellular growth. Although numerous examples of viral strategies for inactivation of PKR exist, there is no evidence of PKR inactivation in tumors. We demonstrate here that the Tik gene, which encodes a dual-specificity kinase, is the murine homolog of PKR, the dsRNA-dependent kinase, and has undergone a rearrangement of one allele in a murine lymphocytic leukemia cell. We have cloned a cDNA that corresponds to a mutated transcript from the rearranged mPKR gene and show that while the mutated polypeptide retains its ability to dimerize and bind dsRNA, it is catalytically inactive.

However, the findings that embryos lacking LIF-R or gp130 can develop beyond gastrulation argue for the existence of an alternative pathway(s) governing the maintenance of pluripotency in vivo. In order to define those factors that contribute to self-renewal in ES cell cultures, we have generated ES cells in which both copies of the lif gene are deleted. These cells showed a significantly reduced capacity for regeneration of stem cell colonies when induced to differentiate, confirming that LIF is the major endogenous regulatory cytokine in ES cell cultures. However, self-renewal was not abolished and undifferentiated ES cell colonies were still obtained in the complete absence of LIF. A differentiated, LIF-deficient, parietal endoderm-like cell line was derived and shown to support ES cell propagation via production of a soluble, macromolecular, trypsin-sensitive activity. This activity, which we name ES cell renewal factor (ESRF), is distinct from members of the IL-6/LIF family because (i) it is effective on ES cells lacking LIF-R; (ii) it is not blocked by anti-gp130 neutralizing antibodies; and (iii) it acts without activation of STAT3. ES cells propagated clonally using ESRF alone can contribute fully to chimaeras and engender germline transmission. These findings establish that ES cell pluripotency can be sustained via a LIF-R/gp130-independent, STAT-3 independent, signaling pathway. Operation of this pathway in vivo could play an important role in the regulation of pluripotency in the epiblast and account for the viability of lifr -/- and gp130 -/- embryos.","['Dani, C', 'Chambers, I', 'Johnstone, S', 'Robertson, M', 'Ebrahimi, B', 'Saito, M', 'Taga, T', 'Li, M', 'Burdon, T', 'Nichols, J', 'Smith, A']","['Dani C', 'Chambers I', 'Johnstone S', 'Robertson M', 'Ebrahimi B', 'Saito M', 'Taga T', 'Li M', 'Burdon T', 'Nichols J', 'Smith A']","[""Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JQ, Scotland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'M8502TLK98 (3-methoxybenzamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Growth Inhibitors/deficiency/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/deficiency/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Restriction Mapping', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(98)99026-1 [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1998.9026 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1998 Nov 1;203(1):149-62. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1998.9026.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Thirty patients had a t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation and were referred to as Ph+; 1292 were Ph negative(-). Outcome analyses used standard life table methods. RESULTS: Compared with Ph- ALL patients, Ph+ ALL patients were more likely to be black (P=0.008), age >10 years (P=0.02), and have a leukocyte count > or =50,000/L (P <0.0001). Nearly all Ph+ (96.7%) and Ph (98.3%) patients achieved remission after induction therapy, yet event free survival outcome was significantly worse for Ph+ patients compared with Ph- patients, with 4-year estimates of 20.1% (standard deviation [SD] = 9.1%) and 75.8% (SD =1.2%), respectively (P <0.0001). This difference was maintained among patients regardless of presenting leukocyte count, age, or early response to therapy. Ten Ph+ patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the time of first remission; six of these patients remained event free at the time of analysis, and represent the majority (six of eight) of patients surviving event free. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study confirm that Ph chromosome positivity represents a significant independent adverse risk factor for childhood ALL that has not been abrogated by current intensive chemotherapy programs. BMT at the time of first remission, as well as other alternative strategies employing biotherapeutic agents, should be considered in future front-line trials for pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL.","['Uckun, F M', 'Nachman, J B', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Kraft, P', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Lange, B', 'Hutchinson, R', 'Reaman, G H', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Heerema, N A']","['Uckun FM', 'Nachman JB', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Kraft P', 'Steinherz PG', 'Lange B', 'Hutchinson R', 'Reaman GH', 'Gaynon PS', 'Heerema NA']","[""Children's Cancer Group ALL Biology Reference Laboratory and Hughes Institute, St. Paul, Minnesota 55113, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/07 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/07 03:03'],"['1998/11/07 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/07 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981101)83:9<2030::AID-CNCR21>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Nov 1;83(9):2030-9.,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand HRPC fully, make decisions about choices of treatment as well as about clinical research on treatments for HRPC patients, and design appropriate measures of PSA response, it seems that first it would be necessary to understand how these serial measures of PSA relate to survival. The purpose of this study was to determine how repeated measurements of PSA impact on the probability of imminent death for patients with HRPC. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight men with HRPC were enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study 9181, in which they were treated with either a low dose (160 mg/day) or a high dose (640 mg/day) of megestrol acetate (MA). Because preliminary data analysis indicated that these treatments had no effect on survival, the authors pooled the data to analyze the overall dynamics of PSA and survival during the follow-up period. The authors attempted to correlate initial and monthly PSA measurements, which were mandated by the study protocol, with the probability of death at any time during follow-up. For statistical analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model and the general linear model were used. In addition to the level of PSA, the authors used the relative velocity of PSA, which was defined as (dy/dt)/y, with ""y"" symbolizing serum PSA and ""t"" symbolizing time. RESULTS: Both log(PSA) and the average relative velocity of PSA (rva) were significantly correlated with survival time (P=0.0001 and P=0.0008, respectively), and the analysis performed with the Cox proportional hazards model yielded the following formula for a PSA hazard score: PSA hazard score =0.251*(log(PSA) - mean log(PSA)) + 24.5*(rva - mean rva) This hazard score tended to be higher for patients who were about to die. For example, there was a close correlation between the hazard score and the probability of death as the next observed event. Furthermore, the hazard score provided a dynamic measure of how PSA was affected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The average relative velocity of PSA has been identified by the authors as a new measure of the dynamics of PSA in HRPC. It can be determined from sequential values of PSA. This average, together with the log(PSA), are significantly related to the probability of imminent death.","['Vollmer, R T', 'Dawson, N A', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Vollmer RT', 'Dawson NA', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Laboratory Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'TJ2M0FR8ES (Megestrol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megestrol Acetate/*therapeutic use', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/*blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/07 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/07 03:03'],"['1998/11/07 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/07 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981101)83:9<1989::AID-CNCR15>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19981101)83:9<1989::aid-cncr15>3.0.co;2-v [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Nov 1;83(9):1989-94. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19981101)83:9<1989::aid-cncr15>3.0.co;2-v.,,"['CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Cancer. 2001 Mar 1;91(5):1063-5.

The authors sought to review their experience with this toxicity as well as the world literature on the subject.

Fifteen previously reported cases of renal failure and proteinuria associated with IFN-alpha therapy are also reviewed. RESULTS: Renal biopsies performed on the authors' two patients revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, the other reported patients with IFN-alpha-associated renal failure and massive proteinuria had an assortment of pathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: The specific renal pathology associated with proteinuria may be a consequence of the condition and not its cause; differences in renal pathology may be caused by other predisposing factors. Patients treated with IFN-alpha following high dose chemotherapy, with or without autologous transplantation, should be followed for the development of proteinuria and renal failure.","['Shah, M', 'Jenis, E H', 'Mookerjee, B K', 'Schriber, J R', 'Baer, M R', 'Herzig, G P', 'Wetzler, M']","['Shah M', 'Jenis EH', 'Mookerjee BK', 'Schriber JR', 'Baer MR', 'Herzig GP', 'Wetzler M']","['Division of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/*chemically induced/urine', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Proteinuria/*chemically induced']",1998/11/07 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/07 03:03'],"['1998/11/07 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/07 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981101)83:9<1938::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Nov 1;83(9):1938-46.,,,['Cancer. 1999 Jun 15;85(12):2669-70.

Much of what is known has come from studies of the atomic bomb survivors, and to a lesser extent from patients receiving radiotherapy. These studies demonstrate that exposure to moderate to high doses of radiation increases the risk of cancer in most organs. For all solid cancers combined, cancers of the thyroid, breast and lung, and leukemia, risk estimates are fairly precise, and associations have been found at relatively low doses (<0.2 Gy). Associations between radiation and cancers of the salivary glands, stomach, colon, bladder, ovary, central nervous system and skin have also been reported, but the relationships are not as well quantified. Associations between radiation and cancers of the liver and esophagus, and to a lesser extent multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, have been reported in a few studies, but results are inconsistent. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and cancers of the pancreas, prostate, testis and cervix have rarely been linked to radiation exposure. A linear no-threshold model adequately describes the dose-response relationship for solid cancers, although at extremely high doses the risk appears to flatten out. Because few populations have been followed until the end of life, the temporal patterns of risk are not completely known. An increased risk, however, does continue for several decades. In contrast, radiation-related leukemias begin to occur shortly (2-3 years) after exposure and, at least in the A-bomb survivors, a linear-quadratic dose response seems to fit the data better than a pure linear model. Radiation does not act entirely in isolation. It can interact with other carcinogens, e.g. tobacco or chemotherapeutic agents, and with host factors such as age at exposure, gender or reproductive history. Interactions with medical interventions or with certain heritable mutations have also been suggested. While the studies of high-dose exposures are essential for understanding the overall biological consequences of radiation exposure, the public is more concerned about the long-term health effects from protracted exposures at low doses. Unfortunately, the inherent limitations of epidemiology make it extremely difficult to directly quantify health risks from these exposures. While most epidemiological data are compatible with linear extrapolations from exposures at high doses or high dose rates, they cannot entirely exclude other possibilities. As the field of epidemiology advances, understanding more about the health effects of prolonged and low-dose exposures will be the next challenge.","['Ron, E']",['Ron E'],"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1998/11/07 00:00,1998/11/07 00:01,['1998/11/07 00:00'],"['1998/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1998 Nov;150(5 Suppl):S30-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, Pml-/- mice and cells are protected from the lethal effects of ionizing radiation and anti-Fas antibody. Pml is required for caspase 1 and caspase 3 activation upon exposure to these stimuli. The PML-RAR alpha fusion protein of APL renders haemopoietic progenitor cells resistant to Fas-, TNF- and IFN-induced apoptosis with a lack of caspase 3 activation, thus acting as a Pml dominant-negative product.

We show here that PML overexpression induces rapid cell death, independent of de novo transcription and cell cycling. PML death involves cytoplasmic features of apoptosis in the absence of caspase-3 activation, and caspase inhibitors such as zVAD accelerate PML death. zVAD also accelerates interferon (IFN)-induced death, suggesting that PML contributes to IFN-induced apoptosis. The death effector BAX and the cdk inhibitor p27KIP1 are novel NB-associated proteins recruited by PML to these nuclear domains, whereas the acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) PML/RAR alpha oncoprotein delocalizes them. Arsenic enhances targeting of PML, BAX and p27KIP1 to NBs and synergizes with PML and IFN to induce cell death. Thus, cell death susceptibility correlates with NB recruitment of NB proteins. These findings reveal a novel cell death pathway that neither requires nor induces caspase-3 activation, and suggest that NBs participate in the control of cell survival.","['Quignon, F', 'De Bels, F', 'Koken, M', 'Feunteun, J', 'Ameisen, J C', 'de The, H']","['Quignon F', 'De Bels F', 'Koken M', 'Feunteun J', 'Ameisen JC', 'de The H']","[""CNRS UPR 9051, Laboratoire associe au comite de Paris de la ligue contre le cancer, Institut d'Hematologie de l'Universite Paris VII, Hopital St Louis, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, rat)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Arsenic/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/11/07 03:03,2001/03/23 10:01,['1998/11/07 03:03'],"['1998/11/07 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/07 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1038/3068 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1998 Nov;20(3):259-65. doi: 10.1038/3068.,,,['Nat Genet. 1998 Nov;20(3):220-2.

These results may indicate that the DSB repair defect previously identified in LY-S cells is due to a lack of function of DNA-PK or its impaired activation in the irradiated cells.","['Kruszewski, M', 'Wojewodzka, M', 'Iwanenko, T', 'Szumiel, I', 'Okuyama, A']","['Kruszewski M', 'Wojewodzka M', 'Iwanenko T', 'Szumiel I', 'Okuyama A']","['Department of Radiobiology and Health Protection, Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Warsaw, Poland. marcinkr@orange.ichtj.waw.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (3-cyano-5-(4-pyridyl)-6-hydrazonomethyl-2-pyridone)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Pyridones)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hydrazones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridones/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/07 00:00,1998/11/07 00:01,['1998/11/07 00:00'],"['1998/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0921-8777(98)00040-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0921-8777(98)00040-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1998 Oct 21;409(1):31-6. doi: 10.1016/s0921-8777(98)00040-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline hepatozoonosis has been reported infrequently and little is known about the pathogenesis of this infection. In order to further clarify clinicopathological characteristics of hepatozoonosis in domestic cats, a retrospecitve study of hepatozoonosis in cats admitted during 1989-1995 to the Hebrew University School of Veterinary Medicine was conducted. The study population comprised all the cats whose medical records included a complete blood count with a microscopical examination of a blood smear during this 7-year period (n=1229). Hepatozoon gametocytes were identified in seven cats (0.57%) ranging from 1 to 6 years of age. Infected cats were mostly males (6/7) of mixed breed (5/7) with a variety of complaints and clinical signs. The clinicopathological findings included increased activities of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (5/6) and creatine kinase (CK) (5/6). The elevated enzymes detected in cats with hepatozoonosis are suggestive of muscular damage. Sixty-seven percent (4/6) of the cats with hepatozoonosis which were tested for a retroviral disease were found infected either in FIV or FELV. In addition, 2/7 cats were co-infected with Hemobartonella felis. In conclusion, parasitemia with Hepatozoon sp. is a rare finding in cats from Israel. The over-representation of cats with a retroviral disease among the cats with hepatozoonosis indicates a possible association between immunosupression and the development of Hepatozoon infection.","['Baneth, G', 'Aroch, I', 'Tal, N', 'Harrus, S']","['Baneth G', 'Aroch I', 'Tal N', 'Harrus S']","['School of Veterinary Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, Israel. baneth@agri.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Parasitol,Veterinary parasitology,7602745,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Cat Diseases/immunology/*parasitology', 'Cats', 'Coccidiosis/immunology/parasitology/*veterinary', 'Creatine Kinase/blood', 'Eosinophils/cytology', 'Erythrocyte Count/veterinary', 'Eucoccidiida/*immunology/physiology', 'Female', 'Hematocrit/veterinary', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/11/07 00:00,1998/11/07 00:01,['1998/11/07 00:00'],"['1998/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-4017(98)00160-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4017(98)00160-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Parasitol. 1998 Oct;79(2):123-33. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4017(98)00160-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its use, however, has been associated with increased risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which is characterized by chromosomal translocations suggesting involvement of recombination-associated motifs at the breakpoints. A PCR-based assay was developed to quantitate the frequency of two illegitimate V(D)J recombinase-mediated genomic rearrangements-a 20-kb deletion in the hprt gene and the bcl2/IgH translocation (t(14;18)) found in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We examined both lymphocyte and non-lymphocyte blood cell DNA of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for changes in the frequencies of these biomarkers during etoposide therapy to determine the level of illegitimate V(D)J recombination changes during therapy. A low level of t(14;18) was found in the lymphocytes before etoposide treatment, which was significantly reduced during etoposide therapy. In before-etoposide samples, no t(14;18) were found among 7.72x107 non-lymphocytes; during treatment none were found among 1.87x108 non-lymphocytes. Deletions were not found before etoposide treatment in either the lymphocytes (6.67x107) or non-lymphocytes (5.43x107) and were non-significantly elevated during etoposide therapy (1 in 1.4x108 lymphocytes and 1 in 1.39x108 non-lymphocytes). It is interesting to note the one patient with an hprt deletion mutation in non-lymphocytes; V(D)J recombination is not normally found in this cell type, but is the cell type from which AML derives. Several patients had clones of t(14;18)-bearing cells as determined by DNA sequence analysis. These results suggest that this etoposide-based chemotherapy was ineffective in producing genomic rearrangements mediated by illegitimate V(D)J recombination in these patients.","['Fuscoe, J C', 'Knapp, G W', 'Hanley, N M', 'Setzer, R W', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Pui, C H', 'Relling, M V']","['Fuscoe JC', 'Knapp GW', 'Hanley NM', 'Setzer RW', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","['Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, Mail Drop 68, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, USA. fuscoe.jim@epamail.epa.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1998/11/07 00:00,1998/11/07 00:01,['1998/11/07 00:00'],"['1998/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(98)00129-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00129-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1998 Nov 9;419(1-3):107-21. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00129-6.,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,

Here, we describe an instrument set up suitable to record ultraweak light emission from human erythroleukemia K562 cells during and immediately after delivery of electric pulses. Most of light was emitted in the first seconds after each pulse, following a complex decay which can be fitted by a double exponential equation characterized by two different time constants (T1 and T2), both in the order of seconds. T1 was approximately 10-fold shorter than T2 and both time constants were dependent on field strength of the electric pulse.

Involvement of these signaling systems in the cytotoxicity of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and modulation of ara-C lethality by protein kinase C PKC inhibition/down-regulation was examined in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Exposure to ara-C (10 microM) for 6 hr promoted extensive apoptotic DNA damage and cell death, as well as activation of PKC. This response was accompanied by downstream activation of the SAPK and MAPK cascades. PKC-dependent MAPK activity seemed to limit ara-C action in that the toxicity of ara-C was enhanced by pharmacological reductions of PKC, MAPK, or both. Thus, ara-C action was (1) partially attenuated by diradylglycerols, which stimulated PKC and MAPK, but (2) dramatically amplified by sphingoid bases, which inhibited PKC and MAPK. The cytotoxicity of ara-C also was substantially increased by pharmacological reductions of PKC, including down-regulation of PKC by chronic preexposure to the macrocyclic lactone bryostatin 1 or inhibition of PKC by acute coexposure to the dihydrosphingosine analog safingol. Significantly, both of these manipulations prevented activation of MAPK by ara-C. Moreover, acute disruption of the MAPK module by AMF, a selective inhibitor of MEK1, suppressed both basal and drug-stimulated MAPK activity and sharply increased the cytotoxicity of ara-C, suggesting the direct involvement of MAPK as a downstream antiapoptotic effector for PKC. None of these chemopotentiating agents enhanced ara-CTP formation. Ceramide-driven SAPK activity did not seem to mediate drug-induced apoptosis, given that (1) neutralization of endogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha with monoclonal antibodies or soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor substantially reduced ceramide generation and SAPK activation by ara-C, whereas the induction of apoptosis was unaffected; (2) pharmacological inhibition of sphingomyelinase by 3-O-methoxysphingomyelin reduced ceramide generation and SAPK activation without limiting the drug's cytotoxicity; and (3) potentiation of ara-C action by bryostatin 1 or safingol was not associated with further stimulation of SAPK. These observations collectively suggest a primary role for decreased MAPK, rather than increased SAPK, in the potentiation of ara-C cytotoxicity by interference with PKC-dependent signaling.","['Jarvis, W D', 'Fornari, F A Jr', 'Tombes, R M', 'Erukulla, R K', 'Bittman, R', 'Schwartz, G K', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Jarvis WD', 'Fornari FA Jr', 'Tombes RM', 'Erukulla RK', 'Bittman R', 'Schwartz GK', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Macrolides', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism']",1998/11/06 03:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/06 03:02'],"['1998/11/06 03:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 03:02 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.54.5.844 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1998 Nov;54(5):844-56. doi: 10.1124/mol.54.5.844.,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL16660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since a T-lymphocyte-rich, but not a monocyte-rich preparation from splenocytes enhanced embryo implantation, similar effects of thymocytes from non-pregnant mice on implantation were examined in this study. Thymocytes were prepared from immature 21 day old ICR female mice and the supernatant of a thymocyte suspension (Th-sup) was used as the control. Thymocytes or Th-sup were injected into the caudal vein of recipient mice on pseudopregnancy day 2, and blastocysts were transferred into the endometrial lumen. The implantation rates per recipient were significantly higher in the thymocyte-treated group. ICR mice were then oophorectomized on pseudopregnancy day 3. After 3-day progesterone supplementation, blastocysts were transferred with intravenous injection of thymocytes or Th-sup. Under progesterone supplementation, successful implantations were observed in the thymocyte-treated group, but not in the Th-sup-treated group. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that mRNA expression of leukaemia inhibitory factor in the uterus was induced by thymocyte administration, but not by Th-sup. Thymocytes were divided into two populations, CD4(+/-)CD8(-) group and CD4(-)CD8(+/-) group, by separation columns. On pseudopregnancy day 2, the separated thymocytes in each group or their supernatant were injected into the endometrial stroma of the recipient mice, and blastocysts were transferred into the endometrial lumen. The administration of CD4(+/-) CD8(-) lymphocytes significantly promoted implantation rates, but no effect was observed in the CD4(-) CD8(+/-) group. These findings showed that thymocytes, especially CD4-positive lymphocytes, facilitate embryo implantation, probably by regulating endometrial differentiation.","['Fujita, K', 'Nakayama, T', 'Takabatake, K', 'Higuchi, T', 'Fujita, J', 'Maeda, M', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Mori, T']","['Fujita K', 'Nakayama T', 'Takabatake K', 'Higuchi T', 'Fujita J', 'Maeda M', 'Fujiwara H', 'Mori T']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Endometrium/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Pregnancy', 'Pseudopregnancy/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Uterus/*immunology/metabolism']",1998/11/06 00:00,1998/11/06 00:01,['1998/11/06 00:00'],"['1998/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/13.10.2888 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1998 Oct;13(1O):2888-94. doi: 10.1093/humrep/13.10.2888.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir are the first drugs approved in this class and significantly reduce HIV RNA copy number with minimal adverse effects. They are all substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4, and are incompletely bioavailable. The drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is highly expressed in the intestinal mucosa, could be responsible for the low oral bioavailability of these and other drugs which are substrates for this transporter. To determine whether these protease inhibitors are modulators of P-gp, we studied them in cell lines which do and do not express P-gp. Saquinavir, ritonavir and nelfinavir significantly inhibited the efflux of [3H]paclitaxel and [3H]vinblastine in P-gp-positive cells, resulting in an increase in intracellular accumulation of these drugs. However, similar concentrations of indinavir did not affect the accumulation of these anticancer agents. In photoaffinity labeling studies, saquinavir and ritonavir displaced [3H]azidopine, a substrate for P-gp, in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that saquinavir, ritonavir, and nelfinavir are inhibitors and possibly substrates of P-gp. Because saquinavir has a low bioavailability, its interaction with P-gp may be involved in limiting its absorption.","['Washington, C B', 'Duran, G E', 'Man, M C', 'Sikic, B I', 'Blaschke, T F']","['Washington CB', 'Duran GE', 'Man MC', 'Sikic BI', 'Blaschke TF']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305-5130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '5W6YA9PKKH (Indinavir)', 'HO3OGH5D7I (Nelfinavir)', 'L3JE09KZ2F (Saquinavir)', 'O3J8G9O825 (Ritonavir)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/metabolism/toxicity', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Indinavir/metabolism/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Nelfinavir/metabolism/toxicity', 'Paclitaxel/metabolism/toxicity', 'Ritonavir/metabolism/toxicity', 'Saquinavir/metabolism/toxicity', 'Sarcoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Neoplasms', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/toxicity']",1998/11/06 00:00,1998/11/06 00:01,['1998/11/06 00:00'],"['1998/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199811010-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1998 Nov 1;19(3):203-9. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199811010-00001.,,"['GM07065/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1 CA 52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, bone marrow dysplasia with monosomy 7 was observed after 7 months of a combination therapy of immunosuppressant and G-CSF, which prompted the discontinuation of G-CSF administration. Thereafter, bone marrow hypoplasia gradually progressed, resulting in a second aplastic crisis.

Recent progress in the study of the hereditary and environmental factors of childhood leukemia is reviewed and discussed here.","['Mizutani, S']",['Mizutani S'],"[""Department of Virology, National Children's Medical Research Center, Tokyo, Japan. smizutani@nch.go.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Family Health', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",1998/11/06 00:00,1998/11/06 00:01,['1998/11/06 00:00'],"['1998/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S092557109800036X [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00036-x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1998 Aug;68(2):131-43. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00036-x.,,,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical response of patients with leukemias other than APL to differentiation inducers is limited, often with inconsistent outcome. Recently, numerous new differentiation inducers for various leukemia cells have been developed, some of which have had therapeutic effects on various leukemias in preclinical and clinical trials. Additionally, molecular control mechanisms of differentiation, and apoptosis of various leukemia cells by differentiation inducers have been studied extensively. These studies suggest that problems underlying the current discrepancy between preclinical and clinical therapeutic efficacy of leukemias can be overcome by these basic studies together with multidisciplinary studies on the therapy of leukemias in combination with differentiation therapy and other conventional therapies.","['Hozumi, M']",['Hozumi M'],"['Japan Immunoresearch Laboratories, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/therapy']",1998/11/06 00:00,1998/11/06 00:01,['1998/11/06 00:00'],"['1998/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571098000437 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00043-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1998 Aug;68(2):107-29. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00043-7.,,,,,176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is expressed in either a full-length form, alpha, or a shorter beta mRNA variant, with exon 13 spliced out. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of two new p73 splicing variants, gamma (splicing out exon 11) and delta (splicing out exons 11, 12, and 13). Both gamma and delta p73 variants are expressed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, primary keratinocytes, and different tumor cell lines, including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, hepatoma, and leukemia. The expression pattern of the four p73 splicing variants differs in both primary cells of different lineage and established cell lines even within the same type of tumor. A two-hybrid assay was used to characterize the homodimeric and heterodimeric interactions between the p73 variants, and showed that neither p73gamma nor p73delta interact with p53, whereas p73gamma showed strong interactions with all p73 isoforms, and p73delta binds efficiently p73alpha and p73gamma but only weakly p73beta. At the functional level, p73gamma is significantly less efficient in activating transcription of the p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter than p53 or p73beta, whereas the effect of p73delta is intermediate and comparable to that of p73alpha. The ability of the different p73 variants to affect cell growth in p53 null osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells correlates with their transcriptional activity on the p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter: p73beta is the most efficient in inhibiting colony formation, whereas p73gamma is almost ineffective. Our results suggest that p73 isoforms may be differentially regulated, with four different isoforms capable of interacting among themselves and with p53. The relative expression level of each splice variant may modulate p73 transcriptional and growth suppression activities by affecting heterodimer formation.","['De Laurenzi, V', 'Costanzo, A', 'Barcaroli, D', 'Terrinoni, A', 'Falco, M', 'Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli, M', 'Levrero, M', 'Melino, G']","['De Laurenzi V', 'Costanzo A', 'Barcaroli D', 'Terrinoni A', 'Falco M', 'Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M', 'Levrero M', 'Melino G']","['Biochemistry Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell\'Immacolata-IRCCS, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata, "" 00133 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/11/06 00:00,1998/11/06 00:01,['1998/11/06 00:00'],"['1998/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.188.9.1763 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1998 Nov 2;188(9):1763-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.188.9.1763.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2212516,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether adenosine is released from cultured rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells in response to antigen challenge and whether released adenosine enhances mediator release. RBL-2H3 cells closely resemble mucosal mast cells, the most common type of mast cell in lung tissue, and they express adenosine A3 receptors (which have been associated with asthma). Measurement of adenosine in RBL-2H3 cell incubation medium was possible if adenosine metabolism was inhibited by EHNA (10 microM; an adenosine deaminase inhibitor) and 5-iodotubericidin (5-IT; 10 microM; an adenosine kinase inhibitor). Basal adenosine concentration increased up to 1.0 microM during a 90 min incubation; after antigen challenge, adenosine concentration was increased by 0.3-0.4 microM above basal. Antigen-induced adenosine release ranged from 30-70 nmol/1.25x10(6) cells. Antigen-induced mediator release (beta-hexosaminidase and [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine) was increased by APNEA, an adenosine A3 receptor agonist (EC50 approximately 20 nm) but inhibited by EHNA and 5-IT, despite increased adenosine levels. This inhibition was not blocked by the adenosine A1/A2 receptor antagonist DPSPX (5 microM). Therefore, it is unlikely to be related to adenosine receptor activation. In conclusion, although our data provide no direct support for a positive feedback effect of adenosine on mast cell mediator release, the observation that IgE receptor stimulation increases adenosine production in cells which express stimulatory A3 receptors is consistent with this hypothesis.","['Lloyd, H G', 'Ross, L', 'Li, K M', 'Ludowyke, R I']","['Lloyd HG', 'Ross L', 'Li KM', 'Ludowyke RI']","['Department of Pharmacology, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia. hgelloyd@pharmacol.su.oz.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pulm Pharmacol Ther,Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics,9715279,"['0 (N(6)-2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyladenosine)', '0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '24386-93-4 (5-iodotubercidin)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '59262-86-1 (9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tubercidin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",1998/11/06 00:00,1998/11/06 00:01,['1998/11/06 00:00'],"['1998/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1094-5539(98)90113-4 [pii]', '10.1006/pupt.1998.0113 [doi]']",ppublish,Pulm Pharmacol Ther. 1998 Feb;11(1):41-6. doi: 10.1006/pupt.1998.0113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press'],,,,,,

Periodic endoscopic surveillance with multiple biopsies is adopted by most physicians to detect dysplasia or early carcinoma. We report a case of an 80-year-old white man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had periodic endoscopic surveillance without any evidence of dysplasia or cancer, and who died of metastatic carcinoma of the esophagus only 18 months after his last upper endoscopic examination. We suspect that the relative immunosuppressed state resulting from his CLL was the major contributor to the rapid progression of the Barrett's esophagus to cancer. Patients with CLL have higher risk of second cancers, and several cases of aggressive carcinomas have been reported in association with CLL. This is the first case report of metastatic esophageal cancer arising in Barrett's esophagus in a patient with CLL.

In the present study, we analyzed the role of synaptically driven spontaneous bioelectric (action potential) activity (SBA) and neurotrophic factors. Our model systems are organotypic monocultures of visual cortex which either grow as spontaneously active cultures or as activity-blocked cultures to which neurotrophic factors can be applied via the medium. NPY mRNA expressing neurons are detected by in situ hybridization and are quantified as a percentage of all neurons. In spontaneously active cultures, about 7% of all neurons express NPY mRNA. This expression is regulated by SBA, because expression is reduced to about 2% by different activity blockade paradigms. When putative NPY neurons differentiate under activity blockade, they are unable to restitute the NPY expression during a subsequent period of SBA. A restitution of the NPY phenotype in 6-7% of the neurons after a transient blockade of activity is only possible when neurons were initially allowed to differentiate in the presence of SBA. We then analyzed whether neurotrophic factors known to promote NPY expression can do so in the absence of SBA. Neurotrophin-4/5 and leukemia inhibitory factor, but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3, stimulate the NPY phenotype in the absence of SBA. In situ hybridization in combination with immuno-fluorescence reveals that NPY-ir neurons express the receptors trkB or LIFRbeta, but not trkC. This coexpression pattern explains why neurotrophin-4/5 and leukemia inhibitory factor are efficient regulators of the NPY-expression. Our results suggest that the NPY expression in neocortical neurons depends on epigenetic factors: spontaneous activity and neurotrophic factors modulate the expression and are thus involved in shaping the neurochemical architecture of the cerebral cortex.","['Wirth, M J', 'Gorba, T', 'Wahle, P']","['Wirth MJ', 'Gorba T', 'Wahle P']","['AG Entwicklungsneurobiologie, Fakultat fur Biologie, Ruhr-Universitat, Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Regul Pept,Regulatory peptides,8100479,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '145172-44-7 (neurotrophin 5)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",IM,"['Action Potentials', 'Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/genetics/pharmacology', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Visual Cortex/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",1998/11/05 00:00,1998/11/05 00:01,['1998/11/05 00:00'],"['1998/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-0115(98)00080-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-0115(98)00080-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Regul Pept. 1998 Sep 25;75-76:283-92. doi: 10.1016/s0167-0115(98)00080-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most myeloid leukemias express MPO enzyme activity at the light microscopic level, whereas lymphoid leukemias characteristically lack such expression. However, the diagnostic significance of MPO RNA expression or of immunohistochemically detectable MPO protein expression in leukemic blasts is unclear. We studied the prevalence and diagnostic significance of MPO RNA and protein expression in 57 cases of MPO enzyme-negative infant B-precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), since the blast cells in this condition have been reported to show a high incidence of coexpression of myeloid-associated antigens. MPO expression was compared with other clinical and laboratory parameters. Of the cases examined, 56% showed detectable MPO expression at the RNA or protein level or both. Most positive cases showed MPO protein in many leukemic blasts, whereas a few cases showed substantial MPO protein expression in only a few blast cells. MPO expression showed no significant correlation with other markers of myeloid differentiation. Leukemic lymphoblasts in infant ALL frequently express MPO at the RNA or protein level; this expression does not imply an overall myeloid phenotype. The leukemic blasts in infant ALL may derive from an immature hematopoietic precursor cell not fully committed to lymphoid differentiation.","['Austin, G E', 'Alvarado, C S', 'Austin, E D', 'Hakami, N', 'Zhao, W G', 'Chauvenet, A', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Carroll, A J']","['Austin GE', 'Alvarado CS', 'Austin ED', 'Hakami N', 'Zhao WG', 'Chauvenet A', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll AJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Decatur, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Peroxidase/analysis/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/immunology', 'RNA/analysis']",1998/11/05 00:00,1998/11/05 00:01,['1998/11/05 00:00'],"['1998/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/110.5.575 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Nov;110(5):575-81. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/110.5.575.,,"['CA-05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low concentrations of the pleuromutilin-derived semi-synthetic antibiotic tiamulin (0.1 to 10 microM) sensitized the three highly resistant P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-overexpressing tumor cell lines P388 (murine lymphoid leukemia), AS30-D (rat hepatoma), CEM (human lymphoblastic leukemia), and the barely resistant AS30-D/S cell lines to several MDR-related anticancer drugs. Flow cytometric analysis showed that tiamulin significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of daunomycin. When compared to reference modulating agents such as verapamil and cyclosporin A, tiamulin proved to be 1.1 to 8.3 times more efficient in sensitizing the resistant cell lines. Moreover, when given i.p. (1.6 microg/mg body weight), tiamulin increased the survival rate of adriamycin-treated mice bearing the P388/ADR25 tumor line by 29%. In the presence of an anticancer drug, tiamulin inhibited both ATPase and drug transport activities of Pgp in plasma membranes from tumor cells. Tiamulin is thus a potent chemosensitizer that antagonizes the Pgp-mediated chemoresistance in many tumor cell lines expressing the MDR phenotype at different levels and displays no toxic effects on contractile tissues at active doses, therefore providing the promise for potential clinical applications.","['Baggetto, L G', 'Dong, M', 'Bernaud, J', 'Espinosa, L', 'Rigal, D', 'Bonvallet, R', 'Marthinet, E']","['Baggetto LG', 'Dong M', 'Bernaud J', 'Espinosa L', 'Rigal D', 'Bonvallet R', 'Marthinet E']","['Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Proteines, UPR 412 CNRS, Lyon, France. lg.baggetto@ibcp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'E38WZ4U54R (tiamulin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacokinetics']",1998/11/05 00:00,1998/11/05 00:01,['1998/11/05 00:00'],"['1998/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00229-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00229-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Nov 1;56(9):1219-28. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00229-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LAK cells were generated from healthy volunteers. Cell surface markers were determined by a flow cytometry test. The ATL and non-ATL cell lines were killed by the LAK cells, markedly or moderately. However, the OKM-2T was scarcely killed. The adhesion tendency of the OKM-2T to the LAK cells was preserved at the same level as that of the other cell lines, whereas the OKM-2T showed low levels of adhesion molecules CD58 (LFA-3), CD86, and CD106 (VCAM-1). We determined blocking tests using specific antibodies. Anti-CD58 blocked the LAK lysis. Anti-CD54 and anti-CD106 enhanced the blocking effect of the anti-CD58; anti-CD86 did not show such an effect. These results suggest that the low expression of CD58 in the OKM-2T may have an intimate relationship with LAK resistance, and that the low expression of CD106 may also be responsible for it, in part.","['Komatsu, F', 'Kajiwara, M']","['Komatsu F', 'Kajiwara M']","['Blood Transfusion Service, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'CD58 Antigens/analysis/*physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis/*physiology']",1998/11/05 00:00,1998/11/05 00:01,['1998/11/05 00:00'],"['1998/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1998;10(5):263-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry with electrothermal atomization. The Cr levels were increased in hemodialysis patients-HD (3.67 +/- 0.35 micrograms/L) compared to controls-C (0.40 +/- 0.12 microgram/L), in significantly changed in diabetic patients-DM (0.29 +/- 0.08 microgram/L) and patients with lymphoproliferative disease-LP (0.24 +/- 0.07 microgram/L), and decreased in hyperlipidemic patients-HL (0.15 +/- 0.03 microgram/L). There were no differences in Cr concentration between DM treated by diet or peroral antidiabetic drugs; likewise hypolipidemic drugs in HL did not change the Cr concentration. The biochemical parameters-total protein, transferrin in LP group, glucose in DM group, total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and A-I did not correlate with serum Cr concentration. However, the HDL-cholesterol concentration marginally significantly (p < 0.07) correlated with it. The role of Cr in humans has not yet been fully characterized. To prevent some complications in patients, it may be important to monitor the Cr levels. Chromium supplementation may be indicated in some diseases with no controversy concerning the importance of decreased serum and/or tissue levels and documented positive effects of Cr supplementation on the quality of life (e.g. hyperlipidemia).","['Zima, T', 'Mestek, O', 'Tesar, V', 'Tesarova, P', 'Nemecek, K', 'Zak, A', 'Zeman, M']","['Zima T', 'Mestek O', 'Tesar V', 'Tesarova P', 'Nemecek K', 'Zak A', 'Zeman M']","['1st Institute of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Blood Proteins/analysis', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Chromium/*blood', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Renal Insufficiency/*blood', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Transferrin/analysis']",1998/11/05 00:00,1998/11/05 00:01,['1998/11/05 00:00'],"['1998/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15216549800203872 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1998 Oct;46(2):365-74. doi: 10.1080/15216549800203872.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated this drug in patients with APL in an attempt to elucidate its mechanism of action. METHODS: Twelve patients with APL who had relapsed after extensive prior therapy were treated with arsenic trioxide at doses ranging from 0.06 to 0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day until visible leukemic cells were eliminated from the bone marrow. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were serially monitored by flow cytometry for immunophenotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for PML-RAR-alpha fusion transcripts, and Western blot analysis for expression of the apoptosis-associated proteins caspases 1, 2, and 3. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients studied, 11 achieved complete remission after treatment that lasted from 12 to 39 days (range of cumulative doses, 160 to 495 mg). Adverse effects were relatively mild and included rash, lightheadedness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. Cells that expressed both CD11b and CD33 (antigens characteristic of mature and immature cells, respectively), and which were found by fluorescence in situ hybridization to carry the t(15;17) translocation, increased progressively in number during treatment and persisted in the early phase of complete remission. Eight of 11 patients who initially tested positive for the PML-RAR-alpha fusion transcript by the RT-PCR assay later tested negative; 3 other patients, who persistently tested positive, relapsed early. Arsenic trioxide induced the expression of the proenzymes of caspase 2 and caspase 3 and activation of both caspase 1 and caspase 3. CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of arsenic trioxide can induce complete remissions in patients with APL who have relapsed. The clinical response is associated with incomplete cytodifferentiation and the induction of apoptosis with caspase activation in leukemic cells.","['Soignet, S L', 'Maslak, P', 'Wang, Z G', 'Jhanwar, S', 'Calleja, E', 'Dardashti, L J', 'Corso, D', 'DeBlasio, A', 'Gabrilove, J', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Soignet SL', 'Maslak P', 'Wang ZG', 'Jhanwar S', 'Calleja E', 'Dardashti LJ', 'Corso D', 'DeBlasio A', 'Gabrilove J', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Developmental Chemotherapy Services, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Caspases', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/drug effects', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods']",1998/11/05 03:01,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/05 03:01'],"['1998/11/05 03:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/05 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199811053391901 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Nov 5;339(19):1341-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199811053391901.,,"['CA-09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-001364/FD/FDA HHS/United States']","['N Engl J Med. 1998 Nov 5;339(19):1389-91.

Here we report that olvanil is a stable and potent inhibitor of AEA facilitated transport into rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Olvanil blocked both the uptake and the hydrolysis of [14C]AEA by intact RBL-2H3 cells (IC50 = 9 microM), while capsaicin and pseudocapsaicin (N-vanillyl-nonanamide) were much less active. Olvanil was more potent than previously reported inhibitors of AEA facilitated transport, i.e. phloretin (IC50 = 80 microM), AM404 (12.9% inhibition at 10 microM) or oleoylethanolamide (27.5% inhibition at 10 microM). Olvanil was a poor inhibitor of [14C]AEA hydrolysis by RBL-2H3 and N18TG2 cell membranes, suggesting that the inhibitory effect on [14C]AEA breakdown observed in intact cells was due to inhibition of [14C]AEA uptake. Olvanil was stable to enzymatic hydrolysis, and (i) displaced the binding of high affinity cannabinoid receptor ligands to membrane preparations from N18TG2 cells and guinea pig forebrain (Ki = 1.64-7.08 microM), but not from cells expressing the CB2 cannabinoid receptor subtype; (ii) inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP formation in intact N18TG2 cells (IC50 = 1.60 microM), this effect being reversed by the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716A. Pseudocapsaicin, but not capsaicin, also selectively bound to CB1 receptor-containing membranes. These data suggest that some of the analgesic actions of olvanil may be due to its interactions with the endogenous cannabinoid system, and may lead to the design of a novel class of cannabimimetics with potential therapeutic applications as analgesics.","['Di Marzo, V', 'Bisogno, T', 'Melck, D', 'Ross, R', 'Brockie, H', 'Stevenson, L', 'Pertwee, R', 'De Petrocellis, L']","['Di Marzo V', 'Bisogno T', 'Melck D', 'Ross R', 'Brockie H', 'Stevenson L', 'Pertwee R', 'De Petrocellis L']","['Istituto per la Chimica di Molecole di Interesse Biologico, CNR, Napoli, Italy. vdm@trinc.icmib.na.cnr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '4P7KIU7003 (olvanil)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators', 'Cannabinoids/*pharmacokinetics', 'Capsaicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Drug/agonists/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/04 00:00,1998/11/04 00:01,['1998/11/04 00:00'],"['1998/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(98)01175-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01175-2 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1998 Oct 9;436(3):449-54. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01175-2.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results, in conjunction with historical cytogenetic data, suggest that a putative growth control locus lies distal to the thymidine kinase (Tk1) gene, near the telomere. Thirty seven mutants were hybridized with a chromosome 11-specific whole chromosome painting probe for analysis of rearrangements. Generally, painting confirmed earlier observations that large colony mutants are karyotypically normal, whereas small colony mutants frequently have detectable rearrangements. A point probe distal to Tk1 revealed no evidence of chromosome breakage in small colony mutants that appeared normal on whole 11 painting and had no LOH. Therefore, the molecular difference between large and small colony mutants remains unknown. Models to explain large and small colony mutants consistent with our findings are presented, including loss of a putative growth control gene, differential mechanisms of chromosome breakage/repair and second site mutations as explanations for small colony mutants. Painting revealed translocations and aneuploidy and showed that non-disjunction was not a common explanation for complete LOH. The most common finding was that large regions of LOH do not result from deletions, demonstrating that these cells can detect recombination events as well as previously observed chromosomal rearrangements, deletions and point mutations.","['Liechty, M C', 'Scalzi, J M', 'Sims, K R', 'Crosby, H Jr', 'Spencer, D L', 'Davis, L M', 'Caspary, W J', 'Hozier, J C']","['Liechty MC', 'Scalzi JM', 'Sims KR', 'Crosby H Jr', 'Spencer DL', 'Davis LM', 'Caspary WJ', 'Hozier JC']","['Applied Genetics Laboratories Inc., Melbourne, FL 32901, USA.

Because Trp53 (the mouse homolog of human TP53) is located with Tk1 on chromosome 11 and is critical in regulating cellular responses following exposure to DNA damaging agents, we wanted to determine if these mouse lymphoma cells harbor mutations in Trp53. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of PCR-amplified exons 4-9 of Trp53 indicated mutations in both exons 4 and 5. We sequenced exons 4-9 from isolated clones of Tk(+/-)-3.7.2C cells and a Tk-/- mutant (G4). Mutant G4 has two copies of the chromosome carrying the Tk1- allele and no copy of the chromosome carrying the Tk1+ allele and thus could establish linkage of the individual Trp53 and Tk1 alleles. DNA sequence analysis revealed no mutations in exons 6-9 in any Tk(+/-)-3.7.2C or G4 clones. As suggested by SSCP, there was a nonsense mutation in exon 4 at bp 301 (codon 101) in one Trp53 allele. Tk(+/-)-3.7.2C clones have both mutant and wild-type sequences at bp 301; G4 clones have wild-type exon 4 sequence. These data allow assignment of the Trp53 exon 4 mutated allele to chromosome 11 carrying the Tk1+ allele. The exon 4 mutation leads to a stop codon early in translation, thus functionally deleting the Trp53 allele on the Tk1(+)-bearing chromosome. As previously reported, we find a missense mutation in exon 5 at bp 517 (codon 173) in one Trp53 allele. Using the G4 clones we determined that the exon 5 mutation is linked to the Tk1- allele. Thus the Tk +/-(-)3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells have two mutant Trp53 alleles, likely accounting for their rapid cell growth and contributing to their ability to detect the major types of mutational damage associated with the etiology of tumor development. This ability to integrate across the mutational events seen in the multiple stages of tumor development further supports the use of the assay in chemical and drug safety studies and its recommendation as part of the required screening battery for regulatory agency submissions.","['Clark, L S', 'Hart, D W', 'Vojta, P J', 'Harrington-Brock, K', 'Barrett, J C', 'Moore, M M', 'Tindall, K R']","['Clark LS', 'Hart DW', 'Vojta PJ', 'Harrington-Brock K', 'Barrett JC', 'Moore MM', 'Tindall KR']","['University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA. clark.scott@epamail.epa.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Codon/genetics', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', '*Genes, p53', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*standards', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",1998/11/04 00:00,1998/11/04 00:01,['1998/11/04 00:00'],"['1998/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/13.5.427 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1998 Sep;13(5):427-34. doi: 10.1093/mutage/13.5.427.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell type-specific increase in LAL expression is further investigated in the THP-1 cell line with respect to transcriptional regulation. The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters. In order to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA)-enhanced promoter activity, we performed deletion analysis and reporter gene assays. A PMA responsive element has been identified between -182 bp and -107 bp upstream of the major transcription start site. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells. Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression.

These data suggest that LY6H may play a role(s) in both the central nervous system and the immune system.","['Horie, M', 'Okutomi, K', 'Taniguchi, Y', 'Ohbuchi, Y', 'Suzuki, M', 'Takahashi, E']","['Horie M', 'Okutomi K', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Ohbuchi Y', 'Suzuki M', 'Takahashi E']","['Otsuka GEN Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 463-10 Kagasuno, Kawauchi-cho, Tokushima, 771-0192, Japan. mhorie@otsuka.gr.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/04 00:00,1998/11/04 00:01,['1998/11/04 00:00'],"['1998/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888754398954623 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1998.5462 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1998 Nov 1;53(3):365-8. doi: 10.1006/geno.1998.5462.,['GENBANK/AB012293'],,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Dialysis of the cells with 10 microM free Ca2+ and 300 microM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[gamma-S]) resulted in prominent capacitance increases. However, dialysis with either Ca2+ (225 nM to 10 microM) or GTP[gamma-S] alone failed to induce a capacitance change. Under conditions of weak Ca2+ buffering (0.1 mM EGTA), activation of Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels by dialysis with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) failed to induce a capacitance increase even in the presence of GTP[gamma-S]. However, when Ca2+ATPases were inhibited by thapsigargin, InsP3 and GTP[gamma-S] led to a pronounced elevation in membrane capacitance. This increase was dependent on a rise in intracellular Ca2+ because it was abolished when cells were dialysed with a high level of EGTA (10 mM) in the recording pipette. The increase was also dependent on Ca2+ influx because it was effectively suppressed when external Ca2+ was removed. Our results demonstrate that ICRAC represents an important source of Ca2+ for triggering a secretory response.","['Artalejo, A R', 'Ellory, J C', 'Parekh, A B']","['Artalejo AR', 'Ellory JC', 'Parekh AB']","['Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Dialysis', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', '*Electric Conductivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Rats', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/pl00008088 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 1998 Nov;436(6):934-9. doi: 10.1007/pl00008088.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a decrease in the levels of intracellular ATP, achieved using the mitochondrial poison antimycin and the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, as well as a reduction of glycolysis by removal of external glucose, ICRAC activated in a manner similar to control cells when stores are depleted by dialysis with a pipette solution containing either inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP3) or ionomycin together with a high concentration of EGTA. Dialysis of cells for 150 s with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) (2 mM) in addition to the mitochondrial inhibitors also failed to prevent activation of ICRAC following external application of ionomycin and thapsigargin, when compared with control recordings obtained with 2 mM ATP instead. Ca2+-dependent vesicular fusion was triggered by dialysing cells with 10 microM Ca2+ and guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTP[gamma-S]).

We have analyzed the function of the Rho proteins Rac1 and CDC42 in the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI)-mediated phagocytosis using transfected rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells expressing dominant inhibitory forms of CDC42 and Rac1. Binding of opsonized particles to untransfected RBL-2H3 cells led to the accumulation of F-actin at the site of contact with the particles and further, to particle internalization. This process was inhibited by Clostridium difficile toxin B, a general inhibitor of Rho GTP-binding proteins. Dominant inhibition of Rac1 or CDC42 function severely inhibited particle internalization but not F-actin accumulation. Inhibition of CDC42 function resulted in the appearance of pedestal-like structures with particles at their tips, while particles bound at the surface of the Rac1 mutant cell line were enclosed within thin membrane protrusions that did not fuse. These phenotypic differences indicate that Rac1 and CDC42 have distinct functions and may act cooperatively in the assembly of the phagocytic cup. Inhibition of phagocytosis in the mutant cell lines was accompanied by the persistence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins around bound particles. Phagocytic cup closure and particle internalization were also blocked when phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with phenylarsine oxide, an inhibitor of protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Altogether, our data show that Rac1 and CDC42 are required to coordinate actin filament organization and membrane extension to form phagocytic cups and to allow particle internalization during FcR-mediated phagocytosis. Our data also suggest that Rac1 and CDC42 are involved in phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation required for particle internalization.","['Massol, P', 'Montcourrier, P', 'Guillemot, J C', 'Chavrier, P']","['Massol P', 'Montcourrier P', 'Guillemot JC', 'Chavrier P']","[""Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille-Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (toxB protein, Clostridium difficile)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', '*Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phagocytosis/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zymosan/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/17.21.6219 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1998 Nov 2;17(21):6219-29. doi: 10.1093/emboj/17.21.6219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1170948,,,,

To aid the structure/function characterization of the MHR, the structures of synthetic peptides encompassing the MHR of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) capsid proteins were investigated by several techniques. Homology-based secondary-structure prediction suggested that the HIV-1 and MoMLV peptides could form 50% and 38% alpha-helix, respectively. CD studies indicated that, in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol, the HIV-1 peptide adopts an alpha-helical structure over half of its length, while the MoMLV peptide is over one third alpha-helix. Further analysis by 1H-NMR suggested that the C-terminal portion of the MHR of each virus forms a helix in aqueous solution. Distance-geometry structures of each peptide were calculated from NOE distance restraints and were refined by restrained molecular dynamics. The C-terminal halves of both peptides were observed to be in an alpha-helical conformation, while the N-terminal halves were disordered. Furthermore, both helices were amphipathic with high conservation of amino acid side-chain character, suggesting that a conserved helical MHR C-terminus is essential to retroviral capsid protein function.","['Clish, C B', 'Peyton, D H', 'Barklis, E']","['Clish CB', 'Peyton DH', 'Barklis E']","['Department of Chemistry, Portland State University, Oregon 97207-0751, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,['0 (Solutions)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid/*chemistry', 'HIV-1/*chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Solutions']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2570069.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1998 Oct 1;257(1):69-77. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2570069.x.,,"['2R01 CA47088-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 GM52914-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates. RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.","['Little, M P', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Little MP', 'Muirhead CR']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Didcot, Oxon, UK. mark.little@nrpb.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530098141348 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1998 Oct;74(4):471-80. doi: 10.1080/095530098141348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain insight into the contribution of excitatory amino acids to the neurodegeneration observed in these mice, their concentrations were measured in the CSF and striatal microdialysates. Glutamate concentrations were significantly elevated in CSF but not plasma as early as 4 weeks postinoculation. Steady-state glutamate levels in striatal microdialysates were increased threefold and could be reduced 40% by application of L-alpha-aminoadipate, an inhibitor of microglial glutamate transport. Stimulation of infected mice with KCl/L-trans-2,4-pyrrolidine dicarboxylate further increased glutamate levels 170-270% above those evoked in control mice. Tetrodotoxin suppressed the depolarization-evoked increase in glutamate by 88% in control mice, but it had only negligible effects in 40% of infected mice. Analysis of glutamate transport and catabolism suggests that abnormal astrocytic function does not contribute to the increase in basal extracellular glutamate levels. These findings are the first direct evidence that infection with an immunodeficiency-inducing retrovirus leads to a chronic elevation of extracellular free glutamate levels in the brain, which contributes to the neurodegenerative and cognitive deficits observed in these mice.","['Espey, M G', 'Kustova, Y', 'Sei, Y', 'Basile, A S']","['Espey MG', 'Kustova Y', 'Sei Y', 'Basile AS']","['Laboratory of Neuroscience, National Institute of Digestive Disorders and Kidney, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0008, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Amino Acid Transport System X-AG)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Complex/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Transport System X-AG', 'Amino Acids/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Corpus Striatum/metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/*metabolism', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Glutamic Acid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microdialysis', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Time Factors']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1998.71052079.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1998 Nov;71(5):2079-87. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1998.71052079.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ET- and PE-treated cultures contained the same number of beating cells as control, but LIF and PGF2alpha treatment increased the number of beating cells 180%. Treatment with LIF, PE, and PGF2alpha increased the beat rate to 3.3 times that of control. After exposure to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the beat rate increased 50% for PGF2alpha' 54% for PE, 84% for LIF, and 125% for control. ET treatment did not increase the beat rate, nor did these cells respond to isoproterenol. ET, LIF, and PE increased the production of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) by three-fold and PGF2alpha by 18-fold over nontreated cells. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was increased fourfold by ET and PE, 16-fold by LIF, and 29-fold by PGF2alpha. Interestingly, on a pmol/L basis, only LIF induced more BNP than ANP. Treatment with all agents led to a similar pattern of gene induction: increased expression of the embryonic genes for ANP and skeletal alpha-actin, and less than a twofold change in the constitutively expressed gene myosin light chain-2, with the exception that LIF did not induce skeletal alpha-actin. Each agent, however, induced ANP mRNA with a different time-course. We conclude that at least four distinct cardiac myocyte hypertrophy response programs can be induced in vitro. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these correlate to the different types of cardiac hypertrophy seen in vivo.","['King, K L', 'Winer, J', 'Phillips, D M', 'Quach, J', 'Williams, P M', 'Mather, J P']","['King KL', 'Winer J', 'Phillips DM', 'Quach J', 'Williams PM', 'Mather JP']","['Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. king3@gene.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Endothelins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)']",IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cardiomegaly/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dinoprost/*pharmacology', 'Endothelins/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Myocardium/*pathology', 'Phenylephrine/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Rats']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/01/01 00:00 [received]', '1998/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '1998/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['ENDO:9:1:45 [pii]', '10.1385/endo:9:1:45 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrine. 1998 Aug;9(1):45-55. doi: 10.1385/endo:9:1:45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant myc gene expression in transgenic mice is correlated with B cell lymphomagenesis. We generated a unique transgenic mouse model in which deregulated murine E mu-N-myc transgene expression leads to development of indolent B cell lymphoma. Tumor cells were monoclonal, morphologically mature and surface immunoglobulin expressing B cells. Tumors arose in a disease course and exhibited a cytoarchitectural appearance reminiscent of human follicular lymphoma. Yet tumor cells were staged as preB since they failed to rearrange the immunoglobulin light chain genes. Retroviral insertion mutagenesis analyses of adult transgenic mice infected as newborns with murine leukemia virus revealed decreased disease latency, increased lymphoma incidence and a histologically more mature tumor type. Proviral insertion sites were not equivalent when accelerated E mu-N-myc indolent lymphomas were compared to accelerated c-myc preB cell lymphomas. The bcl-2 gene was not disrupted in either spontaneous or provirally accelerated E mu-N-myc lymphomas. These findings suggest that tumor progression in N-myc-associated indolent B cell lymphoma can proceed along diverse pathways involving distinctly different combinations of deregulated and/or intact genes than those pathways described in highly aggressive forms of myc-related murine preB cell disease.","['Sheppard, R D', 'Samant, S A', 'Rosenberg, M', 'Silver, L M', 'Cole, M D']","['Sheppard RD', 'Samant SA', 'Rosenberg M', 'Silver LM', 'Cole MD']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*physiology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202125 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Oct 22;17(16):2073-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202125.,,['CA39192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, peripheral blood lymphocytes from fifty-one patients with B-CLL were sequentially karyotyped over a mean interval of 13.8 months (range, one to 51 months). Cytogenetic clones were detected in 33/51 patients (66%) on initial study, including 17 patients with structural abnormalities of chromosome 13q14, and three patients with trisomy 12. Karyotypic evolution was documented in 22/51 patients (43%). The most common secondarily acquired chromosome aberrations were structural abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 6 involving the region of 6q21-q24 (six patients). Four patients each had acquired structural abnormalities of 1q, 3p, 12q, and 13q. Disease progression, as measured by advance in Rai stage or death from the disease, was observed more often in the clonal evolution group than in the karyotypically stable group (11/22 vs. 5/29; P = 0.017). Patients with secondary abnormalities of 6q had a significantly decreased progression-free survival interval compared with other patients in the study (P = .023). The authors conclude that clonal karyotypic evolution is common in B-CLL, and that clonal evolution correlates with clinical disease progression. Furthermore, the poor outcomes previously attributed to CLL with 6q abnormalities may be related to the clonal acquisition of these abnormalities over time. Future studies should focus on the relevant genetic events underlying the clinical progression observed with karyotypic evolution of B-CLL.","['Finn, W G', 'Kay, N E', 'Kroft, S H', 'Church, S', 'Peterson, L C']","['Finn WG', 'Kay NE', 'Kroft SH', 'Church S', 'Peterson LC']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois, USA. wgfinn@path.med.umich.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1998/11/03 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/03 03:02'],"['1998/11/03 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/03 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199811)59:3<223::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199811)59:3<223::aid-ajh7>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1998 Nov;59(3):223-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199811)59:3<223::aid-ajh7>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,1087-92,"BACKGROUND: Transplantation of blood or bone-marrow stem cells is the treatment of choice for selected patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Transplantation is used with increasing frequency and success, but remains associated with substantial risks of morbidity and mortality. Other treatments with satisfactory short-term outcome are available. For appropriate counselling of patients, a rapid and simple way to assess risk is needed. METHODS: Data from 3142 patients (1873 [60%] male, 1269 [40%] female; mean age 34 years, range <1-60 years) treated with allogeneic blood or marrow transplants for CML between 1989 and 1997, reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), were used to develop and test a simple risk score based on previously reported major pretransplant risk factors: histocompatibility, stage of disease at time of transplantation, age and sex of donor and recipient, and time from diagnosis to transplantation. We analysed probabilities of survival, leukaemia-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse incidence with respect to these risk factors. FINDINGS: At the time of analysis, 1922 (61%) of the 3142 patients were alive-1567 (65%) of those with HLA-identical sibling donors and 417 (57%) of those with unrelated donors. 1682 (54%) were alive without relapse. 1220 (39%) patients had died, 1013 (83%) of transplant-related causes, 207 (17%) of relapse. 447 (14%) patients had relapsed. The final scoring system was highly predictive for leukaemia-free survival, survival and transplant-related mortality. Survival at 5 years was 72%, 70%, 62%, 48%, 40%, 18%, and 22% for patients with scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Risk of transplant-related mortality was 20%, 23%, 31%, 46%, 51%, 71%, and 73%. Data showed the same trends for HLA-identical sibling transplants and unrelated transplants for transplants done in 1989-93 and 1994-96. INTERPRETATION: Pretransplant risk factors are cumulative for individual patients with CML having blood or marrow transplantation.

The extent and severity of skin manifestations in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are prognostic indicators of extracutaneous involvement. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprise 10% to 25% of all primary cutaneous non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and are classified according to their cell of origin. Most cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an indolent course and excellent prognosis when compared to their nodal counterparts. Many factors have been implicated in the etiology of cutaneous lymphomas, including chemical and drug exposures, as well as microbial agents, such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphocyte virus-1 (HTLV-1), and Borrelia burgdorferi.

In recent years, several gene therapy procedures making use of retroviral vectors that selectively target HIV susceptible cells have been proposed in order to interfere with HIV productive infection. However, the HIV glycoproteins' inability to be incorporated in other heterologous retroviruses considerably limits true HIV cell tropism of such vectors. We now report the use of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) viral particles harboring a truncated form of the HIV glycoprotein for specific gene delivery. Reporter lacZ gene transfer was determined to be appropriately specific to CD4+ cells when HeLaCD4 cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were infected with these pseudotyped MuLV virus vectors. In contrast, MuLV viruses harboring amphotropic MuLV envelope glycoproteins displayed a broad and nonspecific infection of PBL subpopulations. This new approach, taking advantage of the ability of truncated HIV envelope glycoproteins to be incorporated into heterologous retroviral particles, may foreseeably be used in future interventions based on the coordinated delivery of therapeutic gene products specifically to cell types susceptible to HIV infection.","['Lodge, R', 'Subbramanian, R A', 'Forget, J', 'Lemay, G', 'Cohen, E A']","['Lodge R', 'Subbramanian RA', 'Forget J', 'Lemay G', 'Cohen EA']","['Departement de Microbiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300646 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1998 May;5(5):655-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vector provides high-level expression of the coselected gene in approximately 90% of transduced cells and has been used to express an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted single-chain antibody (intrabody) directed against a subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor, IL-2R alpha. In the established T cell line Kit225 and also in primary human T cells stably transduced with the intrabody vector, the cell surface expression of IL-2R alpha could be reduced to a low or undetectable level. Responsiveness to IL-2 was reduced 10-fold in the IL-2R alpha-negative cells, consistent with a lack of high-affinity IL-2 receptors. Pseudotyping of the HIV-1 core with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein improved particle stability by two- to three-fold and enhanced vector entry into established T cell lines up to 230-fold. Vector entry into primary human T cells was most efficient when the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope was used.

Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer is therefore not possible in cells that fail to express sufficient levels of the appropriate receptor, representing one major obstacle to the use of recombinant retroviruses in experimental and clinical applications. In this study, we utilized an adenoviral vector to express transiently the receptor for the ecotropic murine leukemia virus in a panel of human cell lines. Following adenoviral infection, the susceptibility to ecotropic retroviral particles of A549, HeLa, RC39 and Meso 33 cells, derived from human lung epithelium, cervical epithelium, kidney and mesothelium, respectively, was measured on a single-cell basis by the detection of a cell surface marker encoded by the recombinant retrovirus. The marker, termed NTP, was found in 10-30%, 25-50% and 50-90% of cells infected at 5, 50 and 250 adenovirus multiplicity of infection, respectively. Southern blot analysis demonstrated the integration of intact retroviral DNA. The integrated vector copy number increased with the adenoviral multiplicity of infection, suggesting that retrovirus infection is proportional to receptor expression by the target cell, albeit not in a linear fashion. Susceptibility to ecotropic retroviral infection was maintained undiminished for at least 3 days, indicating the persistent expression of ecotropic receptor by the adenovirus-transduced cells in that time period and the lack of a major cellular defense triggered by adenovirus infection against the subsequent retroviral infection. Thus, the infection of human cells of various tissues with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor generates a window of susceptibility where a high retroviral infection rate can be achieved. Increased efficiency of retroviral infection obtained in this fashion is amenable to specific regulation via the controlled expression of the adenovirus-encoded retroviral receptor.","['Scott-Taylor, T H', 'Gallardo, H F', 'Gansbacher, B', 'Sadelain, M']","['Scott-Taylor TH', 'Gallardo HF', 'Gansbacher B', 'Sadelain M']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300633 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1998 May;5(5):621-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300633.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that the ara-C-sensitising potency of the antisignalling agents is equipotent with that of the ribonucleotide inhibitors. The cytotoxicity, determined by the 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl-)5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, of combinations of ara-C with the agents named above was compared in the leukaemia cell lines HL-60, ara-C-resistant HL-60 (HL-60/ara-C) and U937. Furthermore, a range of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein, CGP 52411, tyrphostin A48 and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), for which ara-C-sensitisation has hitherto not been described, were included in the study. All three cell types acquired increased sensitivity to ara-C when co-incubated with HU or ATRA, but their ara-C sensitivity was not affected by quercetin or genistein. 2-CdA, CGP 52411, tyrphostin A48, staurosporine and NDGA were active as sensitisers against ara-C in HL-60 cells, CGP 52411 and tyrphostin A48 also in HL-60/ara-C cells, and 2-CdA, staurosporine and NDGA also in U937 cells. F-Ara-A increased ara-C toxicity in HL-60/ara-C and U937 cells. To address the mechanism of the observed sensitisation, the influence of agents with ara-C-sensitising properties on ara-C-induced apoptosis was investigated in HL-60 cells as measured by cell shrinkage, DNA loss and DNA fragmentation. HU, ATRA, tyrphostin A48 and NDGA augmented apoptosis induced by ara-C as assessed by all three indicators. CGP 52411 decreased the effect of ara-C on apoptotic indicators after incubation for 4 h, but not after 12 h. The results suggest that ATRA, CGP 52411, tyrphostin A48, staurosporine and NDGA may be suitable alternatives to the clinically applied ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors as modifiers of ara-C cytotoxicity in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Freund, A', 'Boos, J', 'Harkin, S', 'Schultze-Mosgau, M', 'Veerman, G', 'Peters, G J', 'Gescher, A']","['Freund A', 'Boos J', 'Harkin S', 'Schultze-Mosgau M', 'Veerman G', 'Peters GJ', 'Gescher A']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(97)10149-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(97)10149-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1998 May;34(6):895-901. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(97)10149-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore that possibility, survivors of brain tumours in childhood, all of whom had received radiotherapy, were examined for evidence of bone mineral loss. 19 children were assessed, on average at 7 years after treatment. Measurements of growth velocities, plain radiography of the skeleton, bone densitometry, health-related quality of life and physical activity were undertaken. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency had been detected in 6 children and 5 had received GH replacement, for a minimum of more than 3 years. 9 children were radiographically osteopenic (including the 5 who had received GH). Z scores for bone mineral density (BMD) were negative in the majority of children. Health-related quality of life was less and pain more frequent in those with low BMD scores. Pain was correlated negatively with both free-time activity and seasonal activity (P < 0.01). Osteopenia is a common sequel of therapy in children with brain tumours. Those with osteopenia have more pain and more compromised, health-related quality of life than those who are not osteopenic, and pain significantly limits physical activity. The pathogenesis of osteopenia in these children is still uncertain, but is likely to be multifactorial.","['Barr, R D', 'Simpson, T', 'Webber, C E', 'Gill, G J', 'Hay, J', 'Eves, M', 'Whitton, A C']","['Barr RD', 'Simpson T', 'Webber CE', 'Gill GJ', 'Hay J', 'Eves M', 'Whitton AC']","[""Children's Hospital at Chedoke-McMaster, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Quality of Life', 'Survivors']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(98)00011-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00011-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1998 May;34(6):873-7. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00011-2.,,,['Eur J Cancer. 1998 May;34(6):770-2.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Height and body mass index standard deviation scores were measured in 33 patients (14 boys and 19 girls) with childhood ALL at diagnosis, after the end of treatment, at final height, and at follow up 10-20 years (median, 16.2) after diagnosis. Eleven patients were treated with chemotherapy only and 22 patients were treated with chemotherapy and cranial irradiation. RESULTS: In the chemotherapy only group, height standard deviation scores were the same at follow up as at diagnosis, but there was a significant decrease in height standard deviation scores during treatment. Mean body mass index standard deviation scores increased steadily from the start of treatment until final height and continued to increase from final height until follow up. In the cranially irradiated group, mean height standard deviation scores decreased steadily from the start of treatment until follow up. Mean body mass index standard deviation scores increased continuously from the start of treatment until final height and from final height until follow up. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy combined with cranial irradiation and chemotherapy alone might be persisting risk factors for obesity even after final/height has been attained in patients treated for childhood ALL. Chemotherapy is a risk factor for reduced final height only when administered in combination with cranial irradiation. These problems need to be recognised and dealt with at follow up examination.","['Birkebaek, N H', 'Clausen, N']","['Birkebaek NH', 'Clausen N']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Aarhus at Skejby, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', '*Body Height/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Body Mass Index', '*Body Weight/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.79.2.161 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1998 Aug;79(2):161-4. doi: 10.1136/adc.79.2.161.,,,['Arch Dis Child. 1999 Mar;80(3):300-1.

In vitro in the presence of serum, stem cell proliferation is predominantly mediated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) whereas neuronal differentiation can be triggered by FGF-1 in association with a specific heparan sulphate proteoglycan. On the other hand, astrocyte differentiation in vivo and in vitro appears to be dependent on signalling through the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). The evidence suggests that in the absence of LIFR signalling, the stem cell population is present at approximately the same frequency and can generate neurons but is blocked from producing astrocytes that express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or have trophic functions. The block can be overcome by other growth factors such as BMP-2/4 or interferon-gamma, providing further evidence that the inhibition to astrocyte development does not result from loss of a precursor population. Signalling through the LIFR, in addition to stimulating astrocyte differentiation, may also inhibit neuronal differentiation, which may explain why this receptor is expressed at the earliest stages of neurogenesis. Another signalling system which also exerts its influence on neurogenesis through active inhibition is Delta-Notch. We show in vitro that at high cell densities which impede neuronal production by FGF-1, lowering the levels of expression of the receptor Notch by antisense oligonucleotide results in a significant increase in neuronal production. Thus, stem cell differentiation appears to be dependent on the outcome of interactions between a number of signalling pathways, some which promote specific lineages and some which inhibit.","['Bartlett, P F', 'Brooker, G J', 'Faux, C H', 'Dutton, R', 'Murphy, M', 'Turnley, A', 'Kilpatrick, T J']","['Bartlett PF', 'Brooker GJ', 'Faux CH', 'Dutton R', 'Murphy M', 'Turnley A', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. bartlett@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid, delta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/physiology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/physiology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Prosencephalon/*cytology/*embryology', 'Proteoglycans/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Opioid, delta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', '*Transforming Growth Factor beta']",1998/11/03 00:00,1998/11/03 00:01,['1998/11/03 00:00'],"['1998/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['762 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1711.1998.00762.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1998 Oct;76(5):414-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1711.1998.00762.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-eight evaluable patients with relapsed and refractory AML received G-CSF 5 microg/kg per day subcutaneously starting 2 days after the completion of salvage treatment with the S-HAM regimen, consisting of high-dose cytosine arabinoside twice daily on days 1, 2, 8, and 9 and mitoxantrone on days 3, 4, 10, and 11.

All 638 patients were enrolled in the German ALL-BFM 90 and ALL-BFM 95 trials. CD45 was detected on the surface of childhood ALL cells (cut-off > or = 20% positive cells) in only 88.7% (n=566) of all cases. Among 529 patients with childhood B-cell precursor ALL, 12.9% (n=68) did not express CD45, compared with only 3.7% (n=4) of patients with childhood T-lineage ALL (p < 0.001). In the B-cell precursor ALL subtypes, the highest frequency of CD45- cases (15.1%) was observed in common ALL (56/372) compared with only 7.2% in pro-B ALL (3/41) and 7.8% in pre-B ALL (9/116). Assessment of clinical parameters (age, organ enlargement, WBC, etc.) and event-free survival did not reveal significant differences between CD45- and CD45+ patients. Myeloid antigen coexpression was not correlated with CD45 expression. The mean percentage of antigen expression for CD34, CD10, TdT, CD22, and CD24 was significantly higher in children with CD45- B-cell precursor ALL than in those with CD45+ B-cell precursor ALL. In 28 patients with B-cell precursor ALL, cell cycle analyses of freshly isolated leukemic cells were performed with propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow-cytometric analysis. The percentage of cells in S-phase was inversely correlated to the percentage of CD45+ cells (r=-0.48, p < 0.05). With two-parameter analysis of CD45-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and PI-stained cells in nine patients with a percentage of CD45+ cells between 40 and 60%, two populations were distinguishable in a single patient. It was shown that the CD45- subpopulation had a higher percentage of cells in S-phase than the CD45+ subpopulation (10.7 +/- 4.0 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.8, p < 0.007). We conclude that the lack of CD45 expression contributes to the identification of a distinct functional and immunological subgroup of B-cell precursor ALL, but that it has no significant impact on clinical behavior or on therapy outcome in childhood ALL.","['Ratei, R', 'Sperling, C', 'Karawajew, L', 'Schott, G', 'Schrappe, M', 'Harbott, J', 'Riehm, H', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Ratei R', 'Sperling C', 'Karawajew L', 'Schott G', 'Schrappe M', 'Harbott J', 'Riehm H', 'Ludwig WD']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Klinik, Charite Campus Berlin-Buch, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. ratei@rrk-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050424 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Sep;77(3):107-14. doi: 10.1007/s002770050424.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this prospective study was to compare PCR-based Amplification Refractory Mutation System with serology in clinical HLA class I alleles assignment in patients receiving marrow transplants and their potential donors. The total discrepancy rate in 114 consecutively typed individuals for HLA-A and HLA-C alleles was only in favor of ARMS-PCR, whereas HLA-B typing was discrepant also in favor of serology.

As described in this report, the monoclonal antibodies used in these kits were developed by immunizing mice with partially purified protein preparations derived from the urine of patients with bladder cancer. The antigen that is recognized by the monoclonal antibodies was purified from the urine of bladder cancer patients by immunoaffinity chromatography and identified as being either complement factor H (FH) or a closely related protein (CFHrp) by partial amino acid sequence analysis. Like serum FH, the urine antigen was demonstrated to have a complement factor C3b binding site and to accelerate the degradation of C3b in the presence of complement factor I. The culture supernatants from several human bladder, cervical, and renal cancer cell lines contained antigen as determined by immunoassay, and antigen affinity-purified from HeLaS3 culture media was shown to have FH activity. Moreover, the cell lines were shown to make products of the expected sizes by reverse transcription-PCR using FH-specific primers. In contrast, normal human epithelial keratinocytes, a myeloid leukemia cell line, and the colon cancer line LS174T were negative for production of a FH-like protein (CFHrp). We propose that the expression of proteins with FH-like activities may confer a selective growth advantage to cancer cells in vivo by decreasing complement activity, thus aiding their escape from lysis by immune surveillance. Identification of these proteins as cancer products also suggests avenues of chemotherapy or immunotherapy of some cancers.","['Kinders, R', 'Jones, T', 'Root, R', 'Bruce, C', 'Murchison, H', 'Corey, M', 'Williams, L', 'Enfield, D', 'Hass, G M']","['Kinders R', 'Jones T', 'Root R', 'Bruce C', 'Murchison H', 'Corey M', 'Williams L', 'Enfield D', 'Hass GM']","['BION Diagnostic Sciences, Redmond, Washington 98052, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CFH protein, human)', '80295-65-4 (Complement Factor H)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*diagnosis/urine', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Complement Factor H/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Oct;4(10):2511-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The novel antifolates include a polyglutamatable [edatrexate (EDX)] and a lipophilic (trimetrexate) inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase and two polyglutamatable inhibitors (ZD1694 and GW1843U89) and one lipophilic inhibitor (AG337) of thymidylate synthase (TS). Drug activity was assessed via the determination of in situ inhibition of TS activity after exposing leukemic cells to antifolate drugs for: (a) 3 h, followed by a 15-h drug-free period; and (b) 18 h of continuous exposure. For human CEM leukemia cell lines with well-defined mechanisms of resistance to MTX, in situ TS inhibition correlated with the growth-inhibitory effects of MTX and the novel antifolates (r = 0.86-0.93; P < 0.01). Although a wide interpatient variability in MTX sensitivity was observed within the three leukemia groups, the median drug concentration required to inhibit TS activity to 50% of untreated controls (TSI50) for a 3-h exposure to MTX was similar for iALL and rALL cells but was up to 9-fold higher in ANLL cells. After a 3-h exposure, EDX, ZD1694, and GW1843U89 displayed a markedly (10-150-fold) increased potency over MTX in all leukemia groups with comparable TSI50 values for ANLL and iALL cells. Compared with a 3-h MTX exposure, continuous exposure resulted in lower TSI50 values for iALL (14-fold), rALL (14-fold), and ANLL cells (85-fold). In comparison to MTX, the TSI50 values in these groups were also lower for EDX (1.6-3.5-fold), ZD1694 (2.1-4.3-fold), and GW1843U89 (15-35-fold). On short-term exposure, the lipophilic drugs trimetrexate and AG337 displayed markedly less potency as compared with that of long-term exposure. In conclusion, the efficacy of novel antifolates against childhood leukemia cells can be tested with the in situ TS inhibition assay. These novel antifolates displayed a greater efficacy than MTX against childhood leukemia cells and may have potential for the circumvention of MTX resistance in ANLL cells.","['Mauritz, R', 'Bekkenk, M W', 'Rots, M G', 'Pieters, R', 'Mini, E', 'van Zantwijk, C H', 'Veerman, A J', 'Peters, G J', 'Jansen, G']","['Mauritz R', 'Bekkenk MW', 'Rots MG', 'Pieters R', 'Mini E', 'van Zantwijk CH', 'Veerman AJ', 'Peters GJ', 'Jansen G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Oct;4(10):2399-410.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that E47S binds to TCRalpha but not to TCRdelta E-boxes in vitro. Despite this, neither E2-5 nor HEB transactivate the TCRalpha enhancer in NIH 3T3, nor did Id1 modify endogenously driven TCRalpha [alphaE1-4] activity in a TCRalphabeta cell line. We also demonstrate that TAL1 inhibits both binding of E47S to aE3 and aE4 and endogenous transactivation of the TCRalpha enhancer. Comparison of the activity of the minimal [alphaE1-2] fragment, which contains no E-boxes, with the accessory [aE3-4] fragment, which contains two, suggested some contribution from the latter to TCRalpha enhancer activity in HPB-ALL. TCR [alphaE1-2] activity was partially (40%) inhibited by TAL1 but not at all by Id1. In contrast, [alphaE3-4] activity was almost completely inhibited by TAL1 (80%) and slightly reduced by Id1 (15%). These data demonstrate that class A b-HLH regulation of the TCRalpha enhancer E-boxes differs from their B lymphoid Igmicro counterparts and suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional inhibition by TAL1, which may be, at least partly, independent of E-box-mediated activation, as we currently recognize it. They also clearly demonstrate that the restriction of TAL1 deregulation to T-ALL of the TCRalphabeta lineage is not due to induction of TCRalpha enhancer activity by the TAL1 protein.","['Bernard, M', 'Delabesse, E', 'Smit, L', 'Millien, C', 'Kirsch, I R', 'Strominger, J L', 'Macintyre, E A']","['Bernard M', 'Delabesse E', 'Smit L', 'Millien C', 'Kirsch IR', 'Strominger JL', 'Macintyre EA']","['CNRS URA1461, CHU Necker-Enfants Malades and Universite Paris V, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142661-93-6 (TCF12 protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/10.10.1539 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1998 Oct;10(10):1539-49. doi: 10.1093/intimm/10.10.1539.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most subsets of lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are refractory to mitogen stimulation. As a first step to examine proximal signal transduction in the infected mice, Western and Northern blot analyses were performed, and showed that p56lck is dramatically decreased at the protein as well as the mRNA level in the lymph nodes (LN). In contrast, p59(fyn) and its mRNA were slightly increased in the LN of the same mice. Similar results were obtained with purified T cells. Interestingly, the thymus of the infected animals did not show any abnormality regarding p56(lck) or p59(fyn). Tyrosine phosphorylation was constitutively increased in the infected mice and was barely amplified by anti-CD3 mAb stimulation. A similar pattern was observed when tyrosine phosphorylation was selectively examined at the level of ZAP-70.

We observed CD5 antigen expression in a subset of cases of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBL), and we report here five cases. The patients, two men and three women, ranged in age from 59 to 81 years. Biopsy specimens were obtained from kidney, lung, bone marrow, abdominal wall, and neck, the latter involving a lymphangioma. All of the cases had histologic features typical of IVLBL, with large and atypical lymphoid cells located predominantly within blood vessels. Immunohistochemical studies performed using routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections showed that the neoplastic cells were B cells, positive for the CD20 antigen and negative for the CD3 or CD43 antigens. All cases were also positive for the CD5 antigen. One case had an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement shown by using a polymerase chain reaction method. The finding of CD5 antigen expression in a subset of IVLBL cases adds to other evidence in the literature suggesting that IVLBL is a heterogeneous entity. We considered the possibility that these cases were related to or represented unusual histologic forms of transformation from either chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. All of the cases, however, were negative for the CD23 antigen and cyclin D1 (bcl-1) protein, which is evidence against this interpretation. The biologic significance of CD5 antigen expression in cases of IVLBL is uncertain. These neoplasms might arise from a separate lineage of CD5-positive B cells or from a specific, early stage of B-cell differentiation. Alternatively, some investigators have suggested that CD5 antigen expression by B cells is a marker of activation.","['Khalidi, H S', 'Brynes, R K', 'Browne, P', 'Koo, C H', 'Battifora, H', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Khalidi HS', 'Brynes RK', 'Browne P', 'Koo CH', 'Battifora H', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Hemangioendothelioma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kidney Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphangioma/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1998 Oct;11(10):983-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies were also performed with the radiation-induced fibrosarcoma tumor line. An argon-pumped Ti-sapphire laser tuned to deliver light between 710 and 800 nm or an Oriel arc-lamp filtered to deliver broadband light above 590 nm were used as light source. A lipid emulsion was used as the delivery system for sensitizers in all studies. A pronounced solvent dependence was observed for the Q band for each of all iminium salts examined. As an example, the metal-free (BI) derivative had an absorption maximum at 798 nm in dichloromethane and at 727 nm in serum. The action spectra showed a greater PDT response at blue-shifted wavelengths for each of the three iminium salts both in vivo and in vitro. Among the three derivatives, the zinc analog (ZnBI) produced the greatest tumor regression at the low drug/light dose of 0.7 (mumole/kg and 200 J/cm2.

The mTHPC was found to be more potent and selective. At a lethal dosage of 90% killing (LD90), only 1.3 microM of mTHPC and 4.2 kJ/m2 of light irradiation was required, which was a 20-fold lower drug concentration and 11-fold smaller light dose than that required when using MC540. Meanwhile, three times less, or 15%, of the coincubated erythrocytes were destroyed by mTHPC than by MC540. Confocal micrographs showed that both drugs accumulated diffusely inside the cytoplasm in a very similar fashion, but mTHPC induced a more extensive apoptosis in photosensitized JCS cells. For example, at LD90, mTHPC practically killed all JCS cells via apoptosis and cleaved the DNA to extremely small 150 base-pair fragments. In contrast, among the JCS cells killed by MC540, about 88% died via apoptosis and large DNA fragments were abundant. Relative to MC540, the ability of mTHPC to trigger large-scale and thorough apoptosis in leukemia cells may help explain its potency and selectivity.","['Chen, J Y', 'Mak, N K', 'Wen, J M', 'Leung, W N', 'Chen, S C', 'Fung, M C', 'Cheung, N H']","['Chen JY', 'Mak NK', 'Wen JM', 'Leung WN', 'Chen SC', 'Fung MC', 'Cheung NH']","[""Department of Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. nhcheung@hkbu.edu.hk""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Mesoporphyrins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'FU21S769PF (temoporfin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Light', 'Mesoporphyrins/*toxicity', 'Mice', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidinones/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1998 Oct;68(4):545-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One week later, the mice were inoculated with the MAIDS virus to see if the immunization affects progression of MAIDS. It was demonstrated that the immunization significantly delayed progression of MAIDS, although it failed to induce appreciable cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against the P12-10 antigen. In contrast, immunization of B6 mice with the P12-10 coupled with liposome induced substantial CTL responses but failed to protect the mice against MAIDS development. This segregation between CTL activity and in vivo protection efficacy might be worth considering when we exploit vaccines for augmenting cellular immunity mediated by CD8+ T cells.","['Mizuochi, T', 'Horino, A', 'Uchida, T']","['Mizuochi T', 'Horino A', 'Uchida T']","['Department of Bacterial and Blood Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. miz@nih.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', ""0 (incomplete Freund's adjuvant)"", ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Defective Viruses/chemistry/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Disease Progression', ""Freund's Adjuvant/immunology"", 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/immunology', '*Lipids', 'Liposomes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0264410X98000826 [pii]', '10.1016/s0264-410x(98)00082-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1998 Dec;16(20):2026-30. doi: 10.1016/s0264-410x(98)00082-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a total of 10,220 cases, excluding 916 skin cancers other than skin melanoma, averaging 786 cases per year. There were 5086 cancer cases in males with the five most common cancers being: lung cancer (915 cases: 17.9%) followed by bladder cancer (503 cases: 9.8%), larynx (438 cases: 8.6%), lymphoma (393 cases: 7.7%) and leukemia (336 cases: 6.6%). As for female cancer cases, a total of 5134 cases were observed with the five most common cancers being: breast cancer (1821 cases), followed by cervical cancer (535 cases), colo-rectal cancer (256 cases: 4.9%), lymphoma (232 cases: 4.5%), and brain cancer (213 cases: 4.1%). The average age for all cancer cases was 50.5 years with a standard deviation (SD) of 18.8 years. The average age of females (48.8 yrs; SD 17.4) was relatively lower than that of males (52.2 yrs; SD 19.9) and the difference was statistically significant. 40.6% of the patients were under the age of 50 years. 49% of breast cancer patients were below 50 years of age. In children less than 15 years of age, there were 555 cases, with leukemia being the commonest (185 cases: 33.3% of childhood cases) followed by brain cancer (112 cases: 20.1%), lymphoma (63 cases: 11.3%), bone cancer (41 cases: 7.3%), soft tissue sarcoma (35 cases: 6.3%) and kidney cancer (28 cases: 5.0%). Lung cancer in males and breast cancer in females are the most common cancers in Lebanon. These cancers are amenable to prevention (cigarette cessation and anti-smoking campaigns for lung cancer) and early detection (screening, regular breast examination and mammography for breast cancer).

A microbiological study was carried out to determine the percentage of positive blood cultures per episode and the characteristics of bacteremia and to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated strains. Twenty-seven episodes of bacteremia from S. maltophilia were identified in 26 patients, half of whom were women, and the median age was 40 years. A total of 48% of the patients had blood malignancy (12 cases), with acute myeloid leukemia (5 cases) being the most frequent. Seven patients (27%) needed to be admitted to an intensive care unit for some type of vital support and/or intensive treatment. The previous administration of large spectrum antimicrobials (21/26) and the presence of a catheter or central catheter (19/26) were the most frequently found predisposing factors (81% and 73%, respectively). One-quarter of the patients had received treatment with carbapenems. Immunodepression caused by chemotherapy or corticosteroids occurred in 65% of the cases. Half of the patients had undergone a major surgical procedure or had been intubated and submitted to mechanical ventilation. One-third presented granulocytopenia on the detection of bacteremia and 6 of the 12 patients with blood malignancy showed severe neutropenia (<500 neutrophils/mm3). The bacteremia was acquired in hospital in 78% of the cases (21/27). In 26% of these cases, S. maltophilia was diagnosed as the probable cause of bacteremia; in 34% this was just a possibility. The origin of the bacteremia was unknown in 11 cases (40%). Infection from the vascular catheter was the most frequent focus infection (7 cases). An average of 3.6 blood cultures were performed per patient, out of a total of 92, and 54% showed positive. The average time of growth for S. maltophilia in the blood culture bottles was 30 hours. One-third of the bacteremia episodes from S. maltophilia were polymicrobial (9/27). Clinical evolution was favorable in 18 patients, while 8 died (31%), 5 cases (20%) from causes directly related to the bacteremia (4 from septic shock). The mortality associated with the polymicrobial bacteremia was not significantly different from that for single microbial bacteremia from S. maltophilia.

Exposure of the cells to the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 led to a rapid transient rise in egr-1 and c-fos mRNA production followed by an increase in Egr-1 and c-Fos protein levels as well as an increase in Egr-1 and activator protein 1 (AP-1) DNA-binding activity. Preincubation of the cells with KN-62, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, strongly decreased the Ca2+-mediated expression of egr-1 and c-fos. In contrast, treatment with cyclosporin A, which inhibits the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B or calcineurin, increased both egr-1 and c-fos mRNA production and the DNA-binding activity of the Egr-1 and AP-1 transcription factors in response to the intracellular Ca+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)-increasing agents A23187 or cyclopiazonic acid. Enhancement of the Ca2+-induced c-fos and egr-1 expression by cyclosporin A was correlated with the capability of this agent to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity in ELM-I-1 cells. Studies on the phosphorylation state and DNA-binding activity of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) did not demonstrate an early Ca2+-dependent activation of this transcription factor, suggesting that the regulation of c-fos and egr-1 expression by Ca2+ is not linked to CREB in the haematopoietic ELM-I-1 cells. The results indicate that calcineurin exerts negative regulatory effects on both egr-1 and c-fos expression in murine erythroleukaemia cells, in addition to the calcineurin-mediated down-regulation of c-myb expression observed previously in this cell system. This study therefore emphasizes the important role of calcineurin as a negative modulator of gene expression in certain cell types.","['Schaefer, A', 'Magocsi, M', 'Fandrich, A', 'Marquardt, H']","['Schaefer A', 'Magocsi M', 'Fandrich A', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, Hamburg University Medical School and Fraunhofer Department of Toxicology and Environmental Medicine, Grindelallee 117, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany. aschaefe@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, fos', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/31 00:00,1998/10/31 00:01,['1998/10/31 00:00'],"['1998/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3350505 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Nov 1;335 ( Pt 3):505-11. doi: 10.1042/bj3350505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1219809,,,,

Women attended screening rounds between 1974 and 1985, during which blood pressure measurements were taken and information on drug use and smoking was ascertained. Since 1974 (median follow-up time 19 years) information on cause of death has been obtained from the patient's general practitioner. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive drugs. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the association between hypertension (treated and untreated) and total and site-specific mortalities from cancer. The influences of systolic and diastolic blood pressures per 10 mmHg increase for women not using antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. Analyses were adjusted for age, smoking, and body mass index. RESULTS: In total, 704 women died of cancer and 1633 women left the study area. Hypertensive women had a greater than normal (not statistically significant) total risk of mortality from cancer [hazard ratio (HR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.31]. Risks for treated and untreated hypertensive women were similar. Cancer-site-specific analyses revealed a statistically significantly lower mortality from gastrointestinal cancers among untreated hypertensive women (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93), whereas mortality from lung cancer was more prevalent among these women (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.37-4.59). Mortality from lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers for drug-treated hypertensive women was greater than normal (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.04-4.28), as was mortality from cancers of the uterus, cervix, and ovary (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.00-3.26). CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that, if there is a link between blood pressure and cancer, it is likely to be positive and relatively small (+10%); and applies also to nondrug-treated women. The relation may apply for some types of cancer, but not for others.","['Peeters, P H', 'van Noord, P A', 'Hoes, A W', 'Grobbee, D E']","['Peeters PH', 'van Noord PA', 'Hoes AW', 'Grobbee DE']","['Julius Center for Patient-Oriented Research, Utrecht University, Medical School, Medical Hospital, The Netherlands.

Chromosome translocations: dangerous liaisons.,244-50,"Many chromosome abnormalities, especially translocations or inversions, are closely associated with a particular morphologic or phenotypic subtype of leukemia, lymphoma, or sarcoma. Cloning the genes at the breakpoints of these rearrangements has provided critical tools for more-precise diagnosis; in some cases the particular diagnosis has prognostic implications. In addition, many of the genes had not been previously identified; their discovery has had a major impact on our understanding of the molecular biology of cancer. One such gene is MLL (myeloid-lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia), which is located at chromosome band 11q23. This gene is involved in the 4;11 and 11;19 (p13.3) translocations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in the 6;11, 9;11, and 11;19 (p13.1) translocations in acute myeloblastic leukemia. It is also involved in most translocations in infants (under 1 year of age) with acute leukemia and in patients with acute leukemia who were previously treated with drugs that inhibit toposiomerase II. The target gene of MLL is unknown at present, but because of its homology to the trithorax gene in Drosophila, and based on experimental data from mice, it appears to be involved in maintaining the function of some of the homeobox genes. The development of cytogenetic and molecular probes for MLL rearrangements has confirmed that translocations involving MLL are associated with a very poor prognosis. Thus physicians can identify patients with MLL involvement and can institute treatment for these high-risk patients. An increasing understanding of MLL should lead to more-effective targeted therapy.","['Rowley, J D']",['Rowley JD'],"['Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago Medical Center, Illinois 60637-1470, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Lecture', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2143(98)90036-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2143(98)90036-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1998 Oct;132(4):244-50. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2143(98)90036-1.,,['NCI CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In bcl-2 deficient mice, extensive apoptosis occurs during abnormal nephrogenesis, and renal failure is found very quickly after birth. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the degenerative process in the kidneys seen after birth is based either on increased apoptosis of glomerular cells or on mechanisms independent from the genetic defect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kidneys from 7-56-day-old bcl-2 knockout mice and wild-type litter mates were studied. Glomerular number, glomerular tuft volume, cell counts in 'non-sclerotic' glomeruli as well as the glomerular damage score were determined by histomorphometrical studies. Apoptosis was evaluated by morphological criteria and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL)-technique. RESULTS: The number of nephrons at birth was severely decreased in bcl-2 knockout mice compared to controls (<20%; P < 0.001). These nephrons undergo dramatic hypertrophy with an approximately 4-fold increase in volume (P < 0.001). In hypertrophic, but 'non-sclerotic' glomeruli, the number density of glomerular cells progressively declined with time (P<0.001). Starting with day 20, enlarged glomeruli developed sclerosis beginning with a segmental distribution, but quickly progressing to global sclerosis. Apoptosis was neither detected in non-sclerotic glomeruli nor in stages prior to fully established sclerosis. As shown by the glomerular damage score, post-natal degeneration of kidneys from bcl-2 knockout animals proceeded rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 knockout mice exhibit deficient nephrogenesis resulting in severe oligonephronia at birth. Post-partum development of glomerulosclerosis does not seem to be due to augmented apoptosis. The degenerative process appears to be based on a glomerular overload with increased mechanical stress to the filtration barrier, leading via glomerular hypertrophy, podocyte damage and formation of tuft adhesions to glomerulosclerosis.","['Gassler, N', 'Elger, M', 'Inoue, D', 'Kriz, W', 'Amling, M']","['Gassler N', 'Elger M', 'Inoue D', 'Kriz W', 'Amling M']","['Institut fur Anatomie und Zellbiologie I, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/genetics/*pathology', 'Hypertrophy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Kidney Glomerulus/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ndt/13.10.2509 [doi]'],ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1998 Oct;13(10):2509-18. doi: 10.1093/ndt/13.10.2509.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of THP-1 cells with Trap-14 induced rapid rounding of ameboid cells adherent to fibronectin-coated slides, whereas cell rounding was abrogated in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine or the endothelin B receptor antagonist, BQ-788. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in the culture supernatant increased markedly within minutes of Trap-14 exposure with a concomitant loss in cellular ET-1 immunoreactivity. Importantly, loss of ET-1 immunoreactivity was blocked by pretreatment with the vesicle translocation inhibitor, nocodazole. Trap-14 potently induced the release of NO from THP-1 cells, whereas NO release was ablated by preincubation with BQ-788. These data demonstrate that thrombin receptor activation may inhibit cellular spreading as a result of autocrine ET-1 release and subsequent endothelin B receptor-dependent NO production, and suggest that initial exposure of inflammatory cells to thrombin may limit cellular activation and recruitment.","['Srivastava, K D', 'Magazine, H I']","['Srivastava KD', 'Magazine HI']","['Department of Biology, Queens College and Graduate School, City University of New York, Flushing 11367, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Endothelin Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptor, Endothelin B)', '0 (Receptors, Endothelin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '137339-65-2 (thrombin receptor peptide (42-55))', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '44OLL8XEJ4 (BQ 788)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonists', 'Endothelin-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Endothelin B', 'Receptors, Endothelin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombin/drug effects/*physiology', 'Thrombin/pharmacology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Nov 1;161(9):5039-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, alone or in combination, caused a significant up-regulation of the NADPH oxidase system as reflected by an enhancement of the PMA-stimulated superoxide release, cytochrome b558 content, and expression of gp91-phox and p47-phox genes on both days 2 and 7 of cell culture. Noteworthy was the tremendous synergism between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha for all studied parameters. Dexamethasone down-regulated the NADPH oxidase system of cytokine-differentiated THP-1 cells as assessed by an inhibition on the PMA-stimulated superoxide release, cytochrome b558 content, and expression of the gp91-phox and p47-phox genes. The nuclear run-on assays indicated that dexamethasone down-regulated the NADPH oxidase system at least in part by inhibiting the transcription of gp91-phox and p47-phox genes. Indomethacin inhibited only the PMA-stimulated superoxide release of THP-1 cells differentiated with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha during 7 days. None of the other parameters was affected by indomethacin.

Pretreatment with dexamethasone (10 and 100 nM) for 18 h inhibited the Ag-induced increase in JNK activity in a concentration-dependent manner. At least 6 h of preincubation with dexamethasone was necessary to inhibit the Ag-induced JNK activation. The phosphorylation of c-Jun induced by the Ag stimulation was reduced by pretreatment with dexamethasone without reduction of the content of c-Jun protein. The Ag-induced activation of the JNK kinase kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 was also inhibited by pretreatment with dexamethasone at 10 and 100 nM.

In this study, we demonstrate that soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1) exhibits chemotactic activity of T cells with high affinity VLA-4 against VCAM-1, such as Jurkat T cells and IL-2-dependent T cells. Moreover, we found that T cells in the synovial fluid show high basal migration in the absence of sVCAM-1, compared with peripheral blood T cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Among T cells in the synovial fluid, CD45RO+ memory T cells, in response to sVCAM-1, showed a much higher than basal migratory response when compared with CD45RA+ naive cells, while no significant difference was observed between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The chemotactic activity of sVCAM-1 is inhibited in the presence of anti-VCAM-1 and anti-VLA-4, which interfered with the binding between VCAM-1 and VLA-4. Inhibition studies using various kinase inhibitors (C3 exoenzyme, KN62, and H7) show that Rho, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and protein kinase C are involved in signal transduction in sVCAM-1-induced chemotaxis, respectively, whereas tyrosine kinase seems to play a lesser role, since genistein showed only partial inhibition of T cell chemotaxis. Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-serine mAb (MO82) reveals that Ser82 in the vimentin is phosphorylated specifically by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II through sVCAM-1 activation in the IL-2 dependent T cells. Collectively, by inducing migration and recruitment of T cells through several kinase activations, sVCAM-1 contributes to the development of the inflammation of synovial lesion.","['Kitani, A', 'Nakashima, N', 'Izumihara, T', 'Inagaki, M', 'Baoui, X', 'Yu, S', 'Matsuda, T', 'Matsuyama, T']","['Kitani A', 'Nakashima N', 'Izumihara T', 'Inagaki M', 'Baoui X', 'Yu S', 'Matsuda T', 'Matsuyama T']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology/pathology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Clonal Anergy', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrin beta1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Solubility', 'Synovial Fluid/cytology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/pharmacology']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Nov 1;161(9):4931-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN-gamma increased the surface expression of class II molecules in THP-1 cells and this was markedly reduced in cells infected with M. tuberculosis. Despite this effect, steady state levels of HLA-DRalpha, HLA-DRbeta, and invariant (Ii) chains were equivalent in control and infected cells. Metabolic labeling combined with pulse-chase experiments and biochemical analysis showed that the majority of class II molecules in infected cells became resistant to endoglycosidase H, consistent with normal Golgi processing. However, results of intracellular staining and dual color confocal microscopy revealed a significant defect in transport of newly synthesized class II molecules through the endocytic compartment. Thus, compared with findings in control cells, class II molecules in infected cells colocalized to a minimal extent with a lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1+ endosomal compartment. In addition, in contrast to control cells, class II molecules in infected cells failed to colocalize with endocytosed BSA under conditions where this marker is known to label late endosomes, lysosomes, and the MHC class II compartment. Consistent with defective transport along the endocytic pathway, the maturation of SDS-stable class II alphabeta dimers--dependent upon removal of Ii chain and peptide loading of class II dimers in the MHC class II compartment--was markedly impaired in M. tuberculosis-infected cells. These findings indicate that defective transport and processing of class II molecules through the endosomal/lysosomal system is responsible for diminished cell surface expression of MHC class II molecules in cells infected with M. tuberculosis.","['Hmama, Z', 'Gabathuler, R', 'Jefferies, W A', 'de Jong, G', 'Reiner, N E']","['Hmama Z', 'Gabathuler R', 'Jefferies WA', 'de Jong G', 'Reiner NE']","['Department of Medicine, The British Columbia Cancer Agency, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Research Institute of Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (invariant chain)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Biological Transport', 'Dimerization', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Hexosaminidases/pharmacology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/*microbiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tuberculosis/complications/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vacuoles/metabolism']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Nov 1;161(9):4882-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their synergistic interaction leads to a rapid deterioration of the host defense. In vivo, MAC manifests as a disseminated granulomatous disease that produces a massive inflammatory tissue response perhaps through its activation of inflammatory cytokines. The intracellular signaling following interaction of the mycobacterium with host cells is incompletely understood. Because the response is dependent, in part, on the activation of NF-kappaB, we investigated the effect of MAC on this nuclear transcription factor in cells of macrophage and nonmacrophage lineage. We demonstrate that both high and low virulence strains of MAC potently and rapidly activated NF-kappaB. In supershift assays, using specific Abs against the NF-kappaB subunits, we identified a p50/p65 heterodimer that was formed within 5 min after incubation with the bacterium too rapidly for cytokines to be involved in the activation. This activation was instead mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, inasmuch as preincubation of cells with a variety of antioxidants inhibited NF-kappaB activation. Likewise, the transfection of cells with Mn-superoxide dismutase blocked the NF-kappaB activation induced by the bacterium. These data suggest that NF-kappaB activation is a consequence of interaction of host cells with the bacterium and that the interaction may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Giri, D K', 'Mehta, R T', 'Kansal, R G', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Giri DK', 'Mehta RT', 'Kansal RG', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, University of Texas M.

Antigenic stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells led to an increase in newly synthesized TNF-alpha mRNA that was dependent on continuous receptor aggregation and did not require de novo protein synthesis. Kinetic analysis showed that maximal levels were achieved at 60 min and waned by 180 min of stimulation. Concomitant with the transcriptional activation of the TNF-alpha gene, the rapid appearance and disappearance of a previously uncharacterized nuclear NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, comprised of two distinct protein complexes, were observed. These protein complexes bound to NF-kappaB sites within the TNF-alpha gene and contained novel proteins (three species of Mr between 90,000-110,000) distinct from the classical proteins in NF-kappaB complexes. The induced NF-kappaB binding activity required continuous receptor stimulation and induced NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. Consistent with a role for the novel NF-kappaB nuclear binding activity in TNF-alpha gene expression, deletion of several 5' kappaB elements in the TNF-alpha promoter abolished all measurable Fc epsilonRI-dependent induction of a reporter construct. Pharmacologic agents that inhibited the NF-kappaB binding activity also inhibited TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Our results demonstrate that a novel NF-kappaB-like nuclear binding activity plays an important role in regulation of the rapid and transient transcriptional activation of the TNF-alpha gene via Fc epsilonRI.","['Pelletier, C', 'Varin-Blank, N', 'Rivera, J', 'Iannascoli, B', 'Marchand, F', 'David, B', 'Weyer, A', 'Blank, U']","['Pelletier C', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Rivera J', 'Iannascoli B', 'Marchand F', 'David B', 'Weyer A', 'Blank U']","['Unite Immuno-Allergie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'NF-kappa B', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Nov 1;161(9):4768-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, CD38 has been shown to participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways following its ligation with CD38-specific mAbs. In this study we report that ligation of CD38 by one such agonistic mAb (IB4) induced proliferation of cultured leukemic cells in vitro. In HL-60, KG-1A, NB4, and OCI-AML-3 myeloid leukemia cell lines, IB4 mAb induced an increase in the proliferating cell fraction as determined by cell number, clonogenic assay, and flow cytometric analysis. The presence of Ab caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of CFU and an increase in cell divisions. HL-60-Dox cells (a HL-60-doxorubicin-resistant cell line), which have no detectable CD38 expression, failed to respond to IB4 mAb. The effect of CD38 ligation on cell growth was also evaluated in freshly isolated leukemic cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A significant increase in the proliferating cell fraction (S+G2M) was observed in 50% of the patients incubated with IB4 mAb. In five of the six AML patients, anti-CD38 mAb stimulated the proliferation of AML colony-forming cells. These results suggest that ligation of CD38 can induce the proliferation of leukemic cells and may play a role in the propagation of leukemic cell clones in certain cohorts of AML patients.","['Konopleva, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Zhao, S', 'Andreeff, M', 'Mehta, K']","['Konopleva M', 'Estrov Z', 'Zhao S', 'Andreeff M', 'Mehta K']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling pathways, as measured by activation of Janus protein kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, STAT5, and STAT6, in pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl. To determine whether activation of these cytokine signaling pathways by v-Abl is important in the cellular events induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus, the effects of IL-4 and IL-7 on pre-B cells transformed with a temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant were examined. Whereas IL-4 had little or no effect, IL-7 delayed both the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that occur upon v-Abl kinase inactivation. IL-7 also delayed the decreases in the levels of c-Myc, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL that occur upon loss of v-Abl kinase activity. IL-7 did not maintain v-Abl-mediated differentiation arrest of the pre-B cells, as activation of NF-kappaB and RAG gene transcription was unaffected by IL-7.

We show that we have constructed a sublibrary of genomic fragments that contains a significant fraction of the EVI-1-binding sites in the mouse genome. Our data has allowed us to estimate that there are approximately 4300 binding sites per haploid genome in the mouse. We further demonstrate that by using cDNA hybrid selection, it is relatively straightforward to isolate cDNAs that correspond to genes embedded in the EVI-1-binding sublibrary. Several of these are novel, but are represented in databases of anonymous human or mouse cDNAs (expressed sequence tags). One selected gene is Itpr2, encoding the inositol trisphosphate type two receptor, which is transcriptionally regulated during myelopoiesis.

We have used an Lg-MDR1-IRES-neo (LgMIN) retroviral vector, containing MDR1 and neo genes, separated by the EMCV IRES. Human HeLa or canine CTAC cells, transduced with GALV env pseudotyped LgMIN at an MOI of less than 0.01 to ensure 1 proviral copy/genome, were selected with either G418 for neo expression or colchicine for MDR1 expression. The titer determined on HeLa cells with G418 selection was eight-fold higher than that with colchicine selection. In contrast, the same viral supernatant exhibited only a 1.4-fold difference between neo- and MDR1-based viral titer values for CTAC cells. The transduced HeLa cells, with one intact proviral copy per genome, exhibited a 55-fold higher resistance to G418 but only a 4-fold higher resistance to colchicine and a 2-fold higher resistance to Taxol compared with nontransduced cells. About 23% of the transduced cell population did not express vector-derived P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as detected by anti-human P-gp MAb MRK-16. This could explain the difference in viral titers obtained on CTAC cells but not that obtained on HeLa cells. The vector-mediated increase in expression of P-gp was about 20-fold higher in CTAC cells as compared with HeLa cells. These results indicated suppression of expression of vector-derived MDR1 in HeLa cells, in contrast with CTAC cells. To investigate further the possible reasons for this difference, genomic DNA was isolated from the G418-resistant individual colonies of infected cells and analyzed by PCR for full-length proviral MDR1. For transduced CTAC and HeLa cells, selected at a G418 concentration of 1 mg/ml, PCR detected aberrant forms of MDR1 in 17 to 25% of colonies tested. The aberrant forms consisted of MDR1 genes with 2- and 0.7-kb deletions. DNA sequencing across the 2-kb and the 0.7-kb deletion junction suggests cryptic splicing in the producer cell line as the origin of these deletions. The 2-kb deletion corresponds to MDR1 mRNA cryptic splicing via donor (codon 113) and acceptor (codon 773). The 0.7-kb deletion corresponds to splicing via the same donor and a different acceptor (codon 344). When transduced HeLa cells were selected at a higher concentration of G418 (3 mg/ml), the aberrant forms were detected at an increased frequency of about 50% of colonies tested. These results indicate that vector-derived MDR1 is a poor selective marker in HeLa cells but not in CTAC cells and that deletions, which inactivated the MDR1 gene in a bicistronic Mo-MuLV vector, may provide an advantage for expression of the second transgene in HeLa cells.","['Zaboikin, M M', 'Schuening, F G']","['Zaboikin MM', 'Schuening FG']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Division, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', '*Transgenes']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.15-2263 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Oct 10;9(15):2263-75. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.15-2263.,,['DK48265/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was achieved by selective elimination of transduced lymphocytes by ganciclovir (GCV) infusion. Despite the positive results of the pilot clinical trial, two vector-related limitations were observed. The induction of a strong immune response against genetically modified cells was observed in two patients. In addition, the only patient who developed chronic GvHD showed only partial response to ganciclovir treatment. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we developed a new generation of vectors. The neomycin resistance (neoR) gene was removed from the SFCMM-3 and SFCMM-4 retroviral vectors. These vectors are less immunogenic and able to confer higher ganciclovir sensitivity to transduced human lymphocytes. All the vectors carry a modified form of the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor cDNA, as cell surface selectable marker (deltaLNGFR). The vectors were compared in terms of gene transfer efficiency, and ability to confer high and specific sensitivity to ganciclovir. The SFCMM-3 vector, carrying the entire HSV-tk gene driven by the LTR promoter, allows efficient transduction of human T lymphocytes and confers the highest GCV sensitivity to transduced lymphocytes with a high and a low proliferation index. The expression of the deltaLNGFR marker allows an easier in vitro manipulation and a faster immune selection of transduced cells compared with neoR selection. Finally, the elimination of the neoR gene removes a potent immunogen from transduced lymphocytes.","['Verzeletti, S', 'Bonini, C', 'Marktel, S', 'Nobili, N', 'Ciceri, F', 'Traversari, C', 'Bordignon, C']","['Verzeletti S', 'Bonini C', 'Marktel S', 'Nobili N', 'Ciceri F', 'Traversari C', 'Bordignon C']","['Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Istituto Scientifico H.S.

The aim of this study was to clarify these lesions using endoscopy. Colonoscopy was performed on 11 of 341 patients with leukaemia and on 32 of 105 patients with malignant lymphoma for frequent diarrhoea, anal bleeding or abnormal findings on barium enema examination, between April 1984 and September 1994. In eight of the 11 patients with leukaemia on whom endoscopy was performed, nine lesions were found; aphthoid ulcers, small ulcers or large tumours due to leukaemic infiltration were found in five, and colorectal adenoma was found in only one patient. Antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis or pseudomembranous colitis was found in one patient each. In 10 of the 32 patients with malignant lymphoma, 11 lesions were found. The following were found in one patient each: large lymphomatous tumours, a large lymphomatous ulcer, multiple small polypoid lesions, multiple lymphomatous polyposis; and colorectal cancer or adenoma in six patients. However, the autopsy findings in patients with both diseases were mostly pseudomembrane formation or ulcers due to fungal and/or bacterial infection. It is concluded that accurate endoscopic diagnosis of lower intestinal lesions in patients with leukaemia or malignant lymphoma is essential for staging and treatment of these diseases and for determining their prognosis. Most lesions in leukaemia are aphthoid and small ulcers are due to leukaemic infiltration or antibiotics; most lesions in malignant lymphoma are elevated lesions such as cancer, adenoma or lymphomatous lesions as determined by endoscopy. This is in contrast to pseudomembrane formation or ulcers due to fungal and/or bacterial infection which are detected at autopsy.","['Kishida, T', 'Hoshino, T', 'Li, F', 'Tanaka, S', 'Shinozawa, I', 'Shibata, Y', 'Tatsuguchi, A', 'Sato, J', 'Fujimori, S', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Kobayashi, M']","['Kishida T', 'Hoshino T', 'Li F', 'Tanaka S', 'Shinozawa I', 'Shibata Y', 'Tatsuguchi A', 'Sato J', 'Fujimori S', 'Yoshida Y', 'Kobayashi M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Diseases/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ulcer/*pathology']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1746.1998.tb00769.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1998 Sep;13(9):961-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1746.1998.tb00769.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort mortality study among 5,185 shoe manufacturing workers employed between 1940 and 1976, and followed from 1979 through 1993. Exposure to CP was assessed by linking the job history with industrial hygiene data. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) using the Moscow population as reference, and conducted an internal comparison analysis based on Poisson regression modeling. RESULTS: For the entire cohort, all-cause mortality was close to expectation and all-cancer mortality was increased. There was an increase in the mortality from liver cancer (SMR = 2.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-4.3), kidney cancer (SMR = 1.8, CI = 0.9-3.4), and leukemia (SMR = 1.9, CI = 1.0-3.3). Mortality from liver cancer and leukemia was associated with various indicators of CP exposure. A similar, although less consistent, pattern was found for kidney cancer mortality; while for the remaining neoplasms, no association was suggested with CP exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The association between CP exposure and risk of leukemia may be due to concomitant exposure to benzene. The results for liver cancer point towards a carcinogenic effect of CP.","['Bulbulyan, M A', 'Changuina, O V', 'Zaridze, D G', 'Astashevsky, S V', 'Colin, D', 'Boffetta, P']","['Bulbulyan MA', 'Changuina OV', 'Zaridze DG', 'Astashevsky SV', 'Colin D', 'Boffetta P']","['Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, Institute of Carcinogenesis, RAMS Cancer Research Centre, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['126-99-8 (Chloroprene)'],IM,"['*Cause of Death', 'Chloroprene/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Moscow/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008863516506 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1998 Aug;9(4):381-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1008863516506.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More unexpectedly it was found that experimental adjuvant arthritis (AA) and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) could be cured by means of total body irradiation (TBI) followed by autologous hemolymphopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. It was postulated that the newly developing T cells might be tolerant to self antigens. The transfer of AID from affected donors to recipients of allogeneic HSC transplants has been reported for many organ-specific AID, including diabetes (IDDM), thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis and thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP); rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were not transferred. Conversely patients with the combination of AID and a severe blood disease (leukemia, aplasia) were cured of both diseases following allogeneic BMT, with the notable exception of a relapse in a patient with RA despite full donor engraftment. Allogeneic transplants are certainly more promising as far as concerns a resolution of AID, because they may also exert a graft-versus-autoimmunity effect by gradually eradicating the recipient's lymphopoiesis, but transplant related mortality (TRM) is considered still too high to employ this procedure consistently. New non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, designed to allow the donor's immune system to take over, are already utilized for malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases, and may become an attractive option for severe, refractory AID. For the time being, however, autologous procedures are still safer, and are being utilized in many projects worldwide. The EBMT/EULAR Registry has collected over 70 patient reports. The more numerous and favorable results have been obtained up to now in multiple scleosis and in systemic lupus erythematosus; the worst in refractory autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. No definite conclusions as to the efficacy of autologous HSC transplantation, from marrow or from blood, with or without T-cell depletion, may be drawn at this time, but the feeling is that real cures will be very difficult to obtain by this approach, and that corticosteroid-free remissions and a general lowering of the autoimmune potential will be more realistic goals. Accurate comparisons with already existing aggressive immunosuppressive protocols will become necessary, if possible by means of prospective randomized clinical studies.","['Marmont, A M']",['Marmont AM'],"[""II Division of Hematology, S.

However, management of the few relapses remains undefined. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the different behavior of APL patients relapsed after induction chemotherapy which had or had not included ATRA. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 8 patients (3 male and 5 female) who had relapsed after a clinical and molecular complete remission (CR). Five patients relapsed after conventional chemotherapy including anthracyclines, without ATRA which was not available at the onset (group A), 3 relapsed after induction treatment according to AIDA protocol (Idarubicin + ATRA) (group B). Seven patients had both molecular and clinical relapses, 1 (group B) had only a molecular relapse. The median first CR duration was 33 months (range 8-63). To induce a second CR all patients were treated with ATRA 45 mg/m2/day given orally until CR, combined with mitoxantrone 6 mg/m2/day for 6 days and cytarabine 1 g/m2/day for 6 days. RESULTS: Seven out of 8 patients (87.5%) achieved second CR, 1 (group A) did not respond and died within two months. Second CR duration was 21, 43+, 56+, 62+ months in group A and 5, 10, 12+ (with molecular relapse) months in group B. Therefore, only one patient relapsed in group A, while all the group B patients relapsed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: ATRA combined with chemotherapy is an effective approach to treating APL relapse. It produces a high incidence of second CR with an acceptable toxicity. The duration of the second CR seems, however, to be longer in patients never treated with ATRA before than in patients who relapsed after the AIDA protocol. Therefore, it might be appropriate to adopt more aggressive protocols in this latter subset of patients.","['Castagnola, C', 'Lunghi, M', 'Corso, A', 'Tajana, M', 'Zappasodi, P', 'Dabusti, M', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Castagnola C', 'Lunghi M', 'Corso A', 'Tajana M', 'Zappasodi P', 'Dabusti M', 'Lazzarino M', 'Bernasconi C']","['Divisione di Ematologia, IRCCS Policlinico S.Matteo di Pavia, Italy. castagnola@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Aug;83(8):714-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, frequent losses in 6q, 11q and/or 13q were observed in CLL using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). We performed CGH analyses in order to find out whether these two entities contain the same DNA copy number changes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with stage IV disease and one with stage III disease were studied by CGH. CGH is based on quantitation of the fluorescence intensity of differentially labeled DNAs. For this purpose tumor DNA labeled with FITC-12dUTP and normal DNA labeled with Texas red-5dUTP were hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes. The ratio of fluorescence intensity of hybridized tumor and normal DNA was measured using computerized image microscopy to identify over- or under-represented regions in the tumor genome. All findings were confirmed using a confidence interval of 99% with a 1% error probability. RESULTS: The most consistent finding was a gain of the entire chromosome 12 observed in three patients and a loss in 14q24 in one patient. No other changes were detected. All abnormal cases presented with stage IV disease and had bone marrow infiltration. Two 12+ cases had a leukemic disease. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trisomy 12 is one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations in SLL. Losses regarded as typical of CLL were not present in SLL. This may indicate that the genetic pathways in the development of SLL/CLL in patients presenting with enlarged lymph nodes (SLL) with or without leukemia are different from those in patients presenting with leukemia (CLL) without enlarged lymph nodes.","['Autio, K', 'Aalto, Y', 'Franssila, K', 'Elonen, E', 'Joensuu, H', 'Knuutila, S']","['Autio K', 'Aalto Y', 'Franssila K', 'Elonen E', 'Joensuu H', 'Knuutila S']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Trisomy']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Aug;83(8):690-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The data obtained showed that the percentage of SE positive cells was higher in MLC compared to negative control MLC. The highest percentage of positive cells was found in the MLC obtained from unrelated subjects.

In some cases the correct diagnosis cannot be confidently made on the basis of clinical setting, routine light microscopy, and immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy may be supportive or definitive in establishing cell type. The cell type is often important in choosing optimal therapy and in predicting prognosis. The authors performed electron microscopy on a moderate number of ovarian small cell tumors and here describe and illustrate the diagnostic features of representative examples of various types. The ultrastructural features of the metastatic tumors, such as embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and melanoma, are identical to those of their respective primary tumors, are well known, and usually pose no problem in diagnosis. On the other hand, the ultrastructural features of some primary ovarian small cell tumors may present a more difficult differential diagnosis, because they have features that are subtle and/or in common. Exemplary of tumors in this category are diffuse adult granulosa cell tumor, endometrial stromal sarcoma, and small cell carcinomas of the hypercalcemic and pulmonary (oat cell) types. Distinguishing among them may be difficult but is possible, and electron microscopy may be a valuable supplement to the diagnostic information obtained from the clinical presentation, light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and, in some tumors, cytometric analysis of these neoplasms.","['Dickersin, G R', 'Scully, R E']","['Dickersin GR', 'Scully RE']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/ultrastructure', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/ultrastructure', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Granulosa Cell Tumor/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/ultrastructure', 'Melanoma/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neuroblastoma/ultrastructure', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/ultrastructure', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*ultrastructure', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/ultrastructure', 'Sarcoma, Endometrial Stromal/ultrastructure', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/ultrastructure']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/01913129809033472 [doi]'],ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 1998 May-Jun;22(3):199-226. doi: 10.3109/01913129809033472.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-resistance of these ADM-resistant cells was examined for a resistance to the number of drugs including colchicine, actinomycin D and ethidium bromide. MDR 1 gene amplification in B3 and C9 subclones was detected using Southern-hybridization with specific probe. Additional genetical material was found in genomes of resistant cells by analysis of G-banded metaphase chromosomes. An extraordinarily long marker chromosome was observed in every C9 metaphase plate. The character of this chromosome G-banding suggests that it may be a derivative of chromosome 5 containing a large homogeneously staining region (HSR) in locus 5q15. Both B2 and B3 subclones expressed double minute chromosomes (DMs) in 5% of cells. In the course of a prolonged cultivation (about 2 years) of C9 cells in the presence of ADM a progressive karyotype destabilization was observed: the frequency of new markers formation in C9 cells increased, cells having additional copies of marker chromosome with HSR appeared, the length of HSR varied, coexistence of HSR and DMs being found in several C9 cells. These karyotypical changes may be regarded as patterns of genome destabilization due to the multidrug resistance of K562/ADM cells.","['Grinchuk, T M', 'Pavlenko, M A', 'Lipskaia, L A', 'Sorokina, E A', 'Tarunina, M V', 'Berezkina, E V', 'Kovaleva, Z V', 'Ignatova, T N']","['Grinchuk TM', 'Pavlenko MA', 'Lipskaia LA', 'Sorokina EA', 'Tarunina MV', 'Berezkina EV', 'Kovaleva ZV', 'Ignatova TN']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, MDR', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Karyotyping']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 1998;40(7):652-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,Ustoichivost' kletok khronicheskogo promieloleikoza cheloveka linii K562 k adriamitsinu korreliruet s napravlennoi destabilizatsiei genoma--amplifikatsiei gena MDR1 i ne sluchainymi izmeneniiami v strukture genotipa.,,,,,,,

Immediate recognition of this complication and initiation of appropriate treatment is crucial in order to control the infection, decrease the morbidity and mortality, and avoid delays in treatment of the underlying condition. The definitive diagnosis requires either positive blood cultures for yeasts in the presence of abnormal findings on imaging studies consistent with HSC, or liver biopsy demonstrating yeast forms or pseudohyphae. We describe our experience in the evaluation of 15 patients with HSC using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic and follow-up tool. The diagnosis of HSC was established by liver biopsy in 11 patients (73%), and by positive blood cultures for Candida in 4 patients (27%). All patients had MRI findings consistent with HSC during the study period. Amphotericin B was administered intravenously to all 15 patients (median duration of treatment, 62 days). Repeat MR images were obtained at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and then at monthly intervals until the resolution of abnormalities. The median time for the disappearance of MRI lesions was 9 weeks. Alterations in the appearance of lesions on MRI were noted throughout chemotherapy in all the 13 (86.6%) responding patients.

Fifteen patients with hemato-oncological malignancies (malignant lymphoma 8, multiple myeloma 3, solid tumor 2, leukemia 2) were enrolled in the study. Continuous high-dose IL-2 infusion was shown to be safely administered, starting as soon as recovery of white blood cell count. All patients developed rebound lymphocytosis 24-48 h after termination of IL-2 infusion. Although grade IV toxicity was observed in 5 patients (7 episodes), all side effects completely subsided. Triple chemotherapy (CTX, etoposide and Ara-C) seemed rather toxic (in this group of heavily treated patients) while CTX alone was well tolerated. Four out of 13 (31%) evaluable patients had partial response and another patient (7%) had stabilization of disease progression lasting 2-8 months.

LIF is a glycoprotein containing six putative N-glycosylation sites. We established Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines to evaluate the biological roles of the N-glycosylation in rat LIF (rLIF). The bioactivity of rLIF was evaluated in two different bioassay systems using F9 and DA-1a cells. Employing site directed mutagenesis, six N-glycosylation-deficient LIF mutants were generated by replacing each asparagine residue (N) (at positions N9, N34, N63, N73, N96, and N116) by glutamine (Q). The resultant mutants showed similar activity in the bioassay using F9 cells. However, N34Q was about 3 times more potent than the wild-type rLIF in the assay using DA-1a cells. These findings suggest that the presence of N-glycan at N34 suppresses cell proliferation. In contrast, N63Q was about 2.5 times less potent than the wild-type rLIF indicating the pivotal role of N63 glycosylation for rLIF bioactivity. Taken together, our data suggest that the N-glycans of LIF play different roles depending on the cell line and that glycosylation of each specific residue contributes differently to its bioactivity.","['Sasai, K', 'Aikawa, J i', 'Saburi, S', 'Tojo, H', 'Tanaka, S', 'Ogawa, T', 'Shiota, K']","['Sasai K', 'Aikawa Ji', 'Saburi S', 'Tojo H', 'Tanaka S', 'Ogawa T', 'Shiota K']","['Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry RIKEN (the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research), Wako-shi, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Primers', 'Glycosylation', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",1998/10/30 00:00,1998/10/30 00:01,['1998/10/30 00:00'],"['1998/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1998 Nov;124(5):999-1003. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the binding to beta- or gamma-catenin, it is unknown, however, which interaction is critical for the function of cadherins. By expressing a series of E-cadherin-alpha-catenin chimeric molecules on leukemia cells (K562), we have identified the region of alpha-catenin that confers aggregation inducing activity to nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin. The region has been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal 295 amino acids of alpha-catenin.

DESIGN: Clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological evaluation of 37 speciated bacillary angiomatosis cases in the literature, including the seven patients in our study. METHODS: Pathological examination of tissue samples, including Warthin-Starry staining and immunohistology; titre of antibodies to Bartonella sp.; detection of Bartonella sp. in blood and biopsy materials by culture or PCR; and statistical analysis of clinical and epidemiological features associated with B. quintana or B. henselae bacillary angiomatosis cases. RESULTS: Seven immunocompromised patients (six with AIDS and one patient with acute leukaemia) had bacillary angiomatosis confirmed by histology. B. quintana was cultured in three patients, whereas B. henselae DNA was amplified by PCR in the remaining four patients. Serum from only one patient reacted with Bartonella antigens. Amongst the 14 B. quintana and 23 B. henselae bacillary angiomatosis cases now reported in the literature, lymphadenopathies were significantly more frequent in B. henselae-infected patients, and neurological disorders of the central nervous system in B. quintana-infected patients. Risk factors were contact with cats, and homelessness or poor socioeconomic status in B. henselae and B. quintana bacillary angiomatosis cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis often remains solely based upon histology, culture or PCR-based methods are useful for the detection of Bartonella sp., and allow identification of the species involved, which is necessary to further characterize clinical and epidemiological features associated with B. quintana or B. henselae infections.","['Gasquet, S', 'Maurin, M', 'Brouqui, P', 'Lepidi, H', 'Raoult, D']","['Gasquet S', 'Maurin M', 'Brouqui P', 'Lepidi H', 'Raoult D']","['Unite des Rickettsies, CNRS UPRES A 6020, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Adult', 'Angiomatosis, Bacillary/*diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Bartonella henselae/classification/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Bartonella quintana/classification/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Culture Media', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Female', 'Homosexuality, Male', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Skin/pathology', 'Substance-Related Disorders/complications']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-199814000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 1998 Oct 1;12(14):1793-803. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199814000-00011.,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that serum of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia contained elevated levels of biologically active soluble CD40L (sCD40L). Whether an augmented CD40L pathway exists in patients with other types of B-cell lymphoid malignancies and the source of native sCD40L in these patients is currently unknown. Using a sensitive ELISA assay, soluble CD40L (sCD40L) was detected in the sera of both healthy individuals and patients with haematological malignancies; however, its level was significantly elevated only in patients with B-cell lymphomas (P<0.0001). Several types of malignant B cells coexpressed CD40 and CD40L proteins, and CD40L mRNA was detected in purified resting malignant B cells. The dual expression of CD40 and CD40L in B cells and the presence of native sCD40L in human serum suggest that a direct T-B-cell contact may not be required for CD40L delivery to B cells. This data raises the possibility that an autocrine cytokine loop involving CD40L may contribute to the growth regulation of benign and malignant B cells in vivo.","['Clodi, K', 'Asgary, Z', 'Zhao, S', 'Kliche, K O', 'Cabanillas, F', 'Andreeff, M', 'Younes, A']","['Clodi K', 'Asgary Z', 'Zhao S', 'Kliche KO', 'Cabanillas F', 'Andreeff M', 'Younes A']","['Department of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas M.

Immunoprecipitation of the CD8 antigen from four of these B-CLLs showed identity to the CD8 antigen expressed on T cells with precipitation of CD8alpha bands of molecular weight approximately 34 kD. In view of the known intracellular signalling mechanism of CD8 using the tyrosine kinase p56-lck, we studied p56-lck expression by Western blot and found lack of consistent expression of the CD8 surface antigen, with most lacking p56-lck. Our report indicates that CD8 expression in B-CLL is probably underrecognized but is not a marker of disease progression. The CD8 on the B-CLL surface is immunochemically identical to the antigen on T cells, but is not accompanied by its usual signalling mechanism of p56-lck tyrosine kinase and therefore is unlikely to be a functionally active receptor.","['Mulligan, S P', 'Dao, L P', 'Francis, S E', 'Thomas, M E', 'Gibson, J', 'Cole-Sinclair, M F', 'Wolf, M']","['Mulligan SP', 'Dao LP', 'Francis SE', 'Thomas ME', 'Gibson J', 'Cole-Sinclair MF', 'Wolf M']","['Department of Haematology, Concord Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precipitin Tests']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00928.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Oct;103(1):157-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00928.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the clonogeneic capacities were 2.66 +/- 0.7 (range 1.8-1.6) and 4.0 +/- 1.6 (range 2.2-7.9) CFC per LTC-IC in patients and controls respectively (P = 0.0015). These quantitative and qualitative defects were aggravated by treatment with mafosfamide at a dose of 50 microg/10(7) MNC/ml, where the mean recovery of LTC-IC after in vitro purging was 42%. In nine patients autografted with purged marrow following high-dose radiochemotherapy, no correlation could be detected between the dose of LTC-IC (mean 6742 +/- 7877/kg) and the kinetics of recovery of haemopoiesis. We concluded that, in acute leukaemia patients in complete remission, the presumably normal residual stem cell pool was not only quantitatively diminished but also qualitatively altered in its capacity to give rise to clonogeneic progenitor cells.","['Yao, M', 'Bouchet, S', 'Harnois, C', 'Giarratana, M C', 'Laporte, J P', 'Gorin, N C', 'Lopez, M', 'Douay, L']","['Yao M', 'Bouchet S', 'Harnois C', 'Giarratana MC', 'Laporte JP', 'Gorin NC', 'Lopez M', 'Douay L']","['Centre Claude-Bernard de Recherche sur la Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00967.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Oct;103(1):124-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00967.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A flow cytometric quantitative analysis of expression levels for UPA-R was performed on fresh blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 74), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n = 24), and biphenotypic leukaemia (BAL, n = 3) using two CD87 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) (3B10 and VIM5). Peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) cells from 15 healthy adults served as controls. Using 3B10 McAb, UPA-R was expressed (>99%) by blood monocytes, neutrophils, and BM myelomonocytic precursors in controls, whereas resting T and B lymphocytes, and CD34+ cells were UPA-R negative. We also attempted to clarify whether UPA-R has a role in mediating neutrophil functions. Oriented locomotion induced by different chemotaxins and lysozyme release by granules stimulated with fMLP or PMA were significantly decreased when UPA-R was neutralized by CD87 McAb. In contrast, the anti-UPA-R McAb had no effect on superoxide anion generation of normal neutrophils. Blasts from AML showed a heterogenous pattern of expression for the UPA-R McAbs, with reactivity strictly dependent on FAB subtype. The highest UPA-R expression was seen in the M5 group: all patients tested (n = 20) showed strong positivity for the UPA-R McAb whereas only 12% (3/24) of ALL patients were CD87 positive, and 2/3 of BAL patients showed a dim expression for CD87. The number of receptors expressed by blast cells in 6/74 (8.1%) AML patients was higher than those of normal samples: in addition, since co-expression of UPA-R and CD34 was not found in normal haemopoietic cells, it may be postulated that CD87 can be used alone (when overexpressed) or in combination with CD34 for the detection of minimal residual disease. Results also indicated that patients with UPA-receptors >12 x 10(3) ABC/cell, irrespective of FAB subtype, had a greater tendency for cutaneous and tissue infiltration and a higher frequency of chromosome abnormalities, thus suggesting the concept that cellular UPA-R content positively correlates with the invasive potential of AML cells. The combination of higher UPA-R positivity, abnormalities of chromosome 11, and M5 FAB morphology may identify a peculiar subset of AML, characterized by a more aggressive clinical course.","['Lanza, F', 'Castoldi, G L', 'Castagnari, B', 'Todd, R F 3rd', 'Moretti, S', 'Spisani, S', 'Latorraca, A', 'Focarile, E', 'Roberti, M G', 'Traniello, S']","['Lanza F', 'Castoldi GL', 'Castagnari B', 'Todd RF 3rd', 'Moretti S', 'Spisani S', 'Latorraca A', 'Focarile E', 'Roberti MG', 'Traniello S']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator']",1998/10/29 03:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/10/29 03:03'],"['1998/10/29 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00932.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Oct;103(1):110-23. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00932.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore complete remission rates were higher with idarubicin (62% v 53%; P = 0.002). Among remitters, fewer of the patients allocated to idarubicin relapsed (P = 0.008) but slightly more died in remission, leading to a non-significant benefit (P = 0.07) in disease-free survival. Overall survival in these five trials was significantly better with idarubicin than with daunorubicin (13% v 9% alive at 5 years; P = 0.03). There was a trend (P = 0.006 for remission rate) for the benefit of idarubicin over daunorubicin to decrease with increasing age. There were no significant differences in outcome in the small trial comparing idarubicin versus doxorubicin, or in the large trial comparing idarubicin versus zorubicin.

Six cases with morphologically, cytogenetically and molecularly proven APL were analysed at diagnosis or relapse by combining fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with standard May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) staining at the single cell level on bone marrow and blood smears. With the FICTION technique, combining immunophenotyping with FISH, haemopoietic precursor cells were identified using monoclonal antibodies against CD34, B- and T-lymphocytes could be identified with CD19 and CD3. In addition, HLA-DR-positive cells were studied for the presence of t(15;17). Morphologically identified myeloblasts were relocated on the smear after FISH and were found to be PML/RARA positive in 91%, abnormal promyelocytes in 97%. In contrast, a positive signal was obtained in only 18% of PMN. Erythroblasts, lymphocytes and plasma cells did not show a PML/RARA rearrangement. Accordingly, all cells expressing CD3 or CD19 were PML/RARA negative. CD34 positive precursor cells identified by FICTION were PML/RARA positive in 97%. HLA-DR-positive cells contained a PML/RARA rearrangement in 24% of cells in one case and were negative in the two other cases investigated. These data indicate that APL appears to originate from a level of haemopoietic precursor cells but is restricted to the myeloid lineage. The low proportion of PML/RARA-positive PMN points to the impairment of blast cell differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage but also emphasizes the existence of normal residual haemopoietic stem cells from which PML/RARA-negative PMN must be derived.","['Haferlach, T', 'Loffler, H', 'Nickenig, C', 'Ramm-Petersen, L', 'Meeder, M', 'Schoch, R', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Schnittger, S', 'Schoch, C', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Haferlach T', 'Loffler H', 'Nickenig C', 'Ramm-Petersen L', 'Meeder M', 'Schoch R', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Schnittger S', 'Schoch C', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Azure Stains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Azure Stains', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00959.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Oct;103(1):93-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00959.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding the effects of such combined treatment on the proliferative capabilities of HL-60 and PLB-985 cell lines, we showed that their growth kinetics were similar after 2 Gy gamma-irradiation combined with ATRA. However, with doses >2 Gy, the behaviour of the cell lines differed largely. Indeed, HL-60 appeared to be more radiosensitive than PLB-985 regarding cell viability and proliferation. Besides, whatever dose of irradiation (2, 5 or 10 Gy) was applied, ATRA was still able to induce differentiation of HL-60 and PLB-985 into granulocytes that retained the capacity to produce superoxide anion. The results of these in vitro studies suggest that leukaemia cell lines retain their ability to respond to ATRA, a granulocytic-differentiating inducer following high doses of irradiation.

MRD was quantified by leukaemia-specific primers in 22 pairs. There was a linear relationship between the logarithms of MRD levels of aspirate and trephine, with a residual variance which increased as the level of MRD fell. The mean level of MRD in the trephines was 4.1-fold greater than that in the aspirates, probably due to greater dilution of the aspirates with peripheral blood. The high variance at low levels of MRD could not be explained by measurement variation, which had an MRD-independent value of 0.42 log10 units, and was attributed to sampling variation due to patchiness of disease at low MRD levels. The magnitude of the variation was such that predictions of outcome could well be confounded for many patients.

The idea that paternal gonadal irradiation might explain the Seascale cluster of childhood leukaemia has been disproved. Fetal irradiation may lead to a reduction in IQ and an increase in seizures in childhood proportional to dose. Estimates that doses to a whole population cause a risk of cancer proportional to dose, with 0.1 Sv given acutely causing a risk of 1%, will need to be modified as more information is obtained, but the idea that there is a threshold for risk above this level is not supported by observations on the irradiated fetus or the effect of fallout. The idea, based on ecological observations, that small doses protect against the development of cancer is refuted by the effect of radon in houses.

Nine of 29 (31%) bacteremic episodes evaluated were polyclonal. The source of bacteremia was not significantly different among patients with polyclonal and monoclonal bacteremic episodes. Patients with polyclonal bacteremic episodes were younger and were more likely to have rapidly fatal diseases than were those with monoclonal bacteremic episodes; however, neither of these differences reached statistical significance. Patients with polyclonal bacteremic episodes were significantly more likely to have leukemia than were those with monoclonal bacteremic episodes (odds ratio = 18.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 to 255.80). Three of nine patients who had polyclonal bacteremia died compared with 2 of 19 patients who had monoclonal bacteremia (odds ratio = 4.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.41 to 50.80). Polyclonal Gram-negative bacteremia is more common than previously thought. Despite their younger age, patients with polyclonal bacteremic episodes were more likely to die than those with monoclonal bacteremic episodes.

For this purpose, a qualitative research method was used because this method enables a description of what it is like to live through childhood cancer in all its aspects. Parents whose child survived cancer were interviewed in depth about the late consequences of the disease. To maximize contrast in parental experience and in coping with the disease, variational sampling was used. Results indicated that parents experienced changes of a definitive and long-lasting nature as a result of cancer in their child. In spite of the child's survival, feelings of loss and perseveration of problems prevailed. To cope with late sequelae, characteristic strategies were identified including the position parents adopt a life or death perspective on the final outcome of the disease, the extent to which they express emotions, and the use of family planning and parenting behavior. Coping strategies used had not only an effect on the individual parent but also on the other family members. Parents who used coping strategies in a non-extreme way appeared to be functioning well.

In THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, RA markedly induced PPARgamma1 RNA, nuclear PPARgamma1 protein and suppressed cell growth. The PPARgamma ligand, BRL49653 enhanced RA's growth suppression ability. With BRL49653 alone, THP-1 cell growth was only marginally suppressed. Cell cycle analysis revealed the G1 phase cell population was significantly increased when cells were treated with both ligands. RA induced growth suppression did not differentiate the THP-1 cells to macrophages. Phorbol ester (PMA) induced differentiation of cells to macrophage also induced PPARgamma1 expression, however when RA is given either simultaneously or sequentially to these cells, no further increase in expression of the nuclear receptor was observed. Overall, these data suggest RA induction of PPARgamma1 may block cell growth and may have application for the treatment of proliferative diseases.","['Zhu, L', 'Gong, B', 'Bisgaier, C L', 'Aviram, M', 'Newton, R S']","['Zhu L', 'Gong B', 'Bisgaier CL', 'Aviram M', 'Newton RS']","['Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Division of Warner-Lambert Company, 2800 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48105, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)99567-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.9567 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 Oct 29;251(3):842-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.9567.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

MTGR2 maps to 16q24 and, like MTG8 and MTGR1, is close to one of three loci encoding a syntrophin (dystrophin-associated proteins). Moreover, an alternative MTGR1 promoter/5' exon is contained within the alpha1-syntrophin locus. Thus, the two classes of genes may define novel paralogous groups. MTGR1 is expressed mainly in brain, while MTGR2 is expressed in the thymus and possibly in monocytes. Like MTG8, MTGR1 is transcribed into a number of isoforms due to alternative splicing of different 5' exons onto a common splice acceptor site. Comparison of the three predicted human MTG8-related polypeptides to their Drosophila counterpart (nervy) highlights four separate regions of sequence conservation that may correspond to distinct domains. The most NH2-terminal of these is proportionately more conserved among the human polypeptides, presumably due to specific structural/functional constraints.","['Calabi, F', 'Cilli, V']","['Calabi F', 'Cilli V']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Division, Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom. fcalabi@ich.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (CBFA2T2 myeloid-transforming gene-related protein)', '0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/10/29 00:00,1998/10/29 00:01,['1998/10/29 00:00'],"['1998/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(98)95429-5 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1998.5429 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1998 Sep 15;52(3):332-41. doi: 10.1006/geno.1998.5429.,"['GENBANK/AF052210', 'GENBANK/AF052211', 'GENBANK/AF052212', 'GENBANK/AF052213', 'GENBANK/AF052214', 'GENBANK/AF052215', 'GENBANK/AF052216', 'GENBANK/AF052217', 'GENBANK/AF052218', 'GENBANK/AF052219', 'GENBANK/AF052220']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

A challenge that remains is to better understand the behavior of these techniques in effort to know when they will be effective tools. Theoretically they may overcome limitations of the traditional multivariable survival technique, the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Experiments were designed to test whether the new tools would, in practice, overcome these limitations. Two datasets in which theory suggests CART and the neural network should outperform the Cox model were selected. The first was a published leukemia dataset manipulated to have a strong interaction that CART should detect. The second was a published cirrhosis dataset with pronounced nonlinear effects that a neural network should fit. Repeated sampling of 50 training and testing subsets was applied to each technique. The concordance index C was calculated as a measure of predictive accuracy by each technique on the testing dataset. In the interaction dataset, CART outperformed Cox (P < 0.05) with a C improvement of 0.1 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.12). In the nonlinear dataset, the neural network outperformed the Cox model (P < 0.05), but by a very slight amount (0.015). As predicted by theory, CART and the neural network were able to overcome limitations of the Cox model. Experiments like these are important to increase our understanding of when one of these new techniques will outperform the standard Cox model. Further research is necessary to predict which technique will do best a priori and to assess the magnitude of superiority.","['Kattan, M W', 'Hess, K R', 'Beck, J R']","['Kattan MW', 'Hess KR', 'Beck JR']","['Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.

Steady-state and substrate trapping studies were performed to better understand how the enzyme functions. The catalytic efficiency was dependent on substrate DNA length. A 14-fold increase in KmDNA was observed as the length decreased from 5000 to 100 base pairs and kcat decreased by a third. Steady-state analyses were used to identify the order of substrate addition onto the enzyme and the order of product release. Double-reciprocal patterns of velocity versus substrate concentration intersected far from the origin and were nearly parallel. The kinetic mechanism does not appear to change when the DNA substrate is either 6250 or 100 base pairs in length. Isotope trapping studies showed that the initial enzyme-AdoMet complex was not catalytically competent; however, the initial enzyme-poly(dI.dC-dI.dC) complex was observed to be competent for catalysis. Product inhibition studies also support a sequential ordered bi-bi kinetic mechanism in which DNA binds to the enzyme first, followed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine, and then the products S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and methylated DNA are released. The proposed mechanism is similar to the mechanism proposed for M. HhaI, a bacterial DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase. Evidence for an enzyme-DNA-DNA ternary complex is also presented.","['Flynn, J', 'Reich, N']","['Flynn J', 'Reich N']","['Department of Chemistry, Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara 93106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '25853-45-6 (poly d(I-C))', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Catalysis', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'DNA Methylation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/chemistry', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi9810609 [doi]', 'bi9810609 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Oct 27;37(43):15162-9. doi: 10.1021/bi9810609.,,['GM 56289/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to elucidate the molecular events of la-Ph and subsequent translocations of la-Ph leukemia, we performed molecular analysis on the complex rearrangements, in a cell line, MY, which was established from bone marrow mononuclear cells of a patient with a la-Ph acute biphenotypic leukemia. This la-Ph, expressing an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type BCR/ABL transcript, produces a novel P180BCR/ABL fusion protein reflecting deletion of 174 bases (58 amino acids) encoded by the a2 exon of the ABL gene. An immune complex kinase assay showed that this protein had autophosphorylation activity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in conjunction with G-banding analysis revealed that the initial der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11) progressed to a der(9)(9pter-->9q34::22q11-->22q13::5q11.2 -->5q15:: 10q23-->10qter) by, first, a three-way translocation among the der(9)t(9;22)(q34;q11), chromosome 5, and the normal chromosome 22, and then a subsequent translocation with chromosome 10. Moreover, both the end-stage leukemic cells of the patient and the MY cell line had another translocation, t(X;12)(p11.2;p13). The 12p breakpoint was located near the ETV6 gene by analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, but transcription of ETV6 was unaffected. Tumorigenicity analysis indicated that an additional translocation, t(2;3)(p16;q29), may have caused a more malignant clone, because only MY cells with the t(2;3)(p16;q29) were capable of growing subcutaneously in nude mice within 40 days. The molecular events of leukemogenesis and leukemic progression in the present la-Ph AL occurred by accumulation of unique translocations. This cell line, MY, expressing a novel variant P180BCR/ABL protein with a deletion of the a2 exon of the ABL gene, may be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of this fusion protein and for studying ETV6-related leukemogenesis and t(2;3), as well as the molecular mechanisms of the complex translocations.","['Inokuchi, K', 'Shinohara, T', 'Futaki, M', 'Hanawa, H', 'Tanosaki, S', 'Yamaguchi, H', 'Nomura, T', 'Dan, K']","['Inokuchi K', 'Shinohara T', 'Futaki M', 'Hanawa H', 'Tanosaki S', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Nomura T', 'Dan K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/28 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/28 03:03'],"['1998/10/28 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/28 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199811)23:3<227::AID-GCC4>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199811)23:3<227::aid-gcc4>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Nov;23(3):227-38. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199811)23:3<227::aid-gcc4>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins is regulated by divalent cations and, as demonstrated more recently, by mitogenic cytokines which activate them by ""inside-out"" mechanisms. Using the adhesive interaction of a cytokine-dependent human hemopoietic cell line to immobilized fibronectin, we have analyzed the requirements in divalent cations Mn2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ for alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 activation by ""inside-out"" mechanisms triggered by cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or KIT ligand, or by external conformational constraints with the function-activating anti-beta 1 integrin monoclonal antibody 8A2. The intrinsic difference between these two modes of beta 1 integrin activation was revealed by their different requirements in divalent cations. We found that in the absence of any divalent cations, alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 were non-functional even after further stimulation by cytokines or 8A2. However, whilst either Ca2+, Mg2+ or Mn2+ were able to restore adhesive functions of alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 when activated by 8A2, only Mg2+ and Mn2+ were able to support activation of alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 by cytokines. Furthermore, high concentrations of Ca2+ exceeding 20 mM dramatically inhibited cell adhesion to fibronectin induced by Mn2+ and cytokines but not by 8A2. On the contrary, in the presence of both Ca2+ and Mg2+, Mn2+ had an additive effect on the activation of alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 by mitogenic cytokines. The presence of the absence of these divalent cations did not inhibit early tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the binding of KIT ligand to its tyrosine-kinase receptor KIT. Therefore, we propose that in hemopoietic cells, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+ may modulate in vivo alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 regulation by mitogenic cytokines, a phenomenon involved in the regulation of hemopoietic progenitor cell homing within the bone marrow.","['Takamatsu, Y', 'Simmons, P J', 'Levesque, J P']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Simmons PJ', 'Levesque JP']","['Matthew Roberts Foundation Laboratory, Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cell Adhes Commun,Cell adhesion and communication,9417027,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'M4I0D6VV5M (Calcium Chloride)']",IM,"['Anti-Allergic Agents/immunology/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Calcium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Fibronectins/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/15419069809010781 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Adhes Commun. 1998 Jul;5(5):349-66. doi: 10.3109/15419069809010781.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antitumor activity of BCH-4556 was evaluated using human tumor colony-forming unit (HTCFU) assay, in which fresh tumor specimens were taken directly from patients with and without prior chemotherapy. RESULTS: Overall, in vitro responses (50% or less survival compared to untreated controls) were observed in 11% (two of 18), 29% (five of 17) and 50% (nine of 18) of specimens treated for one hour with BCH-4556 at 1, 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively; and 16% (nine of 55), 32% (24 of 74), 48% (35 of 73) and 65% (11 of 17) of specimens treated continuously with BCH-4556 at 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. With the one-hour schedule, a significant difference in response rates was noted between 100 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml (P = 0.02). With the continuous schedule, significant differences in response rates were observed between 1 microgram/ml and 0.1 microgram/ml (P = 0.02), between 10 micrograms/ml and 0.1 microgram/ml (P = 0.0001), as well as between 10 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml (P = 0.01). A trend suggesting the superiority of continuous exposure was observed in paired specimens (n = 18) at comparable drug concentrations. Activity was noted against ovarian (nine of 16 = 56%), renal (three of four = 75%), and melanoma (two of two = 100%) HTCFU at 10 micrograms/ml using the continuous schedule. Comparisons between BCH-4556 and paclitaxel were made in 32 specimens at 10 micrograms/ml using the continuous exposure. Twenty-three specimens showed similar responses with both drugs; seven showed better responses with BCH-4556; and two showed better responses with paclitaxel (P = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Promising activity was observed with BCH-4556 against ovarian, renal, and melanoma HTCFU. There appeared to be a positive relationship between BCH-4556 concentration and response using both one-hour and continuous exposures. Continuous exposure to BCH-4556 provided high response rates especially at concentrations above 10 micrograms/ml. For both one-hour and continuous exposures, BCH-4556 had similar, and at times, greater potency than paclitaxel against the same tumor specimens in the present study.","['Siu, L L', 'Attardo, G', 'Izbicka, E', 'Lawrence, R', 'Cerna, C', 'Gomez, L', 'Davidson, K', 'Finkle, C', 'Marsolais, C', 'Rowinsky, E K', 'Von Hoff, D D']","['Siu LL', 'Attardo G', 'Izbicka E', 'Lawrence R', 'Cerna C', 'Gomez L', 'Davidson K', 'Finkle C', 'Marsolais C', 'Rowinsky EK', 'Von Hoff DD']","['Institute for Drug Development, Cancer Therapy and Research Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dioxolanes/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008387019062 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55963-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 Aug;9(8):885-91. doi: 10.1023/a:1008387019062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classification.",849-55,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) account for about 10% of all lymphomas in Western countries. The aim of the present study is to analyze the initial characteristics and prognostic factors in a large series of PTCL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 174 patients (105 male/69 female; median age 61 years) were diagnosed with PTCL according to the R.E.A.L. Classification in nine Spanish institutions between 1985 and 1996. Cutaneous lymphomas and T-cell chronic lymphocytic/prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of the main initial variables. RESULTS: The distribution according to histology subgroup was: PTCL unspecified, 95 cases (54.4%); anaplastic large-cell Ki-l-positive (ALCL), 30 cases (17%); angioimmunoblastic T cell, 22 cases (13%); angiocentric, 14 cases (8%); intestinal T cell, 12 cases (7%), and hepatosplenic gamma delta T cell, one case (0.6%). As compared to the other types, ALCL presented more frequently in ambulatory performance status, without extranodal involvement, in early stage, normal serum beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) level and low-risk international prognostic index (IPI). Most patients were treated with adriamycin-containing regimens. The overall CR rate was 49% (69% for ALCL vs. 45% for other PTCL; P < 0.02). The risk of relapse was 48% at four years. Median survival of the series was 22 months (65 months for ALCL vs. 20 months for other PTCL; P = 0.03), with a four-year probability of survival of 38% (95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 28-48). In the univariate analysis, in addition to the histology, older age, poor performance status, presence of B-symptoms, extranodal involvement, bone marrow infiltration, advanced Ann Arbor stage, high serum LDH, high serum B2M, and intermediate- or high-risk IPI were related to poor survival. In the multivariate analysis the histologic subgroup (ALCL vs. other PTCL) (P = 0.02; response rate (RR): 4.3), the presence of B-symptoms (P = 0.02, RR: 2.2), and the IPI (low vs. high) (P = 0.04, RR: 2) maintained independent predictive value. When the analysis was restricted to the unspecified subtype, only IPI had independent prognostic value (P = 0.003; RR: 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: PTCL have adverse prognostic features at diagnosis, respond poorly to therapy and have short survival, with no sustained remission. ALCL constitutes a subgroup which responds better to therapy and has a longer survival.","['Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Cid, J', 'Salar, A', 'Lopez, A', 'Montalban, C', 'Castrillo, J M', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Ribera, J M', 'Brunet, S', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Fernandez de Sevilla, A', 'Bosch, F', 'Montserrat, E']","['Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Cid J', 'Salar A', 'Lopez A', 'Montalban C', 'Castrillo JM', 'Gonzalez M', 'Ribera JM', 'Brunet S', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Fernandez de Sevilla A', 'Bosch F', 'Montserrat E']","['Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain. alopezg@medicina.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/classification/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008418727472 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55958-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 Aug;9(8):849-55. doi: 10.1023/a:1008418727472.,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical potential is illustrated by two examples. First, the phenotypes of clonal cells in the bone marrow (BM) of a patient with multiple myeloma (MM), were determined by sorting cells phenotypically defined by their expression of surface antigens and then performing RT-PCR on the individual sorted cells using the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene as clonal marker. All plasma cells with the phenotype CD38++/CD45RA- expressed the clonal marker, whereas it could not be detected in plasma cells with the phenotype CD38++/CD45RA+. A minor population of clonal cells with the CD38+/CD45RA- phenotype was found. Second, the number of committed (CD34+/CD38+) and non-committed (CD34+/CD38-) stem cells, expressing the chimeric fusion gene p210 BCR/ABL in the autograft from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), was determined. The number of cells expressing BCR/ABL mRNA was nearly equal in the CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38- compartment (8.1 and 8.5%).

To obtain a conceptual model for B-CLL, defined as a relentless accumulation of resting B-CLL cells, it is particularly relevant to ask which cell type is the normal counterpart of B-CLL; what is the site of proliferation; which signals are involved in the recruitment and induction of proliferation and which signals contribute to the survival of the B-CLL cells? The significance of the studies on B-CLL cells in vitro for the interpretation of the in vivo situation may be questioned since they oversimplify the multiple and complex cellular interactions that occur in vivo. However, the in vitro studies have been instrumental in elucidating signals that may regulate growth, differentiation and survival of B-CLL cells.

The putative presence of T-cell clonotypes was analyzed with a polymerase chain reaction-based method determining V-D-J junction size patterns in 24 T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta subfamilies. This high-resolution method, analyzing CDR3 sizes of TCR transcripts, was used in conjunction with cytometric analysis of the corresponding T-cell subpopulations with 18 TCR V beta-specific monoclonal antibody. We found multiple dominant T-cell clonotypes in the blood of most patients with B-CLL or myeloma as well of a patient with stage IV NHL. In some cases, T-cell clonal expansion was so dominant that the percentage of these clonal T-cell subpopulations in blood represented more than the mean +2 SD value determined in a series of healthy controls. We conclude that a systemic antigen-specific (i.e., leading to clonotypic expansion) immune reaction involving few TCR clonotypes is a hallmark of disseminated B-cell malignancies.

In fact, patients affected by an inherited immune deficiency, and those presenting disease characterized by autoimmune dysfunctions, show an increased risk for the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Several viruses have been identified as potential aetiologic agents for of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: one of these is the Epstein-Barr virus, which has been detected in cultures of tumour cells from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma: this virus seems to be involved also in the pathogenesis of some histological variants of Hodgkin's disease. In addition, the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus family members have also been recognized as possible aetiologic agents for several lymphomas, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, T-cell leukaemia and T-cell hairy cell leukaemia. Recently, hepatitis C virus has been recognized as the aetiologic agent of mixed cryoglobulinaemia, which can be considered as a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. Since mixed cryoglobulinaemia can frequently evolve into more aggressive haematological disorders, an increased prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas has been found, especially in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

The aim of the present work was to administer poly I:C to irradiated, leukemic mice, both before and after syngeneic bone marrow transplant with the intent of boosting the host's natural immunity in the critical peritransplant period. Briefly, DBA/2 mice were injected with Friend-virus-induced erythroleukemia cells. After 5 days of tumor growth, some mice received daily injections of poly I:C for the next 4 days while control, leukemic mice received the saline vehicle only. All mice were then irradiated (450 R x 2 at 4-hour intervals) and transplanted 1 day following irradiation with bone marrow from age- and sex-matched, normal DBA/2 donor mice.

Other identically treated mice subjected, however, to several additional rounds of poly I:C treatment were sampled 3 and 6 months after irradiation and bone marrow transplant. The results indicated that (a) poly I:C administered in the peritransplant period (before and after transplant) significantly increases the absolute numbers of NK cells in both the bone marrow and spleen of the transplanted host at all time intervals studied, (b) no erythroleukemic tumor cells were found, even as late as 6 months after transplant in the poly-I:C-treated hosts in spite of the fact that poly I:C treatment in this group had been terminated more than 2 months prior to tissue sampling, and (c) survival was significantly improved by pre- and posttransplant treatment with poly I:C.","['Currier, N L', 'Miller, S C']","['Currier NL', 'Miller SC']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Que., Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun,Natural immunity,9206126,"['0 (Interferon Inducers)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon Inducers/*pharmacology', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Poly I-C/*pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Spleen/cytology']",1998/10/28 03:02,2000/08/16 11:00,['1998/10/28 03:02'],"['1998/10/28 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [medline]', '1998/10/28 03:02 [entrez]']","['nam16006 [pii]', '10.1159/000069425 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Immun. 1998;16(1):6-17. doi: 10.1159/000069425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, many of these effects appear to be mediated by interactions between p19(Arf) and the p53 tumor-suppressor protein. Because Tp53 mutations are a common feature of the multistep pre-B cell transformation process mediated by Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MLV), we examined the possibility that proteins encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus also play a role in Abelson virus transformation. Analyses of primary transformants revealed that both p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) are expressed in many of the cells as they emerge from the apoptotic crisis that characterizes the transformation process. Analyses of primary transformants from Ink4a/Arf null mice revealed that these cells bypassed crisis. Because expression of p19(Arf) but not p16 (Ink4a) induced apoptosis in Ab-MLV-transformed pre-B cells, p19(Arf) appears to be responsible for these events. Consistent with the link between p19(Arf) and p53, Ink4a/Arf expression correlates with or precedes the emergence of cells expressing mutant p53. These data demonstrate that p19(Arf) is an important part of the cellular defense mounted against transforming signals from the Abl oncoprotein and provide direct evidence that the p19(Arf)-p53 regulatory loop plays an important role in lymphoma induction.","['Radfar, A', 'Unnikrishnan, I', 'Lee, H W', 'DePinho, R A', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Radfar A', 'Unnikrishnan I', 'Lee HW', 'DePinho RA', 'Rosenberg N']","['The Immunology Program, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/physiology', 'Genes, p16', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.22.13194 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Oct 27;95(22):13194-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.22.13194.,,"['R01 CA033771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY 11267/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC23757,,,,

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A metabolizes epipodophyllotoxins and other chemotherapeutic agents. CYP3A metabolism generates epipodophyllotoxin catechol and quinone metabolites, which could damage DNA. There is a polymorphism in the 5' promoter region of the CYP3A4 gene (CYP3A4-V) that might alter the metabolism of anticancer drugs. We examined 99 de novo and 30 treatment-related leukemias with a conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis assay for the presence of the CYP3A4-V. In all treatment-related cases, there was prior exposure to one or more anticancer drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Nineteen of 99 de novo (19%) and 1 of 30 treatment-related (3%) leukemias carried the CYP3A4-V (P = 0.026; Fisher's Exact Test, FET). Nine of 42 de novo leukemias with MLL gene translocations (21%), and 0 of 22 treatment-related leukemias with MLL gene translocations carried the CYP3A4-V (P = 0. 016, FET). This relationship remained significant when 19 treatment-related leukemias with MLL gene translocations that followed epipodophyllotoxin exposure were compared with the same 42 de novo cases (P = 0.026, FET). These data suggest that individuals with CYP3A4-W genotype may be at increased risk for treatment-related leukemia and that epipodophyllotoxin metabolism by CYP3A4 may contribute to the secondary cancer risk. The CYP3A4-W genotype may increase production of potentially DNA-damaging reactive intermediates. The variant may decrease production of the epipodophyllotoxin catechol metabolite, which is the precursor of the potentially DNA-damaging quinone.","['Felix, C A', 'Walker, A H', 'Lange, B J', 'Williams, T M', 'Winick, N J', 'Cheung, N K', 'Lovett, B D', 'Nowell, P C', 'Blair, I A', 'Rebbeck, T R']","['Felix CA', 'Walker AH', 'Lange BJ', 'Williams TM', 'Winick NJ', 'Cheung NK', 'Lovett BD', 'Nowell PC', 'Blair IA', 'Rebbeck TR']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Podophyllotoxin/*adverse effects', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Racial Groups', '*Transcription Factors', 'United States']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.22.13176 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Oct 27;95(22):13176-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.22.13176.,,"['1R29CA66140-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC23750,,,,

Antibody neutralization of beta transforming growth factor (TGFbeta) in serum-free medium decreased levels of p15(INK4B) and increased colony formation and retroviral-mediated transduction of primary human CD34(+) cells. Although TGFbeta neutralization increased colony formation from more primitive, noncycling hematopoietic progenitors, no increase in M-phase-dependent, retroviral-mediated transduction was observed.

Our results confirm and extend the observations of a bias in the use of certain VH, D, and JH genes among B-CLL cells. In addition, they indicate that the VH genes of approximately 50% of the IgM+ B-CLL cells and approximately 75% of the non-IgM+ B-CLL cells can exhibit somatic mutations. The presence of mutation varies according to the VH family expressed by the B-CLL cell (VH3 expressers displaying more mutation than VH1 and VH4 expressers). In addition, the extent of mutation can be sizeable with approximately 32% of the IgM+ cases and approximately 68% of the non-IgM+ cases differing by > 5% from the most similar germline gene. Approximately 20% of the mutated VH genes display replacement mutations in a pattern consistent with antigen selection. However, CDR3 characteristics (D and JH gene use and association and HCDR3 length, composition, and charge) suggest that selection for distinct B cell receptors (BCR) occurs in many more B-CLL cells. Based on these data, we suggest three prototypic BCR, representing the VH genes most frequently encountered in our study.

In a parallel-plate flow chamber, we measured the extent and rate of adhesion of rat basophilic leukemia cells preincubated with anti-dinitrophenyl IgE clones SPE-7 or H1 26. 82 to dinitrophenyl-coated polyacrylamide gel substrates in a linear shear field. Both of these IgEs bind dinitrophenyl, but H1 26.82 has a 10-fold greater on rate and a 30-fold greater affinity. Adhesion was found to be binary; cells either arrested irreversibly or continued at their unencumbered hydrodynamic velocity. Under identical conditions, more adhesion was seen with the higher affinity (higher on rate) IgE clone. At some shear rates, adhesion was robust with H1 26.82, but negligible with SPE-7. Reduction in receptor number or ligand density reduced the maximum level of adhesion seen at any shear rate, but did not decrease the shear rate at which adhesion was first observed. The spatial pattern of adhesion for both IgE clones is well represented by the first-order kinetic rate constant kad, and we have determined how kad depends on ligand and receptor densities and shear rate. The rate constant kad found with H1 26.82 was approximately fivefold greater than with SPE-7. The dependence of kad on site density and shear rate for SPE-7 is complex: kad increases linearly with antigen site density at low to moderate shear rates, but is insensitive to site density at high shear. kad increases with shear rate at low site density but decreases with shear at high site density. With H1 26.82, the functional dependence of kad with shear rate was similar. Although these data are consistent with the hypothesis that we have sampled both transport and reaction-limited adhesion regimes, they point out deficiencies in current theories describing cell attachment under flow.","['Swift, D G', 'Posner, R G', 'Hammer, D A']","['Swift DG', 'Posner RG', 'Hammer DA']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Gels)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions/immunology', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gels', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(98)77705-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77705-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1998 Nov;75(5):2597-611. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77705-7.,,['AI 35997/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1299935,,,,

Upon exposure to elevated temperatures, HSF1 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including inducible phosphorylation or hyperphosphorylation. To date, neither the role of HSF1 hyperphosphorylation in regulation of the transcriptional activity of HSF1 nor the signaling pathways involved have been characterized. We have previously shown that the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), markedly enhances the heat-induced stress response, and in the present study we elucidate the mechanism by which PKC activation affects the heat shock response in human cells. Our results show that several conventional and novel PKC isoenzymes are activated during the TPA-mediated enhancement of the heat shock response and that the enhancement can be inhibited by the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. Furthermore, the potentiating effect of TPA on the heat-induced stress response requires an intact heat shock element in the hsp70 promoter, indicating that PKC-responsive pathways are able to modulate the activity of HSF1. We also demonstrate that PKC is not activated by heat stress per se. These results reveal that PKC exhibits a significant modulatory role of the heat-induced stress response, but is not directly involved in regulation of the heat shock response.","['Holmberg, C I', 'Roos, P M', 'Lord, J M', 'Eriksson, J E', 'Sistonen, L']","['Holmberg CI', 'Roos PM', 'Lord JM', 'Eriksson JE', 'Sistonen L']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku, Abo Akademi University, PO Box 123, FIN-20521 Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat-Shock Response/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1998/10/28 00:00,1998/10/28 00:01,['1998/10/28 00:00'],"['1998/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1998 Nov;111 ( Pt 22):3357-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the key antileukemic agents, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara C), is clinically applied according to these therapeutic aims. However, the molecular effects of 0.1 microg/ml of ara C, a concentration that corresponds to the serum level in leukemic patients on a conventional dose of ara C, have not been well disclosed. Here, we addressed these issues using K562 cells which derived from a blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. DNA synthesis of treated cells was suppressed from 1-6 h. But, it recovered at 12 h and no further inhibition was observed. The number of cells was not decreased but DNA fragmentation was observed at 72 h. The number of erythroid-differentiated cells also increased to 30% at 72 h. Along with treatment, no marked alteration of mRNAs for cell cycle-regulating genes was found and the retinoblastoma gene product remained hyperphosphorylated throughout treatment. The expression of mRNAs for apoptosis-regulating genes also remained unchanged, except for slight down-regulation of Bax. c-myc protein was not found later than 48 h, and Max mRNA was downregulated. c-jun was immediately induced, followed by the fluctuated expression level along with treatment. These findings suggest that the 0.1 microg/ml ara C changed the proliferation, differentiation and death of K562 cells in a biphasic manner. In the early phase, DNA synthesis was inhibited without altering the expression of cell cycle regulating-genes. In the latter phase, cell death and erythroid- differentiation occurred in accordance with the down-regulation of c-myc.","['Yamada, H', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, J', 'Nagai, M', 'Takahara, S', 'Sekikawa, T', 'Kawano, T', 'Itoh, K', 'Fukumi, S', 'Iwase, S']","['Yamada H', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J', 'Nagai M', 'Takahara S', 'Sekikawa T', 'Kawano T', 'Itoh K', 'Fukumi S', 'Iwase S']","['Department of Internal Medicine (IV), Aoto Hospital, Institute of DNA Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Benzidines/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, cdc/genetics', 'Genes, jun', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006874931249 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1998 Oct;187(1-2):211-20. doi: 10.1023/a:1006874931249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present studies, we determined the effect of enforced overexpression of Apaf-1 on the apoptotic threshold in the human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Our findings demonstrate that both transient and stable transfections resulted in a 2.5-fold higher expression of Apaf-1, which was associated with approximately a 5-fold increase in the percentage of apoptosis in the transfectants (HL-60/Apaf-1) as compared with the control HL-60/neo cells. In cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, transient overexpression of Apaf-1 did not induce apoptosis. Stably overexpressing Apaf-1 levels significantly sensitized HL-60/Apaf-1 cells to apoptosis induced by clinically achievable concentrations of paclitaxel or etoposide (P < 0.01). This increase in paclitaxel- or etoposide-induced apoptosis of HL-60/Apaf-1 cells was not associated with any significant alterations in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Fas, or Fas ligand expression. It was, however, clearly associated with caspase-9 cleavage, as well as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DFF45 cleavage activity of caspase-3. Coexpression of the catalytically inactive, dominant-negative, mutant caspase-9, XIAP, or treatment with the caspase inhibitor, zVAD, significantly inhibited the increase in apoptosis of HL-60/Apaf-1 cells (P < 0.01).

Abnormalities in 11q22.3-q23.1 have also been described in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We analyzed B-CLL samples for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using microsatellite markers located at the ATM (D11S2179), mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL; D11S1356), and BCL1 (D11S987) loci, all of which are located around 11q23.

The purpose of this work was to study the accumulation of S16020-2 in Pgp-overexpressing cells. METHODS: The kinetics of accumulation and retention of radiolabeled S16020-2 and ADR in sensitive KB-3-1, P388, and S1 cells and their resistant counterparts KB-A1, P388/VCR-20, and S1/tMDR cells were investigated. RESULTS: The rates of efflux of S16020-2 and ADR were similar and were higher in KB-A1 cells than in KB-3-1 cells. A modulator of MDR, S9788, inhibited the efflux of both compounds only in KB-A1 cells. These results demonstrate that S16020-2 is effectively transported by Pgp overexpressed by KB-A1 cells with an efficiency close to that of ADR. A similar conclusion was obtained with the P388/VCR-20 cell line. In addition, the initial rate of uptake and the accumulation of S16020-2 were markedly higher than those of ADR in the cell lines tested. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic potency of S16020-2 toward tumor cells overexpressing Pgp is thus likely to be due to its rapid rate of uptake, which bypasses Pgp and thus leads to a high cellular accumulation.","['Pierre, A', 'Leonce, S', 'Perez, V', 'Atassi, G']","['Pierre A', 'Leonce S', 'Perez V', 'Atassi G']","['Institut de Recherches Servier, Division de Cancerologie Experimentale, Suresnes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (S 16020-2)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050845 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;42(6):454-60. doi: 10.1007/s002800050845.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The dose to the thyroid resulting from simulated cranial irradiation with parallel opposed lateral fields of an adult anthropomorphic (ART) phantom with both 6 MV X-rays and Cobalt-60 gamma-rays was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). The dependence of thyroid dose on the distance of the field from the thyroid and the proportions of thyroid dose from stray radiation (leakage, scatter from jaws, etc.) and tissue scattered radiation were measured. The effects of a shadow tray and shielding blocks were also determined. Calculation of thyroid dose using the Clarkson scatter integration method was performed for 6 MV X-rays to compare with the measured doses. In vivo thyroid dose estimates were made using TLD measurements for three children receiving PCI with 6 MV X-rays. RESULTS: Using open, unshielded fields, the thyroid region of the phantom received 1.2-1.4% of the prescribed cranial dose for 6 MV X-rays and 1.5-1.7% for Cobalt-60. For both treatment units, stray radiation accounted for approximately two thirds of the thyroid dose and tissue scatter accounted for the remaining one third. The thyroid dose increased as the field moved closer to the thyroid, with an increasing proportion of the dose due to tissue scatter. Placement of a thyroid shielding block on a shadow tray reduced the thyroid dose by only 20% compared with the open, unshielded setup. Thyroid dose from 6 MV using open fields was affected by the orientation of the collimator. When the inferior field edge was defined by the lower jaw, the dose was reduced by 27% compared with the upper jaw. Good correlation of dose to the thyroid region was obtained between phantom measured doses, in vivo measured doses and calculation of dose using the Clarkson method. CONCLUSION: For PCI doses of 1800 or 2400 cGy in the adult phantom, the dose to the thyroid was 20-40 cGy (1-2%). For small children this could rise to approximately 5% of the prescribed dose, of which half was due to stray radiation. As the thyroid in children is very sensitive to radiation and the dose-response curve for thyroid tumor induction is linear, attempts to shield the thyroid during cranial irradiation are mandatory. Cobalt-60 units should not be used, as the thyroid dose was higher than using 6 MV X-rays. Collimator orientation and the use of shadow trays and shielding were important factors in determining thyroid dose.","['Stevens, G', 'Downes, S', 'Ralston, A']","['Stevens G', 'Downes S', 'Ralston A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia. gstevensradonc.rpa.cs.nsw.gov.au.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Thermoluminescent Dosimetry', '*Thyroid Gland']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00222-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00222-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Sep 1;42(2):385-90. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00222-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen (VACA = vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin; or VAIA = vincristine, actinomycin D, ifosfamide, and adriamycin) and a total number of four courses, each lasting nine weeks, was recommended by the protocol. Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. RESULTS: The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%. The risk of solid tumors also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years. In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of all deaths within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM. Effective salvage therapy for secondary sarcomas is feasible.","['Dunst, J', 'Ahrens, S', 'Paulussen, M', 'Rube, C', 'Winkelmann, W', 'Zoubek, A', 'Harms, D', 'Jurgens, H']","['Dunst J', 'Ahrens S', 'Paulussen M', 'Rube C', 'Winkelmann W', 'Zoubek A', 'Harms D', 'Jurgens H']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'VACA protocol', 'VAIA protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dactinomycin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Sarcoma/*epidemiology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00228-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00228-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Sep 1;42(2):379-84. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00228-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because they are expressed and amplified in bacterial hosts, phage are not ideal for displaying eukaryotic polypeptides or for probing mammalian cells. As retroviruses do not suffer from these limitations we constructed plasmids encoding replication-competent murine leukemia viruses displaying a virally encoded epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain at the N-terminus of the envelope glycoprotein. The EGF-displaying viruses replicated freely on EGF receptor-poor cells without deleting the displayed EGF domain but did not propagate on EGF receptor-rich cells because they were sequestered by the EGF receptors. A retrovirus display library was then generated by diversifying the seven-residue linker between the envelope glycoprotein and the displayed EGF domain. Selective pressure for loss of EGF receptor-binding activity was applied to the library by serial passage on EGF receptor-rich HT1080 cells. The selected viruses propagated on these cells with wild-type efficiencies, a phenotype that was conferred by intracellular cleavage of their displayed linker sequences. The selected linker sequences invariably presented arginine-rich motifs matching the consensus cleavage signal for furin-like proteases. Retrovirus display libraries can be used for the selection of polypeptides interacting with components of living mammalian cells.","['Buchholz, C J', 'Peng, K W', 'Morling, F J', 'Zhang, J', 'Cosset, F L', 'Russell, S J']","['Buchholz CJ', 'Peng KW', 'Morling FJ', 'Zhang J', 'Cosset FL', 'Russell SJ']","['Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering, Medical Research Council Centre, England. bucch@pei.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/nbt1098-951 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 1998 Oct;16(10):951-4. doi: 10.1038/nbt1098-951.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Progressive renal dysfunction developed in two adolescent black girls with high-risk ALL who underwent renal biopsies that were consistent with FSGS. In both patients, no known etiologic factors, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, sickle cell anemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, were evident. FSGS induced by Adriamycin (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Columbus, OH) has been observed experimentally in rats. The patients had received anthracyclines and methotrexate, a known nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. RESULTS: One patient progressed to chronic renal failure and required prolonged dialysis followed by renal transplantation, though the leukemia remained in remission. The other patient is also in remission and on maintenance treatment for leukemia. She has persistent proteinuria and is currently undergoing a trial of high-dose steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The combination of FSGS with leukemia poses a management challenge to the clinician in terms of further treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs, complications of nephrotic syndrome (including infections), and timing of renal transplantation. Future studies should address whether FSGS represents a glomerular response to anthracycline-induced injury in susceptible black persons.","['Sathiapalan, R K', 'Velez, M C', 'McWhorter, M E', 'Irwin, K', 'Correa, H', 'Baliga, R', 'Warrier, R P']","['Sathiapalan RK', 'Velez MC', 'McWhorter ME', 'Irwin K', 'Correa H', 'Baliga R', 'Warrier RP']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Children's Hospital, New Orleans, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Rats']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199809000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Sep-Oct;20(5):482-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199809000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a literature search was performed to determine the prevalence of this complication in children with acute leukemia. RESULTS: On day 4 of induction chemotherapy for B-lineage ALL, the infant developed abdominal distension with hypoactive bowel sounds. After a barium enema and abdominal computed tomography scan, the symptoms were determined to be caused by an ileocecal intussusception. Chemotherapy was resumed 1 week after immediate surgical intervention (reduction of intussusception and resection of the ""leading edge"") with an uneventful post-operative recovery. Histopathologic examination of the resected edge revealed an intact mucosa with areas of necrosis in the submucosa. This was associated with a dense lymphoid infiltrate composed of mature lymphocytes and leukemic cells, edema, and focal necrosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using standard immune assays, cellular and humoral immunity was measured in 43 infants and children with cancer at completion of therapy and every 3 months thereafter for 1 year. There were 17 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 9 with Hodgkin disease, and 17 with solid nonhematopoietic tumors. All children had received standard childhood immunizations before diagnosis of cancer. Immune assays performed included circulating lymphocyte subpopulations, in vitro antigen-induced responses, and total concentrations of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, and IgG subclasses, and specific antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliovirus types I, II, and III. RESULTS: At completion of therapy, the majority of patients had low circulating lymphocyte subpopulations and antigen-induced responses. Serum antibody concentrations were low in up to 89% of patients regardless of the underlying malignancy. Although improvement occurred during the year of follow-up, 35 of 43 (81%) patients continued to exhibit one or more immune abnormalities 9 to 12 months after cessation of chemotherapy. Younger patients had more persistent alterations. Other risk factors studied (including gender, duration of therapy, and underlying malignancy) did not correlate with the severity of the immune defects. With the exception of poliovirus antibodies, specific antibody titers against common childhood vaccine antigens were deficient at completion of therapy and 9 to 12 months later in a substantial proportion of patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand one hundred forty-four boys with newly diagnosed ALL, enrolled in three consecutive trials of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster group (ALL-BFM 81, 83, 86), were retrospectively evaluated for the influence of MTX on testicular relapse-free interval. The basic treatment design was similar in all trials. No intravenous MTX was used in trial ALL-BFM 81 in the group who received cranial irradiation (CRT) except for a part of standard risk patients. Four courses of intermediate dose MTX (IDM) (0.5 g/m2) were introduced for all patients in trial ALL-BFM 83 (IDM group), which were replaced by high dose MTX (HDM) (5 g/m2) in trial ALL-BFM 86 (HDM group). The media observation time was > 9 years. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of isolated testicular relapses was significantly higher in the CRT group as compared to the IDM and HDM groups (6.7% versus 2.5% and 2.3%, p = 0.02 and 0.01). HDM decreased neither the incidence nor the rate of isolated testicular relapses any further. Event-free survival (EFS) for boys was similar between trial ALL-BFM 81 and 86 (64% versus 69%, p = 0.35), but differed significantly between trials ALL-BFM 83 and 86 (61% versus 69%, p = 0.0078). CONCLUSION: The introduction of IDM reduced the incidence of isolated testicular relapses significantly by a factor two, but had no significant influence on overall survival. HDM did not result in a more effective prevention of testicular relapses, but resulted in better systemic control and hence better survival than IDM.","['Dordelmann, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Fengler, R', 'Henze, G', 'Riehm, H', 'Schrappe, M']","['Dordelmann M', 'Reiter A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Fengler R', 'Henze G', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University-Children's Hospitals, Hannover Medical School, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199809000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Sep-Oct;20(5):444-50. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199809000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Full length, peer-reviewed articles describing the results of single agent phase I therapy trials in children younger than 21 years with cancer were reviewed. Tumor-specific response data and doses of drugs that resulted in objective responses were noted. Deaths that occurred on study caused by drug toxicity, progressive disease (PD), or complications of marrow aplasia were identified, along with drug doses that resulted in toxic death. Temporal trends in response rates, toxicity, and number of patients entered in trials were examined. RESULTS: A total of 1,606 patients with cancer were enrolled in 56 single-agent pediatric phase I therapy trials published between 1978 and 1996. Of these, 1,257 were evaluated for response by tumor type. The overall objective response rate was 7.9%. Response rates were highest for patients with neuroblastoma (17.7%) and acute myelogenous leukemia (11.6%). Patients with osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma had response rates of < 3%. Sixty percent of responses in patients with solid tumors occurred at 81 to 100% of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), although 42% of responses in patients with leukemia occurred at > 100% of the MTD. Death on study was noted in 7.0% of all patients entered in trials. Only 0.7% of patients experienced a death related to drug toxicity. PD accounted for the death of 5.6% of study participants. A trend of increasing response rate despite smaller trial size was noted over the last 7 years of this period. CONCLUSION: Phase I trials in children with cancer represent a safe mechanism to determine the MTD, toxicity profile, and pharmacokinetics of new agents for use in children with cancer.","['Shah, S', 'Weitman, S', 'Langevin, A M', 'Bernstein, M', 'Furman, W', 'Pratt, C']","['Shah S', 'Weitman S', 'Langevin AM', 'Bernstein M', 'Furman W', 'Pratt C']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7810, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/trends', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199809000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Sep-Oct;20(5):431-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199809000-00005.,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cryopreservation of semen and the intracytoplasmic sperm injection technique makes it possible to obtain pregnancy with very poor sperm quality. Two new semen retrieval methods are described that are applicable in pubertal boys with a fertility potential, although not psychologically ready to produce a semen sample, who are likely to become infertile because of anticancer therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two pubertal boys (aged 14 and 15 years) had a late testicular relapse of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin disease, stage II, respectively. In patient 1, penile vibratory stimulation (PVS) was tried under general anesthesia without success and electroejaculation (EEJ) was performed. Before alkylating chemotherapy and testicular irradiation, PVS was performed with success in patient 2. RESULTS: An antegrade ejaculate of 0.7 ml with 1% motile spermatozoa and an retrograde ejaculate with 1.6 x 10(6)/ml spermatozoa (5% with fair motility) was obtained from patient 1. An antegrade ejaculate of 1.5 ml with 2.5 x 10(6)/ml spermatozoa (29% with fair motility) was obtained from patient 2. CONCLUSIONS: PVS should be the first choice of treatment because it is noninvasive, simple, and easily applied.

In this study we show that high concentrations of soluble calcium induce the detachment of BM CD34(+) HPC adherent on fibronectin, a major component of BM extracellular matrix. Because G-CSF has been shown to induce osteoporosis in patients with congenital neutropenia and in G-CSF-overexpressing transgenic mice, we hypothesized that short-term G-CSF administration may be sufficient to induce bone resorption, resulting in the release of soluble calcium in the endosteum leading in turn to the inhibition of attachment to fibronectin and the egress of HPC from the BM. We show herein that in humans, serum osteocalcin concentration, a specific marker of bone formation, is strongly reduced after 3 days of G-CSF administration. Furthermore, in patients mobilized with G-CSF either alone or in association with stem cell factor or interleukin-3, the reduction of serum osteocalcin is significantly correlated with the number of HPC mobilized in peripheral blood. Urine levels of deoxypyridinoline (DPyr), a specific marker of bone resorption, gradually elevated during the time course of G-CSF administration until day 7 after cessation of G-CSF, showing a simultaneous stimulation of bone degradation during G-CSF-induced HPC mobilization. In an in vivo murine model, we found that the number of osteoclasts was dramatically increased paralleling the elevation of DPyr after G-CSF administration. When pamidronate, an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, was administered together with G-CSF in mice, the G-CSF-induced increase of DPyr levels was completely abolished whereas the numbers of colony-forming cells mobilized in peripheral blood were not decreased, but unexpectedly increased relative to the numbers elicited by G-CSF alone. Collectively, our data therefore show that short-term administration of G-CSF induces bone degradation by a simultaneous inhibition of bone formation and an enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. This increased bone resorption is inhibited by pamidronate without reducing G-CSF-induced HPC mobilization, suggesting that the activation of bone resorption after G-CSF administration is not the direct cause of HPC mobilization as initially hypothesized, but a parallel event.","['Takamatsu, Y', 'Simmons, P J', 'Moore, R J', 'Morris, H A', 'To, L B', 'Levesque, J P']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Simmons PJ', 'Moore RJ', 'Morris HA', 'To LB', 'Levesque JP']","['Matthew Roberts Laboratory, and the Leukaemia Research Unit, the Division of Haematology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '90032-33-0 (deoxypyridinoline)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acids/urine', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Resorption/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Diphosphonates/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fibronectins', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteocalcin/blood', 'Osteoclasts/*drug effects/physiology', 'Pamidronate', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57902-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3465-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

Structural analysis demonstrated that the mouse CPO gene spans approximately 11 kb and consists of seven exons, just like its human counterpart. Functional analysis of the promoter by transient transfection assays indicated that synergistic action between an SP-1-like element at -21/-12, a GATA site at -59/-54, and a novel regulatory element, CPRE (-GGACTACAG-) at -49/-41, is essential for the promoter activity in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. In nonerythroid NIH3T3 cells, however, the GATA site is not required. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that specific DNA-protein complexes can be formed with each element, and that there are cell-specific differences in factors, which bind to the SP-1-like element between MEL and NIH3T3 cells.

Allelic loss and mutation of this gene has been reported in epithelial derived tumors, including breast cancer and prostate cancer, and in glioblastoma multiforme. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential involvement of PTEN in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms. We analyzed 27 hematopoietic cell lines (representing a variety of lymphoid lineages), 65 primary lymphoid tumors (including 24 lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma [LBL], 30 large B-cell lymphoma [LBCL], 7 Burkitt's lymphoma [BL], and 4 anaplastic large cell lymphoma [ALCL]), and 25 nonmalignant lymph node controls. Gene deletion and gross rearrangement were evaluated using Southern blot analysis, and mutations were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing. Six of 27 cell lines (22.2%) and 3 of 65 primary lymphomas (4.6%) contained alterations of this gene. A large homozygous deletion spanning exons 2 through 5 was detected in one LBL cell line, and two insertions potentially resulting in premature termination, were detected in a second LBL cell line. Nonconservative nucleotide variations were found in two other cell lines (one LBCL and one BL) and in one primary case of LBCL. In addition, two other cell lines (one BL and one myeloma) and two primary lymphomas, both LBCL, contained small deletions within intron 7. These deletions mapped to a poly-T-rich tract just 5' to the intron 7/exon 8 spice site. Their significance is unclear, as they may represent polymorphisms. Overall, our results suggest that abnormalities of the PTEN gene can contribute to pathogenesis in a small percentage of malignant lymphomas.","['Sakai, A', 'Thieblemont, C', 'Wellmann, A', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Raffeld, M']","['Sakai A', 'Thieblemont C', 'Wellmann A', 'Jaffe ES', 'Raffeld M']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57894-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3410-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the evolution from chronic phase to blast crisis (BC) in CML patients is an inevitable clinical feature, little is understood about the mechanisms responsible for the transformation. We have previously performed allelotype analysis in CML BC and have detected frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 1. To know the common region of LOH where a putative tumor suppressor gene may reside, deletional mapping was performed using 33 microsatellite markers spanning chromosome 1 in 30 patients with CML BC (21 myeloid and 9 lymphoid). DNA was extracted from slides of bone marrow smears or from bone marrow mononuclear cells. In each patient, DNA from chronic phase was analyzed alongside DNA from either their BC or accelerated phase. Allelic loss on 1p was observed in 14 of the 30 individuals (47%): 10 of the 21 myeloid and 4 of the 9 lymphoid BC cases. Serial cytogenetic information was available in 10 cases with LOH on 1p; interestingly, deletions in this region were not detected. Two samples showed LOH at all informative loci on 1p, whereas the other 12 samples showed LOH on at least one but not all loci on 1p. The common region of LOH resided proximal to D1S508 and distal to D1S507 (1p36). Our results suggest that a tumor suppressor gene that frequently plays an important role in the evolution to BC resides on 1p36 in CML.","['Mori, N', 'Morosetti, R', 'Spira, S', 'Lee, S', 'Ben-Yehuda, D', 'Schiller, G', 'Landolfi, R', 'Mizoguchi, H', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Mori N', 'Morosetti R', 'Spira S', 'Lee S', 'Ben-Yehuda D', 'Schiller G', 'Landolfi R', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Koeffler HP']","['Departments of Medicine and Clinical Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57893-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3405-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

When cells were incubated in the presence of both dCF and 2'-deoxyadenosine (dAd), the concentration of dCF required to induce apoptosis of monocytoid leukemia cells was much lower than that required for myeloid, erythroid, or lymphoma cell lines. Among the cell lines tested, U937 cells were the most sensitive to this treatment. The concentration of dCF that effectively inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells was 1/1,000 of that required for lymphoma cell lines, on a molar basis. However, the uptake of dCF or dAd in U937 cells was comparable with that in other leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. The intracellular accumulation of dATP in U937 cells was only slightly higher than that in other leukemia cells in dCF-treated culture. Treatment with dCF plus dAd induced apoptosis in U937 cells at low concentrations, and this apoptosis was reduced by treatment with caspase inhibitors. Induction of caspase-3 (CPP32) activity accompanied the apoptosis induced by dCF plus dAd. No activation of CPP32 was observed in cytosol prepared from exponentially growing leukemia and lymphoma cells. However, dATP effectively induced CPP32 activation in cytosol from monocytoid cells, but not in that from nonmonocytoid cells, suggesting that dATP-dependent CPP32 activation is at least partly involved in the preferential induction of apoptosis in monocytoid leukemia cells. The combination of dCF and dAd may be useful for the clinical treatment of acute monocytic leukemia.","['Niitsu, N', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Umeda, M', 'Honma, Y']","['Niitsu N', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Umeda M', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Saitama, University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)"", ""P582C98ULC (2'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pentostatin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'U937 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57888-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3368-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

We investigated this possibility by studying peripheral blood leukocytes from normal individuals and various hematopoietic cell lines for the presence and expression of the p210 and the p190 types of the BCR-ABL gene associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We used two-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in which batches of 10(8) cells per sample were tested in 40 replicate reactions. We estimate that this assay is 1.5 logs more sensitive than the two-step RT-PCR assays that we use routinely to assess minimal residual disease. BCR-ABL fusion gene transcripts of various configurations were found in circulating leukocytes from 12 of the 16 healthy adults analyzed. Transcripts with an e1a2 junction (p190 BCR-ABL) were present in 11 and p210-type transcripts with b2a2 and/or b3a2 junctions were detected in 4 individuals. The same RT-PCR assays in non-CML cell lines showed the presence of classical or aberrant p210-type mRNA in 3 of 7 lines and of p190-type transcripts in all 7 lines of hematopoietic origin (HL60, KG1, U937, Kasumi, Jurkat, JVM13, and JVM25), whereas the NIH3T3 murine fibroblast line was reproducibly negative for these fusion genes. These findings confirm and extend previous reports on the detection of leukemia-associated genes in normal leukocytes and suggest that certain fusion genes are generated relatively frequently in hematopoietic cells, but only infrequently do the cells acquire the additional changes necessary to produce leukemia in humans. Although there is only a small probability that such innocent BCR-ABL-carrying leukocytes are detected by conventional RT-PCR assays, they may be the source of some sporadically positive tests in leukemia patients in long-term remission.","['Bose, S', 'Deininger, M', 'Gora-Tybor, J', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Bose S', 'Deininger M', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57887-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3362-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

Seven CD4(+) T-cell clones that responded to stimulation with b3a2 peptide, but not with b2a2 peptide or physiological counterparts bcr b3b4 and abl 1A-a2 peptides, were established from two healthy individuals. Restriction elements of these clones were HLA-DRB1*0901.

These cells, termed cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, are composed primarily of T cells, and the population of cells with the greatest cytotoxic activity is an otherwise rare population of CD3(+)CD56(+) cells that expand dramatically under these culture conditions. CIK cells were expanded from PBMNCs from 13 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). These cultures contained a variable number of T cells at the start of the culture (median 44%, range 1% to 64%), yet after 21 to 28 days of culture, virtually all of the cells were CD3(+) T cells (median 97%, range 90% to 99%). The CD3(+)CD56(+) subset of cells expanded significantly (median 25-fold, range 2.2- to 525-fold). CIK cells from all patients showed cytotoxicity against the tumor cell lines OCI-LY8 and K562. In four patients the expanded CIK cells suppressed colony growth of autologous CML blast cells and myeloid progenitor cells. Allogeneic CIK cells from normal donors also suppressed CML colony growth but did not inhibit growth of normal hematopoietic colonies. Twelve of the 13 cultures were exclusively composed of Philadelphia (Ph)-negative cells and one culture had 1 out of 20 Ph-positive metaphases after 4 weeks in culture. Intracellular cytokine production was assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), and the expanded T-cell cultures produced IL-2, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but not IL-4. Both the CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets secreted this cytokine profile. To test the in vivo activity of the expanded CIK cells, CML was engrafted into severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice using matrigel. After 4 weeks, 4 x 10(7) autologous CIK cells were injected intravenously by tail vein injection into groups of mice, and the animals were sacrificed after a total of 18 weeks. Bcr-abl was detected in the bone marrow or spleen of 5 out of 6 control mice and only 2 out of 13 mice who received the autologous CIK cells (P = .02). In an additional series of animals, the mice did not engraft with CML but instead developed large human Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphomas by 12 weeks. The mice who received autologous CIK cells at 4 weeks had either no tumor (5) or small tumors (5), whereas all 10 mice that received CIK cells at week 8 developed lymphomas; however, these were not as large as in the 10 control mice who did not receive CIK cells (P = . 03). This study shows that CIK cells, which are Ph chromosome-negative, can be expanded from patients with CML and have potent in vitro and in vivo efficacy against autologous tumor cells.","['Hoyle, C', 'Bangs, C D', 'Chang, P', 'Kamel, O', 'Mehta, B', 'Negrin, R S']","['Hoyle C', 'Bangs CD', 'Chang P', 'Kamel O', 'Mehta B', 'Negrin RS']","['Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine; the Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'Collagen', 'Drug Combinations', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/transmission', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation/virology', 'Laminin', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Muromonab-CD3/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proteoglycans', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology/virology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57882-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3318-27.,,['CA-49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

However, the effects of Mcl-1 are generally short lived compared with those of Bcl-2 and are not obvious in some transfectants. To further explore the effects of this gene, mice were produced that expressed Mcl-1 as a transgene in hematolymphoid tissues. The Mcl-1 transgene was found to cause moderate viability enhancement in a wide range of hematopoietic cell types, including lymphoid (B and T) as well as myeloid cells at both immature and mature stages of differentiation. However, enhanced hematopoietic capacity in transgenic bone marrow and spleen was not reflected in any change in pool sizes in the peripheral blood. In addition, among transgenic cells, mature T cells remained long lived compared with B cells and macrophages could live longer than either of these. Interestingly, when hematopoietic cells were maintained in tissue culture in the presence of interleukin-3, Mcl-1 enhanced the probability of outgrowth of continuously proliferating myeloid cell lines. Thus, Mcl-1 transgenic cells remained subject to normal in vivo homeostatic mechanisms controlling viable cell number, but these constraints could be overridden under specific conditions in vitro. Within the organism, Bcl-2 family members may act at ""viability gates"" along the differentiation continuum, functioning as part of a system for controlled hematopoietic cell amplification. Enforced expression of even a moderate viability-promoting member of this family such as Mcl-1, within a conducive intra- and extracellular environment in isolation from normal homeostatic constraints, can substantially increase the probability of cell immortalization.","['Zhou, P', 'Qian, L', 'Bieszczad, C K', 'Noelle, R', 'Binder, M', 'Levy, N B', 'Craig, R W']","['Zhou P', 'Qian L', 'Bieszczad CK', 'Noelle R', 'Binder M', 'Levy NB', 'Craig RW']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Pathology, Anatomy, and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transgenes']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57872-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3226-39.,,"['R01-CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-CA54385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

In this study, we present evidence that in mice, the spleen contains a long-lived myeloid-committed stem cell population(s) that continuously replenishes the mature myeloid lineage for at least 9 months. After myeloid-specific retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the exogenous gene could be detected in thioglycollate-induced macrophages and granulocytes by Southern blot analysis and by in situ polymerase chain reaction on an individual cell basis. The targeted stem cell population does not repopulate the bone marrow in secondary recipients and did not give rise to cells other than cells of the myeloid lineage. It therefore represents the first nonpluripotential stem cell population capable of replenishing a hemopoietic lineage for a long period of time.

With regard to rejection, donor HLA disparity was 1 (5), 2 (6), or 3 loci (2). With regard to GVHD, recipient HLA disparity was 0 (1), 1 (3), 2 (8), or 3 (1). The patients suffered from acute myelogenous leukemia (6), chronic myelogenous leukemia (4), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2), or hemolytic anemia plus immunodeficiency disorder (1). To reduce the risk of graft failure through the infusion of a large amount of stem cells, peripheral blood cells (PBC) were mobilized by recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; lenograstim, 10 microgram/kg/d for 5 days) and collected by 2 to 5 aphereses. To both enhance engraftment and reduce GVHD, CD34(+) cells were enriched using immunomagnetic procedures with the Baxter ISOLEX 300 system (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Irvine, CA) and cryopreserved. After variable cytoreductive regimens, a median of 7.7 (range, 2.2 to 14) x 10(6)/kg of CD34(+) cells and 1.03 (0.05 to 2.09) x 10(5)/kg CD3(+) cells were infused. Using Center-specific posttransplant supportive care and immunosuppressive GVHD prophylaxis, two patients experienced early death; one from veno-occlusive disease at day 17 and one from sepsis at day 18. Nine of 11 patients showed signs of engraftment; however, subsequent rejection was seen in 4 patients, 2 of whom had autologous recovery. Eight patients were evaluated in the early phase of marrow recovery. The median number of days to achieve an absolute granulocyte count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 14 (range, 9 to 20) and that to achieve a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/L was 17.5 (range, 12 to 23). Donor chimerism persisted in five patients until death or current survival. All of the surviving patients with functioning-donor-type hematopoiesis were given total body irradiation. De novo acute GVHD (grades II and IV) was observed in two of the eight evaluated patients. Scheduled donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), using the CD34(-) fraction, was administered to four patients, free of de novo acute GVHD, beginning between 28 to 43 days after transplant. Three of these patients developed acute GVHD (grades I, II, and IV). Cytomegalovirus infection was a major infectious complication but was successfully managed with gamma-globulin and gancyclovir treatment with or without additional DLI. Five patients are currently surviving, free of disease, with a follow-up ranging from 476 to 937 days. Each survivor has functioning hematopoiesis, three of donor origin and two of autologous origin. In conclusion, our results show that enriched blood CD34(+) cells from a mismatched haploidentical donor are a feasible alternative source of stem cells, but do not appear to ensure engraftment. Because none of the patients who were administered DLI survived, the therapeutic efficacy and safety of periodic DLI, as an integrated part of such transplants, needs to be clarified in further studies.","['Kawano, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Watanabe, A', 'Takeda, O', 'Arai, K', 'Itoh, E', 'Ohno, Y', 'Teshima, T', 'Harada, M', 'Watanabe, T', 'Okamoto, Y', 'Abe, T', 'Kajiume, T', 'Matsushita, T', 'Ikeda, K', 'Endo, M', 'Kuroda, Y', 'Asano, S', 'Tanosaki, R', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Law, P', 'McMannis, J D']","['Kawano Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Watanabe A', 'Takeda O', 'Arai K', 'Itoh E', 'Ohno Y', 'Teshima T', 'Harada M', 'Watanabe T', 'Okamoto Y', 'Abe T', 'Kajiume T', 'Matsushita T', 'Ikeda K', 'Endo M', 'Kuroda Y', 'Asano S', 'Tanosaki R', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Law P', 'McMannis JD']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokushima, Tokushima; National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo; the Department of Pediatrics, University of Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimera', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lenograstim', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Nuclear Family', 'Parents', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/*immunology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57860-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3123-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

In this study, we have investigated the relationship between sL-selectin levels and clinical presentation or disease outcome in 100 patients with AML. Fifty-eight patients were found to have sL-selectin levels >/=3.12 microgram/mL (>/=3 SD above the mean of healthy controls: ""increased""). Patients with extramedullary disease such as lymphadenopathies, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and/or muco-cutaneous infiltration had significantly increased sL-selectin levels (P < .001). sL-selectin levels were significantly heterogeneous in the French-American-British subtypes (P = .0003). Patients with ""normal"" sL-selectin levels had higher probability of achieving complete remission (CR) than with ""increased"" levels: 81% versus 64%, respectively (P = .06). When adjusting for clinically relevant covariates predictive for CR (sex, age, Auer rods), ""normal"" sL-selectin levels were significantly associated with CR (odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 8.58; P = .03). Moreover, patients with ""increased"" sL-selectin levels (>/=3.12 microgram/mL) had shorter event-free survival (EFS) (median 7.3 v 12 months, P = .008) and overall survival (median 1 v 2.05 years, P = .03) than patients with sL-selectin <3.12 microgram/mL. Multivariate statistical analysis (adjusted for age and presence of Auer rods) indicated that sL-selectin was an independent prognostic factor for EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.17, P = .006) and overall survival (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.98; P = .02).

Using quantitative Western blot analysis, we studied the levels of nonactivated (uncleaved) caspase 2 and 3 in peripheral blood low-density cells from 185 patients with newly diagnosed AML. We also measured the level of activated (cleaved) caspase 3 in 41 randomly selected samples from the 185 patients. Finally, we analyzed the effect of caspase 2 and 3 levels and other prognostic variables on patient survival using a multivariate Cox model. We found that median levels of nonactivated caspase 2 and 3 were higher in AML than in normal peripheral blood cells (P < .001 and P <.02, respectively). There was no association between caspase level and either the percentage of peripheral blasts or any specific type of leukemia cell cytogenetic abnormalities. When the effect of each uncleaved caspase was considered individually, a high level of uncleaved caspase 3 (P = .04), but not of caspase 2 (P = .16), was associated with decreased survival. Conversely, a high level of cleaved caspase 3 denoted improved survival and correlated with the inactivation of the DNA-repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Thus, cleaved caspase 3 could stimulate the apoptotic cascade further, and lack of its activation likely caused an accumulation of the uncleaved caspase. Although uncleaved caspase 2 level per se had no prognostic significance, the interactive effect of high levels of both uncleaved caspase 2 and 3 denoted very poor survival (P < .001) and had the largest effect of all prognostic variables (P < .001; estimated relative risk, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.59 to 3. 90).

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether activated caspases are phosphorylated. Phosphatase treatment of cytosolic extracts containing active caspases followed by affinity labeling with N-(N-benzyloxycarbonylglutamyl-N-biotinyllysyl)aspartic acid [(2, 6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy] methyl ketone (Z-EK(bio)D-aomk) showed a mobility shift in several of the labeled species, suggesting that phosphorylated forms of these enzymes are present in the extracts. Metabolic labeling with 32P followed by etoposide treatment and subsequent affinity purification of affinity-labeled caspases confirmed that at least three caspase species were phosphorylated. To detect effects of the phosphorylation on enzymatic activity, caspase-mediated cleavage of aspartylglutamylvalinylaspartyl-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (DEVD-AFC) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by phosphorylated and dephosphorylated extracts was measured. No significant changes in Km or vmax were detected using DEVD-AFC. In contrast, a slight, but significant enhancement of PARP cleavage was observed in dephosphorylated extracts, suggesting that phosphorylation of active caspases could have an inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. These observations, which provide the first evidence that caspases are phosphoproteins, suggest that caspases may be targets for some of the growing list of protein kinases that are involved in apoptotic events.","['Martins, L M', 'Kottke, T J', 'Kaufmann, S H', 'Earnshaw, W C']","['Martins LM', 'Kottke TJ', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Earnshaw WC']","['Institute of Cell & Molecular Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK; and the Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Coumarins/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57850-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3042-9.,,"['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

Plasma-derived factor V (FV) is synthesized by the liver, whereas the source of the platelet-derived cofactor has not been unambiguously identified. Megakaryocytes, platelet precursors, are known to synthesize platelet proteins and to endocytose proteins from plasma (ie, fibrinogen) and then package these proteins into alpha-granules. To determine which mechanism accounts for FV presence in platelets, two patients heterozygous for FVLeiden who underwent allogeneic transplantation from homozygous FV wild-type donors (bone marrow [BM] or liver) were studied. Patient JMW, whose skin biopsy specimen showed heterozygous FVLeiden, received a BM transplant from a wild-type homozygous FV donor as analyzed from posttransplant peripheral blood cells. Patient FW, whose native liver is heterozygous for FVLeiden, received a homozygous wild-type FV liver. Because each individual has two distinct genetic pools of factor V in liver and megakaryocytes, it was possible to determine whether secretable platelet-derived FV was normal or contained the FVLeiden mutation. Platelet-derived FVa released from thrombin-activated platelets from a normal individual, an individual heterozygous for the FVLeiden mutation, and the two patients was incubated with phospholipid vesicles and activated protein C (APC). Western blotting analyses using a monoclonal antibody that allows distinction between platelet-derived FVa and FVaLeiden subsequent to APC-catalyzed cleavage were then performed. Based on the accumulation of proteolytic fragments derived from APC-induced cleavage, analyses of platelet-derived FVa from JMW demonstrated both normal FVa and FVaLeiden consistent with a plasma-derived origin of the secretable platelet-derived FVa. Western blotting analyses of the APC-cleaved platelet-derived FVa from FW showed a wild-type phenotype, despite the presence of a FVLeiden allele in her megakaryocyte genome, also consistent with a plasma origin of her secretable platelet-derived FVa. Platelets do not appear to endocytose the plasma cofactor, because a 35-hour incubation of platelet-rich plasma with 125I-factor V showed no specific association/uptake of the radiolabeled ligand with the platelet pellet. Collectively, these results show for the first time that the majority of secretable platelet-derived factor V is endocytosed by megakaryocytes from plasma and is not exclusively synthesized by these cells, as previously believed.","['Camire, R M', 'Pollak, E S', 'Kaushansky, K', 'Tracy, P B']","['Camire RM', 'Pollak ES', 'Kaushansky K', 'Tracy PB']","[""Department of Biochemistry, University of Vermont, College of Medicine, Burlington; the Division of Hematology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein C)', '0 (factor V Leiden)', '65522-14-7 (Factor Va)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Budd-Chiari Syndrome/surgery', 'Chimera', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics', 'Endocytosis', 'Factor V/*metabolism', 'Factor Va/metabolism', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma/*metabolism', 'Protein C/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57849-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3035-41.,,['HL PO1-46703/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Blood. 1999 May 1;93(9):3152-3.

Frequent FGFR3 kinase activating mutations in MM with t(4;14) translocations substantiate an oncogenic role for FGFR3. We now report that the 4p16 breakpoints occur telomeric to and within the 5' introns of a novel gene, MMSET (Multiple Myeloma SET domain). In normal tissues, MMSET has a complex pattern of expression with a short form (647 amino acids [aa]) containing an HMG box and hath region, and an alternatively spliced long form (1365 aa) containing the HMG box and hath region plus 4 PHD fingers and a SET domain. Although t(4;14) translocation results in IgH/MMSET hybrid transcripts, overexpression of MMSET also occurs from endogenous promoters on 4p16. Given the homology to HRX/MLL1/ALL1 at 11q23 that is dysregulated by translocations in acute leukemia, we hypothesize that dysregulation of MMSET contributes to neoplastic transformation in MM with t(4;14) translocation. This is the first example of an IgH translocation that simultaneously dysregulates two genes with oncogenic potential: FGFR3 on der(14) and MMSET on der(4).","['Chesi, M', 'Nardini, E', 'Lim, R S', 'Smith, K D', 'Kuehl, W M', 'Bergsagel, P L']","['Chesi M', 'Nardini E', 'Lim RS', 'Smith KD', 'Kuehl WM', 'Bergsagel PL']","['Department of Medicine, the Division of Hematology and Oncology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (IgH-MMSET fusion protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57848-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3025-34.,"['GENBANK/AF071593', 'GENBANK/AF071594', 'GENBANK/AF071595']",['CA74265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Blood. 2001 Aug 15;98(4):1271-2.

Germline mutations in the Fas gene have been associated with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, and somatic Fas mutations have been found in multiple myeloma. We have examined the entire coding region and all splice sites of the Fas gene in 150 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Overall, mutations were identified in 16 of the tumors (11%). Missense mutations within the death domain of the receptor were associated with retention of the wild-type allele, indicating a dominant-negative mechanism, whereas missense mutations outside the death domain were associated with allelic loss. Fas mutations were identified in 3 (60%) MALT-type lymphomas, 9 (21%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 2 (6%) follicle center cell lymphomas, 1 (50%) anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and 1 unusual case of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia with a marked tropism for skin. Among the 16 patients with somatic Fas mutations, 15 showed extranodal disease at presentation, and 6 relapsed in extranodal areas. Ten of 13 evaluable patients showed features suggestive of autoreactive disease. Our data indicate that somatic disruption of Fas may play a role in the pathogenesis of some lymphomas, and suggest a link between Fas mutation, cancer and autoimmunity.","['Gronbaek, K', 'Straten, P T', 'Ralfkiaer, E', 'Ahrenkiel, V', 'Andersen, M K', 'Hansen, N E', 'Zeuthen, J', 'Hou-Jensen, K', 'Guldberg, P']","['Gronbaek K', 'Straten PT', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Ahrenkiel V', 'Andersen MK', 'Hansen NE', 'Zeuthen J', 'Hou-Jensen K', 'Guldberg P']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society; the Departments of Pathology and Hematology, Herlev Hospital; and the Departments of Hematology and Pathology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications/genetics', 'Autoimmunity/*genetics', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/complications/genetics"", 'Thyroiditis, Autoimmune/complications/genetics', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/physiology']",1998/10/27 00:00,1998/10/27 00:01,['1998/10/27 00:00'],"['1998/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57847-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3018-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology'],,,,,,

SCL is expressed in committed erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic cells as well as in hematopoietic stem cells. Nothing is known about the regulation of SCL transcription in mast cells, and in other lineages GATA-1 is the only tissue-specific transcription factor recognized to regulate the SCL gene. We have therefore analyzed the molecular mechanisms underlying SCL expression in mast cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that SCL promoter 1a was regulated by GATA-1 together with Sp1 and Sp3 in a manner similar to the situation in erythroid cells. However, SCL promoter 1b was strongly active in mast cells, in marked contrast to the situation in erythroid cells. Full activity of promoter 1b was dependent on ETS and Sp1/3 motifs. Transcription factors PU.1, Elf-1, Sp1, and Sp3 were all present in mast cell extracts, bound to promoter 1b and transactivated promoter 1b reporter constructs. These data provide the first evidence that the SCL gene is a direct target for PU.1, Elf-1, and Sp3.","['Bockamp, E O', 'Fordham, J L', 'Gottgens, B', 'Murrell, A M', 'Sanchez, M J', 'Green, A R']","['Bockamp EO', 'Fordham JL', 'Gottgens B', 'Murrell AM', 'Sanchez MJ', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, Medical Research Council Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF1 protein, human)', '0 (Elf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1998/10/24 00:00,1998/10/24 00:01,['1998/10/24 00:00'],"['1998/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.44.29032 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59489-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 30;273(44):29032-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.44.29032.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships among several factors related to proliferation and apoptosis in LAM cells, we employed immunohistochemical methods for the localization of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (inhibitors of apoptosis), Bax (a promoter of apoptosis), c-Myc (an apoptosis-related oncoprotein), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (an indicator of mitotic activity), and nick end labeling (to identify apoptotic cells) in lung tissues of 9 patients with LAM. RESULTS: In all patients, most LAM cells reacted positively for Bax. The LAM cells were positive for both Bcl-2 and estrogen receptor in 5 patients, positive for only Bcl-2 in 1 patient, positive for only estrogen receptor in another patient, and negative for both in 2 patients. More than 50% of the Bcl-2-positive LAM cells were also positive for estrogen receptor. The reaction for c-Myc was positive in all patients. The immunoreactivity for Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, which inhibit apoptosis, was more intense in LAM cells than in normal vascular and bronchial smooth muscle cells. In 6 patients, more than 50% of the LAM cells were positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Apoptosis was infrequent in LAM cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the expression of Bcl-2 in LAM cells may be related to hormonal regulation, and that by decreasing apoptosis, Bcl-2 and related proteins contribute to the imbalance between proliferation and death of LAM cells.","['Usuki, J', 'Horiba, K', 'Chu, S C', 'Moss, J', 'Ferrans, V J']","['Usuki J', 'Horiba K', 'Chu SC', 'Moss J', 'Ferrans VJ']","['Pathology Section, Pulmonary-Critical Care Medicine Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1518, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lung Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphangiomyoma/*chemistry/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Staining and Labeling', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/10/24 00:00,1998/10/24 00:01,['1998/10/24 00:00'],"['1998/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1998 Oct;122(10):895-902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the later studies patients outcomes with new intensive regimens employing early intensification and reinduction therapy were apparently better than those of patients in the early studies with conventional regimens. When we compared the number of relapsed patients based on duration of first remission, we found that the improved outcomes for patients in the later studies were due to a decrease in the number who relapsed 7-36 months after the start of treatment (intermediate relapse), and that the percentage of those who relapsed within the first 6 months of therapy (early relapse) was higher. Patients with high initial WBC counts tended to relapse much earlier than those with low initial WBC counts. However, in the later studies, patients with high WBC counts often relapsed after the termination of therapy (late relapse).

We assessed the relative sensitivity of morphology, FCM, and consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of antigen receptor genes in the detection of marrow involvement. In 78 of 100 (78%) cases, there was concordance between FCM and PCR. FCM detected more cases of clonality in B-cell neoplasia. There were 40 cases with objective evidence of involvement by B-cell neoplasia. In this group, FCM had a sensitivity of 97.5% (39 of 40); PCR had a sensitivity of 67.5% (27 of 40). In contrast, PCR had a sensitivity of 71.4%, and FCM a sensitivity of 28.6%, in T-cell neoplasia. In all 12 cases with involvement detected by biopsy, there was objective evidence of clonality. However, clonality was detected in four of seven patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in five of eight patients with T-cell neoplasia in the absence of morphologically detectable disease. Clonality was identified in only one of seven patients with B-cell lymphoma in which the biopsy was interpreted as ""suspicious but not diagnostic of involvement."" We conclude that morphology remains of central importance in the evaluation of marrow involvement in NHL. We show that FCM and PCR identify involvement in the absence of morphologically apparent disease. In B-cell neoplasms, FCM remains the method of choice for the detection of clonality. PCR for T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may be an important adjunct to the diagnosis of marrow involvement in patients with T-cell neoplasms.","['Crotty, P L', 'Smith, B R', 'Tallini, G']","['Crotty PL', 'Smith BR', 'Tallini G']","['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8070, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemistry/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/10/24 00:00,1998/10/24 00:01,['1998/10/24 00:00'],"['1998/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199804000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1998 Apr;7(2):90-5. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199804000-00005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anagrelide is a selective thrombocytopenic agent with FDA-approved labeling for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia. Clinical trials have shown that the drug may have a role in the treatment of other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, including polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia, and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. The mechanism by which anagrelide reduces platelet count is not yet clear. The current hypothesis is that anagrelide affects the late (postmitotic) phases of megakaryocyte development. Anagrelide has a large volume of distribution and is extensively metabolized; less than 1% is recovered unchanged in the urine. Plasma half-life after a 0.5-mg dose is 1.3 hours. Anagrelide's efficacy and safety have been evaluated in open-label, noncomparative trials, in which the response rate was 60-93%. Adverse effects include headache, diarrhea, edema, palpitations, and abdominal pain. Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction need to be closely monitored for signs of toxicity. The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg four times a day or 1 mg twice a day, with dosage adjustment to the lowest effective amount required to reduce and maintain platelet count below 600 x 10(9)/L. The wholesale acquisition price for 0.5-mg capsules is $350 per 100. Whether anagrelide will replace hydroxyurea as first-line therapy in some or all patients remains to be determined.

Internalization of L. monocytogenes into endothelial cells has been previously demonstrated by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells as a model system. However, during the crossing of the blood-brain barrier, L. monocytogenes most likely encounters brain microvascular endothelial cells which are strikingly different from macrovascular or umbilical vein endothelial cells. In the present study human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were used to study the interaction of L. monocytogenes with endothelial cells, which closely resemble native microvascular endothelial cells of the brain. We show that L. monocytogenes invades HBMEC in an InlB-dependent and wortmannin-insensitive manner. Once within the HBMEC, L. monocytogenes replicates efficiently over a period of at least 18 h, moves intracellularly by inducing actin tail formation, and spreads from cell to cell. Using a green fluorescent protein-expressing L. monocytogenes strain, we present direct evidence that HBMEC are highly resistant to damage by intracellularly growing L. monocytogenes. Infection of HBMEC with L. monocytogenes results in foci of heavily infected, but largely undamaged endothelial cells. Heterologous plaque assays with L. monocytogenes-infected P388D1 macrophages as vectors demonstrate efficient spreading of L. monocytogenes into HBMEC, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and epithelial cells, and this phenomenon is independent of the inlC gene product.","['Greiffenberg, L', 'Goebel, W', 'Kim, K S', 'Weiglein, I', 'Bubert, A', 'Engelbrecht, F', 'Stins, M', 'Kuhn, M']","['Greiffenberg L', 'Goebel W', 'Kim KS', 'Weiglein I', 'Bubert A', 'Engelbrecht F', 'Stins M', 'Kuhn M']","['Lehrstuhl fur Mikrobiologie, Theodor-Boveri-Institut fur Biowissenschaften der Universitat Wurzburg, 97074 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (inlB protein, Listeria monocytogenes)', '0 (inlC protein, Listeria monocytogenes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/physiology', 'Brain/*blood supply/*microbiology/pathology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*microbiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*microbiology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Listeria monocytogenes/drug effects/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Macrophages/*microbiology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Virulence']",1998/10/24 00:00,1998/10/24 00:01,['1998/10/24 00:00'],"['1998/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/IAI.66.11.5260-5267.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1998 Nov;66(11):5260-7. doi: 10.1128/IAI.66.11.5260-5267.1998.,,['R01-US 26310/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC108657,,,,

We observed a statistically significant inhibition of proliferation, dose and time dependent, of the human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937. This inhibition was associated with a dose dependent decrease in the number of CFU-blasts in clonogenic cultures. Cytostatic effect was obtained with doses of 5 microM for estrogen and 10 microM for androgen and was not due to a non-specific cytotoxic effect, some cell viability remained high (> 90%) even after 6 days of incubation. More accurately, we demonstrated that growth inhibition was associated with a cell cycle arrest, U937 cells accumulating in G2/M phase. This blockade was dose related with a maximum number of cells accumulating at day 4. Sensitivity of these cells to an S-phase specific agent (hydroxyurea) was not increased, suggesting that these cells were blocked in G2/M and did not undergo mitosis. Expression in U937 cells of high affinity nuclear receptors for estrogen and androgen was negative which was in favour of a type II estrogen binding site, mediated mechanism. Moreover, a small fraction of these cells underwent apoptosis or differentiation with about 12% apoptotic cells and a significant increase (more than 30%) of two myelomonocytic markers (CD13 and CD64). These results demonstrate that the proliferation of some leukemic cells may be inhibited by micromolar concentrations of sex steroids, independently of nuclear receptor expression. The main mechanism seems to be a block in cell cycle associated with modulation of apoptosis and differentiation. It provided additional evidence for the potential value of sex steroids and their analogues in the treatment of leukemias.","['Mossuz, P', 'Cousin, F', 'Castinel, A', 'Chauvet, M', 'Sotto, M F', 'Polack, B', 'Sotto, J J', 'Kolodie, L']","['Mossuz P', 'Cousin F', 'Castinel A', 'Chauvet M', 'Sotto MF', 'Polack B', 'Sotto JJ', 'Kolodie L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Grenoble, France. pascal.mossuz@ujf-grenoble.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Testosterone/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(98)00101-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00101-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Nov;22(11):1063-72. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00101-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that expression of MDR would thereby block the cytotoxicity induced by the SLs sphingosine, sphinganine and N-hexanoyl-sphingosine. An MDR-expressing subline of murine P388 leukemia cells demonstrated an ED50 value > or = 2 log10 higher than the parental line in response to doxorubicin. In contrast, the ED50 values for each of the SLs were only approximately 1.5 to two-fold higher in the MDR line than in the parental; induction of DNA damage by SLs was comparable or actually greater in MDR compared to parental cells. Therefore, expression of MDR does not significantly affect the cytotoxic function of these SLs, nor do these SLs likely contribute to MDR.","['Klostergaard, J', 'Auzenne, E', 'Leroux, E']","['Klostergaard J', 'Auzenne E', 'Leroux E']","['Department of Tumor Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', '*Apoptosis', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Sphingolipids/*pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(98)00107-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00107-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Nov;22(11):1049-56. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00107-6.,,['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analyses of CD34+ cells enriched from BM showed that most of the sialosyl-I cells expressed CD13, CD33, CD117, and HLA-DR. Sialosyl-I+ CD34+ cells isolated from BM produced a large number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies and macrophage colonies. Therefore, sialosyl-I+ CD34+ cells are suggested to be colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and colony-forming units macrophage (CFU-M).

However, there is good evidence supporting the involvement of RAS signalling pathway in CML and this could be due to alterations in RAS activity regulatory proteins. The neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene down-regulates the RAS signal transduction pathway through the inhibitory function of its GAP-related domain (GRD) on RAS protein. The loss or alteration of neurofibromin (the NF1 protein) may produce a disfunction similar to point mutations in the RAS gene resulting in the permanent stimulation of the RAS signal transduction pathway. Mutations involving the GRD region of the NF1 gene (GRD-NF1) have been described in a variety of tumors such as colon carcinoma and astrocytoma. Germline mutations and deletions in the NF1 gene, as seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, are also associated with certain myeloid disorders. In the present work, we sought to identify mutations in the codons 12/13 and 61 of RAS gene and in the Lys-1423 codon of GRD-NF1, which are well known hot spots in these genes, in a group of 36 adults and ten children with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase and blast crisis. Using the PCR-SSCP and the allele-specific restriction assay (ASRA) techniques, we were not able to observe any RAS or NF1 detectable mutation.

One possible approach to reducing the relapse rate is to intensify pre-transplant conditioning. Thiotepa (TTP) is an alkylating agent that has been used mainly in breast and ovarian cancer with 20-50% response rates. This report presents our results on 33 patients with acute leukemia (acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) 27 patients, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) six patients) who underwent ABMT following conditioning with busulfan (BU), 4 mg/kg x 4 days (days -8 to -5), TTP 5 mg/kg x 2 days (days -4, -3) and cyclophosphamide (CY) 60 mg/kg x 2 days (days -2, -1).

Twenty-eight patients were transplanted in complete remission (AML 26; ALL 2) while 5 (AML 1; ALL 4) were in early relapse. Twenty-nine additional AML patients (15 females, 14 males) of median age 22 (2-48) years, who underwent ABMT following a standard BU-CY conditioning regimen (25 in complete remission and four in relapse) served as historical controls. There were no significant differences between the study and control groups with respect to patient age, sex, diagnosis, stage of disease, FAB classification, and prior chemotherapy, at ABMT. Overall survival, disease free survival (DFS), and relapse rate at 72 months were 33, 33 and 61%, respectively, for the study group, and 38, 34.5 and 52%, respectively, for the historical controls.

This decision may depend on which type of donor is available: an HLA-identical sibling, an alternative donor transplant (HLA-matched related or unrelated people other than HLA-identical siblings), or autotransplant. OBJECTIVE: To determine the appropriate use of high-dose therapy and bone marrow transplants in ALL in first remission. Develop a treatment algorithm. PANELISTS: Nine leukemia experts from diverse geographic sites and practice settings. EVIDENCE: Boolean MEDLINE searches of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chemotherapy and/or transplants. CONSENSUS PROCESS: We used a modified Delphi-panel group judgment process. Age, white blood cell (WBC) count, cytogenetics and immune type were permuted to define 48 clinical settings. Each panelist rated appropriateness of high-dose therapy and a transplant versus conventional-dose chemotherapy on a 9-point ordinal scale (1, most inappropriate; 9, most appropriate) considering three types of donors: (1) HLA-identical siblings; (2) alternative donors; and (3) autotransplants. An appropriateness index was developed based on median rating and amount of disagreement. Relationship of appropriateness indices to the permuted clinical variables was considered by analysis of variance and recursive partitioning. Preference between donor types was analyzed by comparing mean appropriateness indices of comparable settings and a treatment algorithm was developed. CONCLUSIONS: In people with an HLA-identical sibling donor, transplants were rated appropriate in those with unfavorable cytogenetics and uncertain in all other settings. An HLA-identical sibling donor was always preferred to an alternative donor or autotransplant.

Exposure of cells to bryostatin 1 (10 nM; 15 hr) after (but not before) a 6-hr incubation with 0.5 microM taxol significantly increased apoptosis and resulted in an approximately 3 log reduction in clonogenicity. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the increase in apoptotic cells following bryostatin 1 treatment occurred primarily in the population undergoing taxol-mediated G2M arrest. The actions of bryostatin 1 were not attributable to potentiation of taxol-induced tubulin stabilization or to a reduction in the intracellular retention of taxol. Following exposure of cells to taxol, the Bcl-2 protein displayed an alteration in mobility that was not modified appreciably by bryostatin 1 treatment. The mobility shift in Bcl-2 protein from cells exposed to taxol followed by bryostatin 1 was eliminated by treatment of lysates with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); the latter effect was blocked by okadaic acid. Treatment of cells with taxol followed by bryostatin 1 did not increase the amount of total Bax (compared with treatment with taxol alone), but did increase the amount of free Bax in the supernatant fraction. Finally, the ability of bryostatin 1 to potentiate taxol-induced apoptosis in U937 cells was mimicked closely by 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059), a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK). Collectively, these findings indicate that bryostatin 1 increases the susceptibility of U937 cells to taxol-induced apoptosis and inhibition of clonogenicity. They also raise the possibility that this phenomenon may involve functional alterations in Bcl-2 and/or other proteins involved in regulation of the cell death pathway.","['Wang, S', 'Guo, C Y', 'Castillo, A', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Wang S', 'Guo CY', 'Castillo A', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00188-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00188-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Sep 1;56(5):635-44. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00188-9.,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 66990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte (G)-CSF and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, stimulate proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitors and have been effective in reducing neutropenia and its complications. The primary use of CSFs in patients receiving chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer has resulted in a reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia, a decrease in the duration of grade IV neutropenia, and a reduction in hospitalization time and antibiotic use. Although CSF use allows for higher dose intensity, a survival benefit has not been proven. The use of CSFs after the occurrence of neutropenic fever decreases the duration of grade IV neutropenia, but effects on hospitalization and antibiotic use are less well-defined. The therapeutic use of CSFs in the setting of established neutropenia, regardless of the presence or absence of fever, is not supported in the literature. The administration of CSFs to patients with acute myeloid leukemia is safe in that no trial has demonstrated evidence of leukemic stimulation with these drugs. As in other settings, the duration of neutropenia is shortened if CSFs are used postchemotherapy with evidence of clinical benefit. CSFs also decrease chemotherapeutic toxicity via other mechanisms. The use of G-CSF reduces the incidence of mucositis, in normal donors enhances the yield of leukapheresis for granulocyte transfusion, and is beneficial in the autologous transplant setting. These effects of CSFs in mitigating chemotherapeutic toxicity are reviewed.","['Johnston, E M', 'Crawford, J']","['Johnston EM', 'Crawford J']","['Duke University Medical School, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/*prevention & control']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1998 Oct;25(5):552-61.,,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell culture models of mineralization have often been used to study the cellular mechanisms of mineralization, but few data have been reported concerning the influence of extracellular matrix components and cytokines on the physicochemical properties of mineral. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of two cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM), involved in bone metabolism on the physicochemical properties of bone mineral formed in a murine in vivo mineralization model. Murine bone marrow cells implanted under the kidney capsule in the presence or absence of cytokines led to heterotopic ossicle formation. A scanning electron microscopic microprobe revealed that heterotopic calcification had a lower (approximately 20%) Ca/P ratio after cytokine treatment as compared with the control without cytokine. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of cytokine-treated ossicles showed numerous areas with low mineral density, whereas electron diffraction pattern revealed an apatitic phase. These areas were not observed in the absence of cytokine. Moreover, Fourier transform-infrared microspectroscopy showed at the molecular level that the presence of either cytokine induced many microscopic areas in which short-range order organization, such as incorporation of carbonate and crystallinity/maturity of ossicle mineral, were modified. LIF and OSM influenced mineral phase formation in the present model and may thus be key protagonists in bone mineral development and skeletal diseases.","['Bohic, S', 'Rohanizadeh, R', 'Touchais, S', 'Godard, A', 'Daculsi, G', 'Heymann, D']","['Bohic S', 'Rohanizadeh R', 'Touchais S', 'Godard A', 'Daculsi G', 'Heymann D']","['UPRES EA 2159, Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire sur les Tissus Calcifies et les Biomateriaux, Faculte de Chirurgie Dentaire, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Minerals)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Calcinosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kidney/chemistry/diagnostic imaging/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microchemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Minerals/*metabolism', 'Nephrocalcinosis/pathology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Radiography', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Transplantation, Heterotopic']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.10.1619 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 Oct;13(10):1619-32. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.10.1619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Semi-quantitative analysis of HCV RNA indicated that HCV replicated in these cloned PH5CH cells was released into the culture medium. Semi-quantitative analysis of internalized HCV RNA after treatment of cloned PH5CH cells and parental PH5CH cells with proteinase K immediately after virus inoculation revealed that PH5CH1, PH5CH7 and PH5CH8 cells contained 10-fold higher levels of HCV RNA than low susceptible cloned PH5CH or parental PH5CH cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HCV replication was maintained for 70-100 days in these three clonal lines when the temperature of cell culture after virus inoculation was reduced from 37 to 32 degrees C.

According to the results, more patients in group A than group B were younger than 1 year old and had profound neutropenia; fewer patients in group A than group B had an endovascular catheter, a higher frequency of manifest clinical site of infection at admission, and a prevalence of isolation of gram-negative bacilli. A higher percentage of patients in group B had neutropenia of more than 14 days, gram-positive cocci in culture, and lower mortality. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression in 340 patients revealed that the presence of a severe noninfectious complication, severe neutropenia, and positive blood culture correlated with high mortality rate (p < or = 0.001).","['Paganini, H', 'Bologna, R', 'Debbag, R', 'Casimir, L', 'Gomez, S', 'Rosanova, M', 'Scopinaro, M']","['Paganini H', 'Bologna R', 'Debbag R', 'Casimir L', 'Gomez S', 'Rosanova M', 'Scopinaro M']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital de Pediatria, Buenos Aires, Argentina. hpaganini@intramed.net.ar']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Argentina', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019809016568 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Sep-Oct;15(5):405-13. doi: 10.3109/08880019809016568.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is difficult to assess nutritional status on a daily basis because an accurate quantitation of the calorie intake is difficult. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters are prone to error and often reflect past rather than current nutritional status. In practice, a subjective clinical assessment is usually relied upon. This study objectively appraises the value of such an assessment. Based on clinical symptoms that alter oral intake and absorption of food, a scoring system was designed to assess nutritional status on a day to day basis. A symptom score (SS) of 10 implied ""normality""; 0 indicated maximum debility. Over a 2-year period 511 daily scores were recorded in 30 patients aged 0.7-17.5 years. Patients were studied at presentation and during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 14; solid tumors receiving megatherapy with autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR, n = 8), and chemotherapy for different tumors (miscellaneous, n = 8). The SS was compared with other nutritional parameters, including sequential anthropometric indices, serum albumin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and whole-body protein turnover (WBPT) using [1-(13) C]leucine. The mean SS was reduced at diagnosis for all leukemic patients (median score = 8), improved during first remission (p < 0.002), fell to a minimum during febrile neutropenia (p = 0.0009), and improved with clinical and hematological recovery (p = 0.0009). A reduction in SS was related to fever (p < 0.001) and a fall in neutrophil count (p < 0.001). There was no correlation with anthropometric indices or IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels. Paired WBPT studies in 9 patients showed that SS correlated well with protein breakdown (p = 0.026). The results suggest that the ongoing nutritional status of children with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy is best assessed using simple clinical parameters.","['Attard-Montalto, S P', 'Hadley, J', 'Kingston, J E', 'Eden, O B', 'Saha, V']","['Attard-Montalto SP', 'Hadley J', 'Kingston JE', 'Eden OB', 'Saha V']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Proteins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', '*Nutritional Status', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteins/metabolism']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019809016567 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Sep-Oct;15(5):393-403. doi: 10.3109/08880019809016567.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased bone marrow fibrosis was seen in about half of the available trephines, mainly in RAEB patients. Median survival of patients was ten months with a follow up duration of 2-55 months. Four patients transformed to acute leukemia (M1 or M2) and died subsequently. However, infection was major complication and cause of death (10 cases). The preponderance of younger people to acquire the disease (especially the RAEB and RAEBt variants), the emergence of RAEB as the major group of MDS and increased prevalence of hypoplastic MDS point towards non-therapeutic genotoxin (s) in the causation of disease.

Cells upregulated by a primary dose of heat formed giant colonies and had an altered response to a second dose of heat. Thermosensitivity depended upon the time elapsed between heat treatments. Heating the cells at either 42 degrees or 42.5 degrees C yielded biphasic survival curves, indicating a mixed population of productively infected and quiescent cells. Hyperthermia at 43 degrees C abolished this effect. Thermal sensitivity of infected cells was correlated with the expression of a viral reporter protein. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a membrane active drug potentiated the heat effect in both uninfected and virally infected cells. The drug also abolished the biphasic effect of heat in infected cells, suggesting that heat sensitivity of both productively and quiescent cells is membrane mediated. The combined effect of heat at 42.5 degrees C and CPZ was equivalent to the effect of heat alone at 43.5 degrees C. These observations indicate that heat can selectively be lethal to productively infected cells and the membrane active drugs could further amplify this hyperthermic effect.","['Shenoy, M A', 'Yatvin']","['Shenoy MA', 'Yatvin']","['Radiation & Thermal Biology Division, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",India,Indian J Exp Biol,Indian journal of experimental biology,0233411,['U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Chlorpromazine/*therapeutic use', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy']",1998/10/23 00:00,1998/10/23 00:01,['1998/10/23 00:00'],"['1998/10/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Exp Biol. 1998 Jul;36(7):668-74.,,['R01 CA49416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this is mind the authors explored the addition of a 120-hour continuous infusion of paclitaxel to a previously reported regimen comprised of high dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa. METHODS: Thirty-one women with advanced breast carcinoma (30 patients with Stage IV disease and 1 patient with Stage IIIB disease) underwent harvest and cryopreservation of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood progenitor cells. High dose cyclophosphamide (2.5 g/m2) and thiotepa (225 mg/m2) were administered intravenously on Days -7, -5, and -3. Paclitaxel was administered as a 120-hour continuous infusion starting on Day -7. RESULTS: Three patients were treated at the initial cohort dose of 50 mg/m2 (over 120 hours), 6 patients at 100 mg/m2, 6 patients at 125 mg/m2, 6 patients at 150 mg/m2, 6 patients at 180 mg/m2, and 4 patients at 210 mg/m2. All patients completed the treatment protocol as planned with no associated transplant-related deaths. Mucositis as evidenced by either stomatitis or noninfectious diarrhea was experienced by all patients and was determined to be the dose-limiting toxicity at the 210 mg/m2 dose level. One patient with dose-limiting mucositis required intubation for airway protection and also experienced Grade 3 (according to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B common toxicity grading scale) pulmonary and neurologic toxicity. Only one Grade 3 toxicity was encountered below the maximum tolerated dose in a patient who developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage at a dose of 125 mg/m2. No allergic reactions or clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathies were encountered. Cardiac, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal. Response rates in this previously treated patient population were difficult to assess in light of the high incidence of bone metastases; an overall response rate of 24% was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel at a dose of 180 mg/m2 as a 120-hour continuous infusion may be added safely to high dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa with autologous stem cell rescue. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and further define the toxicity of this recommended Phase II dose.","['Zimmerman, T M', 'Grinblatt, D L', 'Malloy, R', 'Williams, S F']","['Zimmerman TM', 'Grinblatt DL', 'Malloy R', 'Williams SF']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Esophagitis/chemically induced', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/drug effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiotepa/*administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/10/22 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/22 02:03'],"['1998/10/22 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/22 02:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981015)83:8<1540::AID-CNCR8>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Oct 15;83(8):1540-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the literature, 37 well-documented cases have been reported. METHODS: The authors report 7 patients with extramedullary APL documented by cytologic, phenotypic, and molecular analyses among 120 adult APL patients referred to two different institutions during a period of 9 years. RESULTS: In this APL series, extramedullary disease (EMD) occurred in 7 of 120 cases (5.8%). The extramedullary sites were the skin in five patients, the central nervous system in one, and the lymph nodes in one. Molecular analysis of the PML/RARalpha rearrangement was performed on four samples of skin and one of CSF; all patients exhibited the same molecular pattern in the bone marrow (BM) and EMD sites. Of 120 patients, 61 were treated with ATRA plus chemotherapy and 59 with chemotherapy alone. Relapses were observed in 38 patients, 6 of whom had EMD; 1 patient had developed EMD at the onset of APL. Of the relapsed EMD cases, 2 of 61 patients had received ATRA plus chemotherapy and 4 of 59 had received chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: There is some controversy as to whether treatment of APL with ATRA may predispose patients to the development of extramedullary relapse. The data from this study do not contain evidence that EMD may occur more frequently in APL patients treated with ATRA.","['Liso, V', 'Specchia, G', 'Pogliani, E M', 'Palumbo, G', 'Mininni, D', 'Rossi, V', 'Teruzzi, E', 'Mestice, A', 'Coppi, M R', 'Biondi, A']","['Liso V', 'Specchia G', 'Pogliani EM', 'Palumbo G', 'Mininni D', 'Rossi V', 'Teruzzi E', 'Mestice A', 'Coppi MR', 'Biondi A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Universita di Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1998/10/22 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/22 02:03'],"['1998/10/22 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/22 02:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981015)83:8<1522::AID-CNCR6>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Oct 15;83(8):1522-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we synthesized several ARQ alkyl ethers and studied their cytotoxic activity against mouse leukemia P388 cells. The dissociation constant was also similar among the ARQ monoalkyl ethers. There was a good correlation between the hydrophobicity of ARQ monoalkyl ethers estimated by high performance liquid chromatography and the intracellular content accumulated for 60 min. ARQ monoalkyl ethers were cytotoxic, but ARQ dimethyl ether was not, as previously reported. The cytotoxicity of the ARQ monoalkyl ether derivatives was increased with extension of the alkyl chain length. The cytotoxicity was closely correlated with the intracellular content. The strongest ARQ derivative, ARQ monohexyl ether (ARQHex), formed more DNA-interstrand cross-links in the cells than ARQ. After treatment of P388 cells with ARQ and ARQHex for 6 h, a nucleosomal ladder pattern, as well as the appearance of degraded DNA, observed by flow cytometry, indicated that these compounds caused cellular apoptosis. Moreover, ARQ and ARQHex accumulated in the cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These results indicated that ARQ monoalkyl ethers increased cytotoxicity, according to their membrane permeability based on the hydrophobicity, and they caused apoptotic cell death, as did ARQ.","['Kaji, A', 'Saito, R', 'Nomura, M', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Kiriyama, N']","['Kaji A', 'Saito R', 'Nomura M', 'Miyamoto K', 'Kiriyama N']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokuriku University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Indoles)', '60696-52-8 (asterriquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aspergillus/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ethers/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Indoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.21.945 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1998 Sep;21(9):945-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.21.945.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there have been many attempts to neutralize the activity of cytokines in vivo and in vitro, no strategies have been developed to specifically eliminate cells that overexpress cytokines. Considering the fact that cytokines in part remain cell associated on secretion, we have constructed a bispecific diabody consisting of a nonneutralizing scFv antibody recognizing human interleukin-6 (IL-6) and an scFv corresponding to the monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKT3, which recognizes and activates the human T cell receptor. Here we show that the diabody recognized both human IL-6 and human CD3. In the presence of human T cells, the diabody induced killing of human hepatoma cells that had been transfected with a human IL-6 cDNA. The extent of killing was dependent on the ratio of effector/target cells and increased with increasing concentrations of the diabody. Untransfected control cells or human hepatoma cells that secrete the IL-6-related cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) remained unaffected. We conclude that diabodies recognizing cytokines can be used to specifically target cytokine-secreting cells.","['Krebs, B', 'Ackermann, B', 'Rose-John, S']","['Krebs B', 'Ackermann B', 'Rose-John S']","['Department of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1998.18.783 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998 Sep;18(9):783-91. doi: 10.1089/jir.1998.18.783.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have undertaken experiments to try to dissociate GVL from GVHD. Transfer of immune spleen cells induced a greater GVL than transfer of normal spleen cells with an equivalent to GVHD. Three to five million immune or normal CD8+ T lymphocytes were sufficient to induce both GVL and GVHD. Individual DBA/2 mice were labeled and followed. In mice undergoing GVHD, the spleens were repopulated by donor (H-2b) lymphocytes, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were present in the sera of 26 of 27 and 18 of 20 mice, respectively, together with increased amounts of TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA in their spleens.

Because of this, there is speculation that these two lymphomas may have a common origin, both arising from the mantle zone of the lymph node. CD44 (HCAM), a glycoprotein ""homing receptor,"" has been reported as a marker of small B-cell lymphomas for determining behavior as well as the nodal cell of origin. Intensity of CD44 expression also has been correlated with dissemination of lymphoma. We studied 50 cases with classic features of SLL (30 cases) or MCL (20 cases). Immunophenotypic analysis was performed on paraffin sections. All cases of MCL and SLL were CD20 positive; CD5 was expressed in 19 of 25 (76%) SLL and 11 of 15 (73%) MCL. Cyclin D1 was expressed in 11 of 17 (76%) MCL and no cases of SLL. CD43 coexpression was seen in 27 of 29 (93%) SLL and 17 of 19 (89%) MCL. CD23 was positive in 25 of 28 (89%) SLL and 2 of 20 (10%) MCL. Bcl-2 was positive in 18 of 22 (82%) SLL and 15 of 16 (94%) MCL. CD44 was positive with moderate to strong intensity in 11 of 30 SLL and 15 of 20 MCL. Peripheral blood involvement did not correlate with CD44 immunoreactivity. MCL tended to have intense CD44 immunoreactivity, whereas SLL tended to show weaker CD44 intensity. This trend in the intensity of CD44 in MCL suggests that CD44 may be helpful in distinguishing SLL from MCL and possibly elucidating the origin of these CD5-positive B-cell neoplasms.","['Aguilera, N S', 'Chu, W S', 'Andriko, J A', 'Abbondanzo, S L']","['Aguilera NS', 'Chu WS', 'Andriko JA', 'Abbondanzo SL']","['Department of Hematologic and Lymphatic Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(98)90426-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(98)90426-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1998 Oct;29(10):1134-9. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(98)90426-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ANIMALS: 4 adult cats seronegative for FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus. PROCEDURE: Cats were infected with H felis by i.v. administration of 1 ml of blood obtained from an infected cat. Rectal temperature, PCV, and microscopic examination of blood smears for organisms were monitored daily. At peak of infection, doxycycline treatment was initiated for 21 days. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals. Six months after treatment, 2 cats were given methylprednisolone (14 mg/kg of body weight, i.m.). Daily blood samples were collected for CBC, detection of organisms, and PCR evaluation. On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of H felis, specific PCR primers were created for a 393-basepair internal fragment. RESULTS: The 393-basepair product was consistently amplified from blood samples obtained during peak parasitemia but not during the last week of or immediately after completion of doxycycline treatment. After treatment, PCV returned to the reference range, and organisms were not observed in blood samples; however, the PCR product could be consistently amplified. After administration of methylprednisolone, organisms were only rarely observed in blood smears but were consistently detected by PCR analysis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Using PCR analysis, it was possible to detect H felis in blood samples obtained from cats during peak parasitemia, during most of the carrier phase, and after challenge with immunosuppressive drugs. During and immediately after antibiotic treatment, this test may fail to detect the organisms.","['Berent, L M', 'Messick, J B', 'Cooper, S K']","['Berent LM', 'Messick JB', 'Cooper SK']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana 61802, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anaplasmataceae/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Anaplasmataceae Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/diagnosis/drug therapy/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Carrier State/diagnosis/drug therapy/veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Chronic Disease', 'Doxycycline/therapeutic use', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 1998 Oct;59(10):1215-20.,['GENBANK/L24488'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prevent graft failure, large doses of T-cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cells were transplanted after a conditioning regimen of enhanced myeloablation and immunosuppression was administered to the recipient. METHODS: Forty-three patients with high-risk acute leukemia who were scheduled for transplantation received total-body irradiation, thiotepa, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. The graft consisted of peripheral-blood progenitor cells that had been mobilized in the donor with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and also, in 28 cases, bone marrow. Bone marrow from the donor was depleted of T lymphocytes by processing with soybean agglutinin and E-rosetting. T-cell depletion of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was achieved by E-rosetting followed by positive selection of CD34+ cells. No post-transplantation prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was administered. RESULTS: In all the patients, full donor-type engraftment was achieved. In none of the patients who could be evaluated did acute or chronic GVHD develop. Regimen-related toxicity was minimal. Eleven of the 23 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had a relapse, as did 2 of the 20 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Transplantation-related mortality was 40 percent. After a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 8 to 30), 12 of the 43 patients were alive and free of disease. All surviving patients had a good quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The main limitations of transplantation of bone marrow from donors who are matched with the recipient for only one HLA haplotype GVHD and graft failure - can be overcome. Since most patients have a relative with one haplotype mismatch, advances in this method will increase the availability of hematopoietic-cell transplantation as curative therapy for acute leukemia.","['Aversa, F', 'Tabilio, A', 'Velardi, A', 'Cunningham, I', 'Terenzi, A', 'Falzetti, F', 'Ruggeri, L', 'Barbabietola, G', 'Aristei, C', 'Latini, P', 'Reisner, Y', 'Martelli, M F']","['Aversa F', 'Tabilio A', 'Velardi A', 'Cunningham I', 'Terenzi A', 'Falzetti F', 'Ruggeri L', 'Barbabietola G', 'Aristei C', 'Latini P', 'Reisner Y', 'Martelli MF']","['Department of Internal and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199810223391702 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Oct 22;339(17):1186-93. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199810223391702.,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1998 Oct 22;339(17):1238-9.

Japan Marrow Donor Program.,1177-85,"BACKGROUND: The requirements with respect to HLA compatibility and the relative importance of matching for individual class I and class II HLA alleles in the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated donors have not yet been established. METHODS: We performed retrospective DNA typing of alleles at 11 polymorphic loci of HLA genes in 440 recipients of hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated donors who were serologically identical with their respective recipients for HLA-A, B, and DR antigens. Of these recipients, 80 percent had leukemia; the rest had lymphoma, marrow failure, or a congenital disorder. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that incompatibility for HLA-A alleles and incompatibility for HLA-C alleles were independent risk factors for severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (HLA-A, P=0.006; HLA-C, P=0.001). Mismatching of HLA-A, but not of HLA-C, alleles was an independent risk factor for death (P<0.001). Matching [corrected] of HLA-C alleles was a significant risk factor for relapse of leukemia (P=0.035). HLA-B disparity was a significant risk factor for both GVHD and death in the univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Disparities in class II HLA alleles of the DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1 loci were not identified as significant risk factors for acute GVHD or death in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic typing of class I HLA alleles adds substantially to the success of transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from unrelated donors, even if the donors are serologically identical to their recipients with respect to HLA-A, B, and DR antigens.","['Sasazuki, T', 'Juji, T', 'Morishima, Y', 'Kinukawa, N', 'Kashiwabara, H', 'Inoko, H', 'Yoshida, T', 'Kimura, A', 'Akaza, T', 'Kamikawaji, N', 'Kodera, Y', 'Takaku, F']","['Sasazuki T', 'Juji T', 'Morishima Y', 'Kinukawa N', 'Kashiwabara H', 'Inoko H', 'Yoshida T', 'Kimura A', 'Akaza T', 'Kamikawaji N', 'Kodera Y', 'Takaku F']","['Department of Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199810223391701 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Oct 22;339(17):1177-85. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199810223391701.,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1998 Oct 22;339(17):1238-9.

The present study examined a number of peptide growth factors and regulatory molecules that are present within the uterine environment at early pregnancy, coincident with maximal SSAT gene expression, for their ability to manifest endogenous SSAT gene-inducing activity. Basal SSAT expression in luminal epithelial cells was higher (p < 0. 01) than that for glandular epithelial (GE) or stromal (ST) cells. Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 50 ng/ml) had no effect on steady-state SSAT mRNA levels, but it increased mitogenesis in all three cell types. In contrast, IGF-I caused a marked induction (p < 0.01) of SSAT mRNA levels in the human endometrial carcinoma cell line Hec-1-A. Uterine explants incubated with interleukin-6, transforming growth factor alpha, epidermal growth factor (each at 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml), retinoic acid and retinol (each at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 microM), and estradiol-17beta (10 nM) had SSAT mRNA levels similar to controls. By contrast, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; at 10 and 100 ng/ml) caused a modest, but significant (p < 0.05), increase in SSAT mRNA levels over those of untreated explants. This effect of LIF, however, did not approach the level of induction observed in GE or ST cells after addition of medium conditioned by Day 12 or 17 porcine conceptuses and in endometrial explants supplemented with medium conditioned by Day 21 porcine conceptuses or a continuous cell line (Jag-1) derived from Day 14 porcine trophoblast. We suggest that transient induction of endometrial SSAT gene expression at implantation is mediated by the functional interactions of specific conceptus-derived regulatory factors, distinct from estrogen, with endometrial-derived factor(s) such as LIF. These complex interactions are probably requisite for the transient, yet dramatic, induction of SSAT gene expression and may be critical for successful implantation.","['Green, M L', 'Chung, T E', 'Reed, K L', 'Modric, T', 'Badinga, L', 'Yang, J', 'Simmen, F A', 'Simmen, R C']","['Green ML', 'Chung TE', 'Reed KL', 'Modric T', 'Badinga L', 'Yang J', 'Simmen FA', 'Simmen RC']","['Department of Animal Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/*enzymology', 'Epithelial Cells/enzymology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', '*Swine', 'Uterus/*enzymology']",1998/10/22 00:00,1998/10/22 00:01,['1998/10/22 00:00'],"['1998/10/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod59.5.1251 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1998 Nov;59(5):1251-8. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod59.5.1251.,,['HD21961/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During prolonged treatment with zanamivir, a mutant virus was isolated from an immunocompromised child infected with influenza B virus. A hemagglutinin mutation (198 Thr-->Ile) reduced the virus affinity for receptors found on susceptible human cells. A mutation in the neuraminidase active site (152 Arg-->Lys) led to a 1000-fold reduction in the enzyme sensitivity to zanamivir. When tested in ferrets, the mutant virus had less virulence than the parent; however, it had a growth preference over the parent in zanamivir-treated animals. Despite these changes, the sensitivity of the mutant virus to zanamivir assessed by a standard test in MDCK cells was unaffected.

To examine the mechanism of Syk regulation, the two tyrosine residues at 519 and 520 in the putative activation loop of rat Syk were mutated to phenylalanine either singly or in combination. The various mutants were expressed in a Syk-negative variant of the RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia 2H3) mast cell line. In these transfected cell lines, mutant Syk did show increased tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo and increased enzymatic activity in vitro after Fc epsilonRI aggregation. There were conformational changes detected by an Ab when the wild-type and mutant Syk were either tyrosine phosphorylated or bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif peptides. However, these mutant Syk were incapable of transducing Fc epsilonRI signaling. In cells in which the expression level of mutant Syk was similar to that of the wild-type Syk, Fc epsilonRI cross-linking induced no increase in cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase, and no histamine release.

This chimera also suppressed cytoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization in the presence and absence of calcium ion in the extracellular medium. Tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutations at the third and fourth immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-like sequences of PIR-B attenuated the inhibitory effects on degranulation and on cytoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization, indicating the important role of these tyrosines for the delivery of negative signal. In contrast, the cross-linking of another chimeric receptor composed of the type IIB receptor for IgG extracellular portion and the transmembrane and short cytoplasmic sequence of PIR-A elicited Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation.

Although pharmacokinetic variability has been shown to influence the efficacy of ALL chemotherapy, the usefulness of conventional pharmacokinetic measures to predict responses to individual chemotherapeutic agents can be confounded in the context of multiagent chemotherapy. This has led to the concomitant use of pharmacodynamic endpoints to identify patients who exhibit a poor initial response to therapy or whose residual disease has a persistence that predicts a poor prognosis unless therapy is changed. To this end, the initial reduction of leukemia cells in peripheral blood or in bone marrow and the detection of minimal residual disease by immunologic or polymerase chain reaction-based methods have shown promise as pharmacodynamic endpoints to identify patients who are at high risk for relapse if therapy remains unchanged.

To test for a transformation inhibitory effect of this oligomerization inhibitory peptide transcription unit on the p210bcr-abl mediated IL3 independent growth of the P210bcrabl32D cell line, we transiently co-electroporated into the growth factor dependent 32D cells, mixtures of plasmids which contained varying ratios of the plasmid expression vectors for the bcr oligomerization inhibitory peptide along with a smaller amount of the plasmid expression vector for the full length p210bcr-abl.

Nineteen patients (32%) achieved a complete response (CR); seven had hematologic improvement. CRs were observed in 11 of 30 patients with MDS (37%) and eight of 30 patients with CMML (27%). Conversion to diploid karyotype was observed in eight patients with karyotypic abnormalities at diagnosis who later achieved a CR. History of prior chemotherapy and monocytosis was associated with poor prognosis. Mutation of the RAS oncogene was found in six CMML patients (20%), and none responded to topotecan therapy. The estimated 12-month survival rate was 33%, the median survival time was 9.3 months, and the median remission duration was 7 months. The most significant toxicities were gastrointestinal, including mucositis (67%; severe 23%) and diarrhea (38%; severe 17%). Febrile episodes were noted in 85% of the patients, while documented infection occurred in 47%.

This study examined the risk of s-AML following cumulative etoposide doses greater than 2 g/m2 in patients with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of s-AML was retrospectively assessed in patients treated within clinical trials between January 1986 and February 1996 at four university centers. All patients received high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) plus autologous stem-cell support for metastatic GCT, including high cumulative etoposide doses (> 2 g/m2). Minimum patient follow-up was 12 months. Standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) was calculated to estimate the risk associated with high cumulative etoposide doses, as compared with the general population. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients with a median age of 29 years (range, 15 to 55) received a median cumulative etoposide dose of 5 g/m2 (range, 2.4 to 14 g/m2). Four cases of s-AML were observed, which resulted in a cumulative incidence of 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38% to 3.59%) at 52 months of median follow-up (range, 12 to 198). Two cases of secondary myelodysplasia (s-MDS) developed in patients with primary mediastinal GCT. Based on the observed four cases of AML, which are most likely etoposide-related, the risk for developing s-AML (SMR, 160 [95% CI, 43.7 to 411.2]) is significantly increased in comparison to the age-matched general population. CONCLUSION: Due to the low incidence of AML in the general population, the significantly elevated risk for developing s-AML affects only 1.3% of all patients who receive etoposide doses greater than 2 g/m2. HDCT, including etoposide doses greater than 2 g/m2, is associated with an acceptably low incidence of s-AML in patients with advanced GCT.","['Kollmannsberger, C', 'Beyer, J', 'Droz, J P', 'Harstrick, A', 'Hartmann, J T', 'Biron, P', 'Flechon, A', 'Schoffski, P', 'Kuczyk, M', 'Schmoll, H J', 'Kanz, L', 'Bokemeyer, C']","['Kollmannsberger C', 'Beyer J', 'Droz JP', 'Harstrick A', 'Hartmann JT', 'Biron P', 'Flechon A', 'Schoffski P', 'Kuczyk M', 'Schmoll HJ', 'Kanz L', 'Bokemeyer C']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Tuebingen Medical Center, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1998/10/21 00:00,1998/10/21 00:01,['1998/10/21 00:00'],"['1998/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.10.3386 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Oct;16(10):3386-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.10.3386.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial of topotecan, given on a daily bolus schedule in combination with cisplatin, produced more hematologic toxicity than expected with either drug alone. Therefore, we designed this phase I trial to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the recommended phase II doses of cisplatin in combination with topotecan administered as a CIVI. Population pharmacodynamic models for the combination also were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors and a maximum of one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease were eligible if they had a performance status of 0 to 1 and adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function. Prior treatment with camptothecins or platinum compounds and prior pelvic irradiation were not allowed. The initial schedule consisted of a fixed dose of topotecan 0.4 mg/m2/d administered as a CIVI for 21 days and escalating doses of cisplatin administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day schedule, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was achieved. After severe hematologic toxicity was observed in the first two patients, the topotecan infusion was shortened to 14 days, and the total dose of cisplatin was administered on day 1 in all subsequent patients. After the MTD was defined, that cohort was expanded to include a total of 12 assessable patients. Hematopoietic growth factors were not allowed. For the pharmacologic studies, total topotecan plasma concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) during infusion on days 3, 8, and 11 on the first cycle, and the median steady-state concentration (Tss) was determined. Platinum plasma concentrations on day 3 were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients enrolled, 28 were assessable for toxicity and 24 for response. The primary toxicity was hematologic, with both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia being dose-limiting. The MTD of cisplatin was 75 mg/m2 on day 1 in combination with topotecan 0.4 mg/m2/d for 14 days. At this dose level, three of a total of 12 assessable patients had DLT. The pharmacodynamic relationship between Tss and the absolute neutrophil count at the nadir (ANCn) was described by the following equation: log10 (ANCn)=4.23 - 0.47 x Tss - 0.01 x cisplatin dose (P < .0001; R2=0.64). The substitution of platinum concentration for cisplatin dose in this model did not result in a significant improvement. Three patients had a partial response: one with duodenal carcinoma; a second with small-cell lung cancer; and a third with melanoma. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin can be given safely in combination with CIVI topotecan. However, toxicity was still substantial. Based on the current results and our previous trial of this combination, we conclude that, when combined with cisplatin, CIVI topotecan does not seem to be advantageous compared with the more traditional daily bolus schedule.","['Lilenbaum, R C', 'Miller, A A', 'Batist, G', 'Bernard, S', 'Hollis, D R', 'Rosner, G L', 'Egorin, M J', 'Schilsky, R L', 'Ratain, M J']","['Lilenbaum RC', 'Miller AA', 'Batist G', 'Bernard S', 'Hollis DR', 'Rosner GL', 'Egorin MJ', 'Schilsky RL', 'Ratain MJ']","['Mt.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety patients with CML and cytogenetic clonal evolution who received IFN-alpha-based regimens were analyzed. Clonal evolution was defined as the presence of karyotypic abnormalities in addition to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Patients were evaluated for the suppression of cytogenetic clonal evolution after therapy, the cytogenetic response, and survival. RESULTS: The median age of the population was 39 years (range, 15 to 70 years), median time from diagnosis to clonal evolution 14 months (range, 0 to 145 months), and median percentage of abnormal metaphases 18% (range, 4% to 100%). Fifty six patients (62%) achieved some suppression of cytogenetic clonal evolution; in 41 patients (46%), the suppression was complete. The overall median survival was 51 months, with 43% alive at 5 years. Patients who achieved a complete suppression of cytogenetic clonal evolution had a median survival of 66 months, with 51% alive at 5 years. Characteristics associated with a better response include a lower percentage of abnormal metaphases, time to cytogenetic clonal evolution of 24 months or less, and absence of other features of accelerated disease. A prognostic classification for cytogenetic clonal evolution defined three groups with complete response (CR) rates of 85%, 34%, and 0% (P < .0001) and median survival times of 58, 31, and 30 months, respectively (P=.02). CONCLUSION: Patients with cytogenetic clonal evolution can respond to IFN-alpha therapy, and this response is associated with longer survival. A previously described prognostic model separates patients into subsets with different probabilities of response to IFN-alpha and survival.","['Cortes, J', 'Talpaz, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Rios, M B', 'Majlis, A', 'Keating, M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Majlis A', 'Keating M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/10/21 00:00,1998/10/21 00:01,['1998/10/21 00:00'],"['1998/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.10.3279 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Oct;16(10):3279-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.10.3279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, both hepatitis B virus core antibody (anti-HBc) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 antibody (anti-HTLV-1) were determined in these patients to compare their prevalence rates. Seventy one patients (27%) had positive anti-HCV, 134 patients (50%) positive anti-HBc and 40 patients (15%) positive anti-HTVL-1. Among the 183 patients who had received blood transfusion, the prevalence of these antibodies was 34% for anti-HCV, 56% for anti-HBc and 17% for anti-HTLV-1, respectively. A significance between those with and without blood transfusion was recognized for anti-HCV (p < 0.001) and anti-HBc (p < 0.01). Of 56 patients who had received hemodialysis for over 15 years, the positive antibody was found in 63% for anti-HCV (p < 0.001), 73% for anti-HBc (p < 0.001) and 25% for anti-HTLV-1 (p < 0.05), which was significantly higher than that of patients receiving a less than 15 years hemodialysis. The prevalence rates of anti-HCV and anti-HTLV-1 did not increase with age, while that of anti-HBc increased.

FPGS expression in the MTX-sensitive human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM and a number of MTX-resistant sublines was previously investigated at the DNA, RNA, and activity levels. Using an FPGS peptide deduced from its cDNA sequence, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to FPGS has now been elicited, immunoaffinity purified, and used to quantitate FPGS protein expression by chemiluminescent Western immunoblot analysis. The antibody was used to determine the half-life of human FPGS protein (3.7 +/- 1.1 h) in parental CCRF-CEM cells. A subline resistant to MTX as a result of amplified dihydrofolate reductase expression shows no change in FPGS protein or activity relative to CCRF-CEM. An MTX transport-defective line, however, displays both higher FPGS protein and activity levels. For several sublines in which the only apparent mechanism of MTX resistance is decreased FPGS activity, the FPGS protein level is decreased proportionally. However, we previously showed that these sublines have the same gene copy number, restriction map, and mRNA size and levels as the parent.

It has been shown that the expression of the multidrug resistance MDR1/P-glycoprotein gene could be induced by short-term in vitro exposure of cells to protein kinase C (PKC) agonists or different chemotherapeutic drugs. We studied whether other genes involved in drug resistance are regulated by similar signaling pathways. Transient (up to 24 h) treatment of HL-60 or K562 leukemia cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) resulted in increased steady-state level of LRP (lung resistance-related protein) mRNA and protein. Among conventional chemotherapeutic drugs tested, only cytarabine (Ara C) induced the LRP mRNA expression though no increase in LRP protein was detected. LRP gene activation was not detectable in either H9 T-cell leukemia or in solid carcinoma cell lines (BT-20, ZR-75-1, and SW 1573). None of the agents influenced the levels of MRP (multidrug resistance-associated protein) mRNA in any cell line tested. In HL-60 cells, the LRP activation by TPA or Ara C was sustained for at least 23 days after withdrawal of inducing agents. bis-Indolylmaleimide I, a potent PKC inhibitor, attenuated TPA-induced LRP activation. In contrast, the inhibitor had no effect on the LRP induction by Ara C.

The nonresponsiveness to Epo presumably results from gp55, the product of the env gene encoded by the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (F-SFFV), acting as a pseudoligand and constitutively activating the receptor. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induced the differentiation of MEL cells and partially restored responsiveness to Epo, with both increased proliferation and further hemoglobin synthesis. Treatment of MEL cells with DMSO caused a decrease in the cellular content of gp55 as measured by Western analysis and an increase in the level of the EpoR as measured by [125I]Epo binding. These changes were produced at least in part at the transcriptional level, because DMSO treatment caused a decrease and an increase in the levels of the mRNAs for gp55 and EpoR, respectively. To ascertain the role of gp55 in the restoration of the sensitivity of MEL cells to Epo by exposure to DMSO, expression vectors containing gp55 DNA in the sense and antisense orientations were transfected into MEL cells to increase or decrease, respectively, the amount of cellular gp55. An increase in the level of gp55 interfered with the ability of DMSO to restore sensitivity to Epo, whereas a decrease in the level of gp55 increased the Epo-sensitizing effects of DMSO. [125I]Epo was chemically cross-linked to a component with a calculated molecular weight of 65 kDa. DMSO treatment caused an increase in the level of [125I]Epo cross-linking. The protein cross-linked to Epo was immunoprecipitated with anti-EpoR serum but not with anti-gp55 serum, suggesting that Epo was cross-linked to its receptor. The finding of a decrease in the cellular content of gp55, an increase in the level of the EpoR, and an increase in the formation of the Epo/EpoR complex is consistent with the acquisition of sensitivity to Epo by MEL cells following treatment with DMSO.","['Lin, T S', 'Ishiguro, K', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Lin TS', 'Ishiguro K', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology']",1998/10/21 00:00,1998/10/21 00:01,['1998/10/21 00:00'],"['1998/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1998;10(4):175-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs generally form a majority of monofunctional DNA adducts, although the bifunctional adducts appear to be necessary for their powerful cytotoxic and antitumor effects. The relative importance of bifunctional as opposed to monofunctional adducts in the varied biological consequences of drug exposure has not been studied in detail, particularly in relation to the role and specificity of biochemical responses to therapy-related DNA damage. A simple method is described for the preparation of useful quantities of a pure monofunctional derivative of the nitrogen mustard-based drug melphalan. Monohydroxymelphalan was prepared by partial hydrolysis, purified by reversed phase chromatography, and characterized by MS, NMR, and HPLC. Contamination with melphalan was </=0.2%. The heat labile DNA base adducts formed by monohydroxymelphalan were shown to contain undetectable levels of cross-linked species. The ratio of adenine to guanine adducts was 0.62, similar to the equivalent ratio for melphalan. The sequence-dependent pattern of alkylation of purified DNA was indistinguishable from that of melphalan, but required a higher dose to achieve comparable extents of reaction. The specificities of two monoclonal antibodies that recognize melphalan-DNA adducts were investigated using DNA alkylated with [3H]monohydroxymelphalan. Adducts on this DNA showed similar immunoreactivities to adducts formed by melphalan. This shows clearly that neither antibody was specific for cross-linked adducts and that it is therefore possible to quantify adducts formed by both monohydroxymelphalan and melphalan with high sensitivities. The availability of monohydroxymelphalan in addition to melphalan, together with sensitive immunoassays for adducts on extracted DNA and in individual cells, constitutes a useful system for investigating cellular responses to the DNA modifications formed by a clinically relevant drug.","['Tilby, M J', 'McCartney, H', 'Gould, K A', ""O'Hare, C C"", 'Hartley, J A', 'Hall, A G', 'Golding, B T', 'Lawley, P D']","['Tilby MJ', 'McCartney H', 'Gould KA', ""O'Hare CC"", 'Hartley JA', 'Hall AG', 'Golding BT', 'Lawley PD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Laboratory and Department of Chemistry, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, U.K. M.J.Tilby@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/*analysis/immunology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Melphalan/*metabolism']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/tx980129a [doi]', 'tx980129a [pii]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 1998 Oct;11(10):1162-8. doi: 10.1021/tx980129a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rare case of mediastinal mature teratoma with angiosarcoma, a hematopoietic region and granulocytic sarcoma is reported in a 29-year-old male. The resected tumor was 9.0 x 6.5 cm, weighed 65 g and showed extensive necrosis, forming a cyst. The histological features of the tumor showed a mature teratoma, which contained a large gland lined by ciliated epithelium, hyalinous cartilage, a paraganglion-like structure, well-differentiated angiosarcoma with atypical hematopoiesis composed of CD34-positive cells, and malignant round cells. The malignant round cells did not stain for CD34 but were positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and c-kit product. From these findings, the round cells were diagnosed as granulocytic sarcoma. The patient died of metastasis of the granulocytic sarcoma in the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes 8 months after surgery. A leukemic condition was not present throughout the clinical course. The association between MGCT and hematological malignancy is a distinctive syndrome. However, its pathogenesis is still obscure and the origin of the hematopoietic malignancy has not been fully elucidated.

This family of small GTPases has been involved in diverse biological functions such as cytoskeleton organization, cell growth and transformation, cell motility, migration, metastasis, and responses to stress. We report that several human Rho proteins including Rho A, Rho C and Rac 1, are capable of inducing apoptosis in different cell systems like murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the human erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Since K562 cells are devoid of p53, apoptosis induced by Rho in this system is independent of p53. Rho-dependent apoptosis is mediated by the generation of ceramides, and it is drastically inhibited by ectopic expression of Bcl2, both under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Furthermore, the human oncogenes vav and ost that have been shown to function as guanine exchange factors for Rho proteins, were also able to induce apoptosis under similar conditions. Finally, we also report that the levels of endogenous Rho proteins are increased when U937 myeloid leukemia cells are exposed to apoptosis-inducing conditions such as TNF alpha treatment. Furthermore, TNF alpha-induced apoptosis in these cells is inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac 1 but it is not affected by a similar mutant of Rho A. These results suggest that Rho proteins play an important role in the physiological regulation of the apoptotic response to stress-inducing agents.","['Esteve, P', 'Embade, N', 'Perona, R', 'Jimenez, B', 'del Peso, L', 'Leon, J', 'Arends, M', 'Miki, T', 'Lacal, J C']","['Esteve P', 'Embade N', 'Perona R', 'Jimenez B', 'del Peso L', 'Leon J', 'Arends M', 'Miki T', 'Lacal JC']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, CSIC and Departamento de Bioquimica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RHOC protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Rhoc protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoC GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'ras Proteins', '*rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein', 'rhoC GTP-Binding Protein']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202082 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Oct 8;17(14):1855-69. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the gene is expressed abundantly in T lymphocytes and has been implicated in T cell specific gene expression. In the present study we examined the function of AML1 in T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated, Fas/Fas-ligand dependent apoptosis of a T hybridoma line, DO11.10. Several independent cell clones overexpressing the AML1 protein were isolated by transfecting AML1 cDNA into these cells. These clones possessed an increased level of PEBP2/CBF DNA binding activity and were found to be resistant to apoptosis induced by anti-CD3 antibody treatment. Northern blot analysis revealed that induction of the Fas-ligand transcript was markedly suppressed in the anti-CD3 treated clones. Instead, expression of IL-2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha), which is a manifestation of proliferative TCR signaling, was induced. This was in contrast to the parental, anti-CD3 treated DO11.10 cells where induction of Fas-ligand but not of IL-2R alpha was observed. Resistance of the AML1 overexpressing cell clones to TCR-mediated apoptosis is most likely attributable to the lack of Fas-ligand induction, since simultaneous treatment with anti-CD3 and anti-Fas antibodies caused apoptosis of the clones. The overall results suggest that the AML1 protein may play a pivotal role in switching TCR signaling between apoptosis and cell proliferation in T lymphocytes.","['Fujii, M', 'Hayashi, K', 'Niki, M', 'Chiba, N', 'Meguro, K', 'Endo, K', 'Kameoka, J', 'Ito, S', 'Abe, K', 'Watanabe, T', 'Satake, M']","['Fujii M', 'Hayashi K', 'Niki M', 'Chiba N', 'Meguro K', 'Endo K', 'Kameoka J', 'Ito S', 'Abe K', 'Watanabe T', 'Satake M']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202087 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Oct 8;17(14):1813-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202087.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In adult tissues, HOX11 expression is silenced by an unknown mechanism. Aberrant expression of HOX11 occurs in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), where it is thought to be involved in T-cell immortalization. The deregulated expression of HOX11 is frequently associated with chromosomal translocations which juxtapose a T-cell receptor (TCR) gene upstream of the HOX11 gene. In these cases, it is presumed that the activation of HOX11 expression results from bringing the gene under the control of TCR enhancer elements. However, activation of HOX11 also occurs in the absence of an associated translocation in both T-ALL and erythroleukaemia cells, implying that an alternative activation mechanism may exist. We hypothesized that HOX11 may be repressed in normal T-cells and erythroid cells by the action of negative elements which may be deleted or mutated in leukaemia. We therefore conducted a search for negative elements in the human HOX11 promoter which may function to silence its expression in normal cells of the haematopoietic lineages. Since little sequence of the HOX11 promoter was available, we began our investigation by sequencing over 4.5 kilobases of untranslated DNA from upstream of HOX11. The human sequence that overlaps with the 2.1 kb of murine Hox11 is highly conserved, suggesting that a large region of DNA upstream of HOX11 may have a regulatory function. We then used transfection assays to test the ability of portions of the promoter to drive transcription of a reporter gene. These studies identified four negative elements. Two of them (NRE2 and NRE4) function in all cell lines tested, while the remaining two (NRE1 and NRE3) appear to be cell-type specific. The DNA sequences of three elements are conserved between the human and mouse HOX11/Hox11 promoters. We propose a model in which the combined action of these negative elements contributes to the overall repression of HOX11 expression in normal blood cells.","['Brake, R L', 'Kees, U R', 'Watt, P M']","['Brake RL', 'Kees UR', 'Watt PM']","['TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, West Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tlx1 protein, mouse)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202078 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Oct 8;17(14):1787-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML/RAR alpha expression is linked to leukemogenesis and to clinical sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Paradoxically, RA treatment causes transient complete remissions in most t(15;17) APL cases. The precise roles of PML/RAR alpha in triggering leukemia or in causing a maturation block are not yet known. This study explores directly these PML/RAR alpha functions in the growth and differentiation of APL cells using a hammerhead ribozyme to target PML/RAR alpha mRNA in the NB4 APL cell line. When the PML/RAR alpha cleaving but not the non-catalytic control ribozyme is introduced into the NB4 APL cell line, PML/RAR alpha protein expression is reduced. This catalysis signals growth suppression, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis without overcoming the maturation block found in these leukemic cells. These biologic effects depend on the selective pressure used to express the ribozyme from an episomal vector. Introduction of a non-catalytic, control ribozyme into NB4 cells caused no observed phenotype due to anti-sense activities. Expression of the catalytic or non-catalytic ribozymes in control cells lacking PML/RAR alpha mRNA yielded no apparent growth or differentiation effects. Thus, use of a hammerhead ribozyme that targets PML/RAR alpha expression in APL cells reveals the anti-apoptotic function of this translocation product and demonstrates that PML/RAR alpha cleavage is insufficient to overcome the differentiation block observed in these leukemic cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that persistent PML/RAR alpha expression is required to maintain basal leukemic cell growth and point to the therapeutic potential of targeting PML/RAR alpha in APL.","['Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Takle, G', 'Pace, U', 'Flynn, S', 'Allopenna, J', 'Martin, P', 'George, S T', 'Goldberg, A R', 'Dmitrovsky, E']","['Nason-Burchenal K', 'Takle G', 'Pace U', 'Flynn S', 'Allopenna J', 'Martin P', 'George ST', 'Goldberg AR', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Hospital, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202075 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Oct 8;17(14):1759-68. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202075.,,"['1F32CA61646-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2PO1-CA29502-14A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA62275-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the histologic, histochemical, and immunophenotypic findings of nine cases of surgical splenectomy and four postmortem spleens from MDS patients. Four histologic patterns were identified: one dominated by erythrophagocytosis, one characterized by red pulp plasmacytosis, one with extramedullary hematopoiesis as the only salient finding, and one with marked red pulp expansion caused by a monocytic proliferation. Wright-Giemsa and histochemical stains were performed on touch preparations in three cases and played a critical role in the precise subclassification of one MDS patient's hematologic disorder, which ultimately proved to be chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Splenectomy led to sustained improvement of cytopenias in three cases, but did not eliminate transfusion dependence for the remaining patients. Three splenectomy cases exhibited clustered Leder-negative mononuclear elements: two of these patients experienced disease progression to refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation or acute myelogenous leukemia during post-splenectomy follow-up, whereas none of the three splenectomy patients without clustered mononuclear elements did. We conclude that splenomegaly in MDS usually reflects the sequelae of dyspoiesis rather than evidence of a proliferative phase, that clustering of Leder-negative large cells may correlate with either a substantial monocytic component or, possibly, increased risk of disease progression, and that the spleen can provide diagnostic as well as prognostic information in MDS patients with splenomegaly.","['Kraus, M D', 'Bartlett, N L', 'Fleming, M D', 'Dorfman, D M']","['Kraus MD', 'Bartlett NL', 'Fleming MD', 'Dorfman DM']","['Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/*pathology/surgery']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199810000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1998 Oct;22(10):1255-66. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199810000-00011.,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, mutations in the MPL gene can cause factor-independent growth and a transformed phenotype in vivo, and MPD may be associated with altered expression of the MPL receptor or TPO. Blast cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) often display MPL, and TPO induces some of these to proliferate. In sum, MPL may play a role as part of an autocrine pathway of MPD.

CD33 is an attractive antigen to use as a target for treating AML because it is present on most AML cells. Naked antibodies are limited in their ability to kill tumor cells, although studies to date suggest there may be a role in antileukemic therapy for unlabeled anti-CD33 humanized M195 antibody after the tumor burden has been reduced by chemotherapy. Calicheamicin, a novel and toxic drug moiety conjugated to anti-CD33 antibody, is currently under investigation in patients with refractory or relapsed AML.

In patients with poor-prognosis cytogenetics, the combination of cyclophosphamide, ara-C, and topotecan, plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) appears favorable. In a recent study of triple-agent chemotherapy using fludarabine, ara-C, and idarubicin, with or without ATRA and G-CSF, median survival among poor-prognosis patients was 6-7 months, but those who received ATRA did better than those who did not, primarily because it improved survival in those who did not achieve CR. G-CSF produced higher CR rates but had no effect on survival or disease-free survival.","['Estey, E H']",['Estey EH'],"['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Retinoids/therapeutic use', 'Topotecan/therapeutic use']",1998/10/20 00:00,1998/10/20 00:01,['1998/10/20 00:00'],"['1998/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12 Suppl 1:S13-5.,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These disorders are characterized by dysregulation of growth and differentiation of multilineage stem cells, a genetic profile characterized by unbalanced abnormalities that result in ""unfavorable cytogenetics,"" and an increased frequency of intrinsic multidrug resistance. The unfavorable cytogenetics associated with this group of disorders include chromosome 5 and 7 monosomy, deletions of the long arm of chromosomes 5 and 7, inversions of chromosome 3, translocations, deletions and trisomies involving several other chromosomes. Presumably, these unbalanced chromosomal aberrations result in hemizygosity and unmasking of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In addition, polymorphisms in genes encoding metabolic detoxification enzymes, defective DNA repair mechanisms, and intrinsic chromosomal instability have been implicated in the etiology of the myelodysplastic syndromes. It is evident that the cytogenetics associated with MDS are highly complex and heterogeneous.

A simulation model for the cytogenetic response (per cent of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases) serially measured in CML patients was constructed to describe roughly the sparse information available in medical literature. The model was used to construct a summary measure of response and to formulate the treatment effect as a regression with U-shape distributed ordered categorical data. Two simple models (vertical shift model and pooled conditional response model) were specifically designed to model the treatment effect 'observed' in a simulated 'pilot' data set. The powers were contrasted with the traditional proportional odds and binary models. The comparison was based both on repeated sampling from the simulated model and on bootstrap of 'given' pilot data set. We show that the specific models that address the treatment effect directly (as anticipated from pilot data) can gain in power as compared to the traditional proportional odds model when evaluated by bootstrap. However, the proportional odds model appears to be better with repeated sampling from the simulation model. To explain this discrepancy we generated 'pilot data sets' repeatedly from the simulation model and showed that the ordering of the bootstrap power estimates is unstable with reasonably complex models dependent on the random fall of the pilot data sets. This phenomenon clearly limits the usefulness of subtle modelling the form of the treatment difference observed in a small pilot data set.","['Tsodikov, A', 'Hasenclever, D', 'Loeffler, M']","['Tsodikov A', 'Hasenclever D', 'Loeffler M']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Interferons/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction']",1998/10/20 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/20 02:02'],"['1998/10/20 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/20 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19980915)17:17<1909::AID-SIM890>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19980915)17:17<1909::aid-sim890>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 1998 Sep 15;17(17):1909-22. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0258(19980915)17:17<1909::aid-sim890>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variable response of leukaemic cells (inhibition or stimulation of proliferation) to exogenous human recombinant (rTNF) was assessed.

We have developed a new detection protocol using rTth DNA polymerase as the only enzyme catalysing both reactions for simplifying CML diagnosis. We demonstrate its efficacy investigating residual leukaemic cells in the peripheral blood of 10 patients. This assay offers several advantages over the use of conventional RT-PCR, being more sensitive, faster, less prone to false positives since no opening of the tube is required between the two reactions and requires no special oils or waxes.

This study compares the growth hormone (GH) secretion and growth of 35 patients (20 boys) given 18 Gy at 3.7+/-0.3 (SE) years, and routinely evaluated 5.4+/-0.4 years after irradiation to define the indications for GH treatment in these patients. Of these, 63% had a low GH peak (< 10 microg/l) after one (22 cases) or two (17 cases) stimulation tests. The plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and its GH-dependent binding protein were normal for age in all but two cases. The height changes between irradiation and evaluation were correlated with the GH peaks (P < 0.03) and were concordant, except in patients with early puberty. This occurred in 16 patients including all 12 girls irradiated before 4 years of age. A significant (P < 0.03) reduction in height (SD) between irradiation and adult height occurred in untreated GH-deficient patients (-1+/-0.3, n=6), but not in GH-deficient patients given GH (-0.6+/-0.3, n=8) or in those with normal GH peak (-0.4+/-0.3, n=7). CONCLUSION: In children irradiated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, GH deficiency is frequent after 18 Gy but its impact on adult height is smaller than after higher doses. We suggest that the indications for gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue therapy should be broad in patients with early or rapidly progressing puberty and those for GH therapy in those patients with a below average constitutional height before irradiation.","['Melin, A E', 'Adan, L', 'Leverger, G', 'Souberbielle, J C', 'Schaison, G', 'Brauner, R']","['Melin AE', 'Adan L', 'Leverger G', 'Souberbielle JC', 'Schaison G', 'Brauner R']","['Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Universite Paris V, and Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Human Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Puberty', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Skull/*radiation effects']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004310050918 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1998 Sep;157(9):703-7. doi: 10.1007/s004310050918.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cells, the v-Abl oncoprotein and the Jak proteins physically associate. To define the molecular mechanism of constitutive Jak-STAT signaling in these cells, the functional significance of the v-Abl-Jak association was examined. Mapping the Jak1 interaction domain in v-Abl demonstrates that amino acids 858 to 1080 within the carboxyl-terminal region of v-Abl bind Jak1 through a direct interaction. A mutant of v-Abl lacking this region exhibits a significant defect in Jak1 binding in vivo, fails to activate Jak1 and STAT proteins, and does not support either the proliferation or the survival of BAF/3 cells in the absence of cytokine. Cells expressing this v-Abl mutant show extended latency and decreased frequency in generating tumors in nude mice. In addition, inducible expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of Jak1 protein inhibits the ability of v-Abl to activate STATs and to induce cytokine-independent proliferation, indicating that an active Jak1 is required for these v-Abl-induced signaling pathways in vivo. We propose that Jak1 is a mediator of v-Abl-induced STAT activation and v-Abl induced proliferation in BAF/3 cells, and may be important for efficient transformation of immature B cells by the v-abl oncogene.","['Danial, N N', 'Losman, J A', 'Lu, T', 'Yip, N', 'Krishnan, K', 'Krolewski, J', 'Goff, S P', 'Wang, J Y', 'Rothman, P B']","['Danial NN', 'Losman JA', 'Lu T', 'Yip N', 'Krishnan K', 'Krolewski J', 'Goff SP', 'Wang JY', 'Rothman PB']","['Integrated Program in Molecular, Cellular, and Biophysical Studies, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Transfection/genetics']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.11.6795 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Nov;18(11):6795-804. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.11.6795.,,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2T32DK07328-17/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC109263,,,,

Tax activates HTLV-I gene expression via interactions with the ATF/CREB proteins and the coactivators CBP/p300 which assemble as a multiprotein complex on regulatory elements known as 21-bp repeats in the HTLV-I LTR. Tax can also activate expression from cellular genes including the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the IL-2 receptor genes via increases in nuclear levels of NF-kappaB. Tax modulation of gene expression via the ATF/CREB and NF-kappaB pathways is linked to its transforming properties.

The cDNAs encode a 59-kDa protein [nuclear DEAF-1-related (NUDR)] which shows sequence similarity to the Drosophila Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (DEAF-1), a nonhomeodomain cofactor of embryonic Deformed gene expression. Similarities to other proteins indicate five functional domains in NUDR including an alanine-rich region prevalent in developmental transcription factors, a domain found in the promyelocytic leukemia-associated SP100 proteins, and a zinc finger homology domain associated with the AML1/MTG8 oncoprotein. Although NUDR mRNA displayed a wide tissue distribution in rats, elevated levels of protein were only observed in testicular germ cells, developing fetus, and transformed cell lines. Nuclear localization of NUDR was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and by a green fluorescent protein-NUDR fusion protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of a nuclear localization signal resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the protein and eliminated NUDR-dependent transcriptional activation. Recombinant NUDR protein showed affinity for the RARE in mobility shifts; however it was efficiently displaced by retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) complexes. In transient transfections, NUDR produced up to 26-fold inductions of a human proenkephalin promoter-reporter plasmid, with minimal effects on the promoters for prodynorphin or thymidine kinase. Placement of a RARE on the proenkephalin promoter increased NUDR-dependent activation to 41-fold, but this RARE-dependent increase was not transferable to a thymidine kinase promoter. Recombinant NUDR protein showed minimal binding affinity for proenkephalin promoter sequences, but was able to select DNA sequences from a random oligonucleotide library that had similar core-binding motifs (TTCG) as those recognized by DEAF-1. This motif is also present between the half-sites of several endogenous RAREs. The derived consensus- binding motif recognized by NUDR (TTCGGGNNTTTCCGG) was confirmed by mobility shift and deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) protection assays; however, the consensus sequence was also unable to confer NUDR-dependent transcriptional activation to the thymidine kinase promoter. Our data suggests that NUDR may activate transcription independently of promoter binding, perhaps through protein-protein interaction with basal transcription factors, or by activation of secondary factors. The sequence and functional similarities between NUDR and DEAF-1 suggest that NUDR may also act as a cofactor to regulate the transcription of genes during fetal development or differentiation of testicular cells.","['Huggenvik, J I', 'Michelson, R J', 'Collard, M W', 'Ziemba, A J', 'Gurley, P', 'Mowen, K A']","['Huggenvik JI', 'Michelson RJ', 'Collard MW', 'Ziemba AJ', 'Gurley P', 'Mowen KA']","['Department of Physiology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Carbondale 62901-6523, USA. jhuggenvik@som.siu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (DEAF1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Deaf1 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Deaf1 protein, rat)', '0 (Dfd protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proenkephalin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Enkephalins/genetics', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Haplorhini', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'Rats', 'Response Elements', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.12.10.0181 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1998 Oct;12(10):1619-39. doi: 10.1210/mend.12.10.0181.,"['GENBANK/AF049459', 'GENBANK/AF049460', 'GENBANK/AF049461', 'GENBANK/AF055884']","['HD-31613/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-32484/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have failed to identify the abnormalities in energy balance that predispose these children to obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the cause of excess weight gain in children treated for ALL by testing the hypothesis that energy expenditure is reduced in these patients. Twenty children [9 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.9 (3.2) y] treated for ALL who had shown excess weight gain, but were not obese [mean body mass index SD score 0.70 (1.04)], were closely and individually matched with 20 healthy control children [9 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.7 (3.0) y; mean body mass index SD score 0.27 (0.91)]. In each child we measured total energy expenditure by doubly-labeled water method, resting energy expenditure, energy expended on habitual physical activity, and energy intake. Total energy expenditure was significantly higher in control subjects than in patients: mean paired difference 1185 kJ/d (282 kcal/d), 95% confidence interval (CI) 218-2152. This difference was largely due to reduced energy expended on habitual physical activity in the patients. Resting energy expenditure was lower in the patients: mean paired difference 321 kJ/d (76 kcal/d), 95% CI 100-541. Energy intake was also lower in the patients: mean paired difference 1001 kJ/d (238 kcal/d), 95% CI 93-1909. Children treated for ALL are predisposed to excess weight gain, and subsequently obesity, by reduced total energy expenditure secondary to reduced habitual physical activity. Prevention of obesity in ALL should focus on modest increases in habitual physical activity, modest restriction of dietary intake, and monitoring of excess weight gain.","['Reilly, J J', 'Ventham, J C', 'Ralston, J M', 'Donaldson, M', 'Gibson, B']","['Reilly JJ', 'Ventham JC', 'Ralston JM', 'Donaldson M', 'Gibson B']","['University of Glasgow Department of Human Nutrition, Yorkhill Hospitals, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Obesity/etiology', 'Physical Exertion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Reference Values', 'Survivors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', '*Weight Gain']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199810000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1998 Oct;44(4):557-62. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199810000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that MDL101,731 inhibited human ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in HeLa S3 human cervical carcinoma cells. Recently, it has been reported that another deoxycytidine analog, 2'-deoxy-2'-methylidenecytidine (DMDC) which also inhibits RNR from Escherichia coli, does not inhibit RNR in intact L1210 murine leukemia cells. MDL101,731 was designed as an inhibitor of RNR, so it is important to know the contribution of the RNR inhibitory activity of the drug on its antitumor efficacy in vivo. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the antitumor activity and RNR inhibitory activity of MDL101,731 using LX-1 human lung carcinoma which was highly sensitive to this drug. MDL101,731 showed strong inhibition of RNR activity in LX-1 lung carcinoma by both i.v. and p.o. administration. Administration of 15 mg/kg i.v. and 30 mg/kg p.o. of MDL101,731, doses which showed almost the same degree of antitumor activity against LX-1 lung carcinoma on a daily 5 day schedule, caused a similar degree and similar kinetics of inhibition of RNR in LX-1 lung carcinoma at least for 12 h after administration. On the other hand, DMDC as well as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (ara-C), which is a well-known deoxycytidine analog and inhibits DNA polymerase alpha, did not inhibit RNR in LX-1 lung carcinoma at doses demonstrating antitumor activity. These results indicate that MDL101,731 exhibited antitumor activity through inhibition of RNR activity in tumor cells in vivo and the mechanism of antitumor action of MDL 101,731 might be different from those of DMDC and ara-C, at least in part.","['Kanazawa, J', 'Takahashi, T', 'Akinaga, S', 'Tamaoki, T', 'Okabe, M']","['Kanazawa J', 'Takahashi T', 'Akinaga S', 'Tamaoki T', 'Okabe M']","['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd, Shizuoka-Ken, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'UCC4EQS7WL (tezacitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199808000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1998 Aug;9(7):653-7. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199808000-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with a role for SET in cell proliferation, set mRNA expression was markedly reduced in cells rendered quiescent by serum starvation, contact inhibition, or differentiation. Previous findings during renal development were extended by demonstrating that SET protein expression is also much greater in developing rat and human kidney than in fully differentiated, mature kidney.

This information along with signalment, anatomic site, and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen status was used to determine the potential of these indicators to predict response to therapy, remission, and survival times, and to characterize cats with lymphoma in the era of general availability of FeLV testing and vaccination. Alimentary lymphoma, primarily occurring in older, FeLV-negative cats, was the most common site of involvement. Although the majority of tumors from FeLV-positive cats were CD3-immunoreactive, only one half of CD3-immunoreactive tumors occurred in FeLV-positive cats. Median remission duration and survival times were 126 days and 143 days, respectively, for all cats. Measures of tumor cell proliferation (AgNOR frequency and PCNA-LI) and CD3-immunoreactivity were not predictive of outcome. When all prognostic factors were accounted for by multivariate analysis, response to therapy, FeLV status, and clinical substage were predictive of outcome. FeLV-negative cats that achieved a complete response following induction therapy were likely to have durable (i.e., > 6-month) responses, particularly when doxorubicin was included in the chemotherapy protocol. However, FeLV-positive cats had significantly shorter remission and survival times with available chemotherapeutic protocols.","['Vail, D M', 'Moore, A S', 'Ogilvie, G K', 'Volk, L M']","['Vail DM', 'Moore AS', 'Ogilvie GK', 'Volk LM']","['Department of Medical Science, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706, USA. valid@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*veterinary', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Vaccination/veterinary', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-1676.1998.tb02134.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 1998 Sep-Oct;12(5):349-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.1998.tb02134.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokine-producing cells in peripheral nerve include resident and recruited macrophages, lymphocytes, and likely mastocytes, Schwann cells, and probably neurons. Cytokines are instrumental in pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies during nerve lesions and tissue repair. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) injection into nerve induces Wallerian degeneration. In contrast, interleukin-1 (IL-1) promotes detersion by scavenger macrophages, and increased synthesis of neurotrophic factor (nerve growth factor--NGF--and leukemia inhibitory factor--LIF). Neurotrophic cytokines IL-6, LIF and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are overexpressed in nerve after experimental axotomy and promote axonal growth until axon/Schwann cell contact. In the course of inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, proinflammatory cytokines induce vascular permeability and breakdown of blood nerve barrier (TNF-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor--VEGF/VPF), favor leukocyte transmigration into nerve, induce activation and proliferation of lymphocytes (IL-1, IL-2) and macrophages (gamma-interferon--IFN-gamma), and have a direct myelinotoxic activity (TNF-alpha and TNF-beta).

We have investigated whether microstatellite instability (MSI) is involved in the transformation of myeloid cells to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Both de novo and treatment-associated neoplasias were studied. Only one example of MSI was found in 48 patients, using a panel of 14 different microsatellite loci consisting of repeats of one to four base pairs.

The human fibroblast growth factor 1 locus (FGF1) resides in this region of chromosome 5, which is frequently lost in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Other disease loci, including the loci for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and an autosomal dominant deafness, have been mapped on this region, but their genes have not been isolated. It was shown that the critical region lost in two patients with the 5q- syndrome resides between FGF1 and IL12B. We previously reported the construction of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning 330 kb around the FGF1 gene. Here we report the isolation of additional YAC clones that extend 290 kb from the previous contig. Sequence-tagged sites developed from the outermost YAC ends were utilized in the contig cloning of two P1 clones P1Y2 and P1Y8. Together, these YAC and P1 clones span 720 kb around the FGF1 locus. With the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization, a physical map has been constructed of these P1 and GRL (glucocorticoid receptor locus) probes on metaphase and interphase chromosomes. On the basis of our work and the known orientation of GRL transcription, the determined order of these loci on chromosome 5q31.3-q32 is centromere-P1Y8-3'[FGF1]5'-P1Y2-5'[GRL]3'-telome re. Knowing the transcriptional orientation of the FGF1 gene relative to the centromere will now facilitate the directional cloning of clinically important genes that may reside in this region.","['Chiu, I M', 'Liu, Y', 'Payson, R A']","['Chiu IM', 'Liu Y', 'Payson RA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Tagged Sites', 'Telomere', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898000314 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00031-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 Oct 1;106(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00031-4.,,['R01 CA45611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By stepwise reducing LIF concentration in the medium, we obtained 3 pSVLD(+)-transfected clones (A 1-3) that could grow in 15% BRL-CM, including ESL(+)A 2 that could grow without LIF: we also obtained 13 pSVLD(-)-transfected clones (B 1-13) which would differentiate in 60% BRL-CM, including ESL(-)B 3 and B 5 that could not be passaged without LIF. ESL(+)A 2 and ESL(-)B 5 cells had the relatively stronger LIF mRNA or antisense LIF RNA expression, and LIF overexpression in ESL(+)A 2 cells was shown by biological assay for ES cell differentiation inhibition. ESL(+)A 2 cells could be continuously passaged for at least 13 passages without addition of exogenous LIF, retained undifferentiated morphology as well as a high growth rate, and resembled ES-5 cells in terms of stem cell characteristics and pluripotent properties, as analyzed for alkaline phosphatase activity and with staining the paraffin sections of tumor formed by inoculating ESL(+) A 2 cells into mouse. On the contrary, ESL(-) cells should be cultured in higher concentration of LIF than ES-5 cells, otherwise, would undertake extensive differentiation. By hanging drop culture for 3 days in the presence of 10(-6) mol/L RA then observing the differentiation of the formed embryonic bodies (EBs), we found that ESL(+) A 2 and ES-5 cells underwent similar morphologically differentiation, with round and epitheliallike cells occurring around the EBs; while ESL(-) B 5 cells, despite initial differentiation to round cells, differentiate into fibroblast-like and spindle shaped cells. The above results indicate that LIF overexpression in ESL(+) A 2 cells is able to completely free ES cells from the dependence on LIF-conditioned medium, and endogenous LIF gene expression, although is very low, may be indispensable for inhibiting the differentiation in vitro of ES cells; LIF overexpression might not obviously change the differentiation way of ES-5 cells, however, blocking endogenous LIF expression gives rise to the increased sensitivity of ES-5 cells to differentiate, with an altered differentiation pattern. The establishment of ESL(+) and ESL (-) cell lines provides models for further study of the growth and differentiation of ES-5 cells.","['Du, X X', 'Shi, W K']","['Du XX', 'Shi WK']","['Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Academia Sinica, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,0413570,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Transfection']",1996/12/01 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 1996 Dec;29(4):413-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both cell number count and 3H-TdR uptake experiments indicated that rhTGF-beta 1 obviously inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells, and the inhibiting effect was related to its concentration. At the same time, the changes in the mode of cell growth and morphology occurred. The cells changed gradually from suspensive into adherent state and formed two groups of cell populations. The number of adherent cells formed was dependent on the concentration and duration of the treatment of rhTGF-beta 1. Therefore, based on the degree of inhibition of cell proliferation and the number of adherent cells with different rhTGF-beta 1 concentrations in a trial experiment, 1.25 ng/ml rhTGF-beta 1 was chosen as the dose in other experiments. From scanning electronmicroscopic observation, it was found that the external morphology of rhTGF-beta 1 treated THP-1 cells gradually transformed into typical macrophage-like cells. Concomitantly, their subcellular organelles also became progressively matured, with primary lysosomes typical for early M phi in 72 h and secondary lysosomes and phagosomes for mature M phi in 120 h of induction, as observed with transmission electron microscope. The ANAE activity, NBT reduction and phagocytosis of differentiated adherent cells were higher than those of control cells and suspensive cells. Specific anti-human TGF-beta-neutralizing mAb could completely block the differentiation of THP-1 cells into M phi-like cells. To sum up, from the results of the studies on cell morphology, growth mode, ultrastructures, phagocytosis, enzyme activation and TGF-beta 1 mAb blocking of induction and differentiation, it is clear that rhTGF-beta 1 can induce THP-1 cells to differentiate and mature into M phi-like cells, with the parallel development of cytoplasmic organoids, phenotype variation and the gaining of phagocytosis activity etc. Concordantly, rhTGF-beta 1 made the M phi-like cells to an activated state as they became matured during the induced differentiation.","['Yu, G H', 'Ge, X R', 'Yao, Z']","['Yu GH', 'Ge XR', 'Yao Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,0413570,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 1996 Dec;29(4):365-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The drug cytotoxities were determined by counting cell numbers and colony formation. Cell cycle phases were assayed by flow cytometry, Dox contents were quantified by Dox fluorescence. RESULTS: The non-cytotoxic concentrations of Tet and Dau potentiated the growth-inhibitory actions of Dox in the Har-resistant HL60 cells. The colony formation effiencies were reduced from 60% by Dox to 0.2% by Tet + Dox and 9.2% by Dau + Dox. Retardation of the G2M phase cells was increased. But Tet and Dau did not potentiate Dox cytotoxities in the sensitive HL60 cells. Dox accumulation in the Har-resistant HL60 cells treated by Tet was increased. CONCLUSION: Dox resistance in the Har-resistant HL60 cells treated by Tet or Dau was reduced, due to the increase of Dox accumulation in the cells. One of the mechanisms of multidrug resistance in tumor cells is overexpression of cell membrane glycoproteins, termed P-glycoprotein (PGP). PGP pumps antitumor drugs out of tumor cells, causing drug resistance. Calcium antagonists and some calmodulin inhibitors such as verapamil, nifedepine, trifluorapine have effect on reversion of drug resistance, binding directly to PGP, but side effect of them is intolerable in clinical use. So searching for other potentiators to overcome drug resistance may be another avenue. Tetrandrine (Tet) effectively circumvented the resistance of Chinese hamster ovary cells to doxorubicin (Dox). Dauricine (Dau) is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid from Stephaia tetrandra. In this paper we studied whether Tet and Dau could reduce Dox resistance in the harringtonine (Har)-resistant human leukemia 60 (HL60) cells.","['He, Q Y', 'Meng, F H', 'Zhang, H Q']","['He QY', 'Meng FH', 'Zhang HQ']","['Naval Medical Research Institute, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao,Zhongguo yao li xue bao = Acta pharmacologica Sinica,8100330,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8QTO90G5W5 (dauricine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Benzylisoquinolines', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Harringtonines', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', '*Tetrahydroisoquinolines']",1996/03/01 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao. 1996 Mar;17(2):179-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the present study, using the human monoblastic cell line (U937) and human promyelocytic cell line (HL60) as an in vitro model, we analyzed the effect of two cytokins on proliferation inhibition with rate of 3H-TdR incorporation, the cellular content of DNA, DNA indices, the cell cycle and the expression of c-myc mRNA. RESULTS: With administration of rhTGF-beta 1 and rhIL-6, U937 cell growth was inhibited and the rate of 3H-TdR incorporation inhibition was increased. There was a decrease in the cellular content of DNA and DNA indices. And no change in the cell cycle was observed after administration of rhTGF-beta 1 or rhIL-6. However, there was an increase in G0/G1 phase cells and a decrease in G2M + S phase cells after administration of combination of rhTGF-beta 1 and rhIL-6. It was also found that rhIL-6 could inhibit proliferative responses of HL60 cells, meanwhile the inhibition could be enhanced by rhTGF-beta 1. The rate of 3H-TdR incorporation inhibition rose up to 39.89%, and DNA index fell to 1.00 following induction by rhIL-6 plus rhTGF-beta 1. Furthermore, G0/G1 phase cells increased while G2M + S cells decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that combination of rhTGF-beta 1 and rhIL-6 acted in synergy to inhibit proliferation of both U937 and HL60 cell lines. Molecular hybridization test show that rhTGF-beta 1 alone, rhIL-6 alone or rhTGF-beta 1 and rhIL-6 in combination can inhibit U937 and HL60 cells expression of c-myc mRNA in a time and dose dependent manner. rhTGF-beta 1 and rhIL-6 in combination synergistically inhibited c-myc expression, which may be one of the machanisms for the actions of the two cytokines.","['Feng, R', 'Shen, S', 'Hui, H', 'Jin, M']","['Feng R', 'Shen S', 'Hui H', 'Jin M']","['Department of Haematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/17 00:00,1998/10/17 00:01,['1998/10/17 00:00'],"['1998/10/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1997 Nov;110(11):847-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Monoclonal antibody UIC2 and indirect immunofluorescence assay by flow cytometry were used to determine P-gp expression of 169 patients with ANLL, including 152 previously untreated, 7 refractory and 10 at remission. RESULTS: P-gp was expressed in 28.9% of the previously untreated ANLL cases and P-gp was lower than that in 71.4% of the refractory cases (P < 0.05). No P-gp expression was found in the patients at remission. For previously untreated AN-LL, P-gp was highly expressed in hybrid acute leukemia (66.7%) and acute monoblastic leukemia (47.4%). P-gp expression was highly associated with surface markers [cluster of differentiation (CD) 34, CD7, CD14, CD42b and CD61] and unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities. About 23% of P-gp-ANLL obtained complete remission, which was significantly lower than that (76%) in P-gp-cases.

We present the case of a 69-yr-old man who presented with acute, community-acquired hepatitis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A liver biopsy showed the typical findings of panlobular syncytial giant cell hepatitis. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated abundant nucleocapsid-like protein material in the cytoplasm and nuclei of affected hepatocytes. These structures were similar to, but distinct from, those of known paramyxoviridae, suggesting infection with a novel, related virus. In situ hybridization studies with a probe directed against the measles fusion protein gene gave a positive signal with a hepatocyte distribution. No signal was obtained with the measles nucleocapsid protein probe, suggesting that the disease agent was genetically distinct from, but related to, the measles virus. Subsequent liver biopsies were characterized by the gradual disappearance of the giant cell changes and by the concomitant development of cirrhosis. This is a case of adult GCH that resolved spontaneously and led to cirrhosis, thus implicating GCH as a potential cause of ""cryptogenic"" liver disease.

However, the relationship between these families, and the signal transduction networks that control viability-regulating genes, are only beginning to be elucidated. MCL1 is a viability-promoting member of the BCL2 family that exhibits a rapid increase in expression in response to specific differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing stimuli. The signal transduction pathway involved in eliciting this increase has now been investigated. In the ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, a rapid and sustained increase in phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members of the MAP kinase family was found to precede the increase in MCL1 expression produced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or the microtubule-disrupting agents colchicine and vinblastine. ERK activation was necessary for the increase in MCL1, as inhibition of the increase in ERK phosphorylation (with the inhibitor PD 98059) prevented the increase in MCL1 expression and caused rapid cell death by apoptosis. In addition, other agents that markedly increased ERK phosphorylation (lipopolysaccharide, okadaic acid) also increased MCL1 expression. In contrast, agents that did not have this marked effect did not increase MCL1. Upstream components in this ERK-mediated pathway were also identified, where the pathway was found to be stimulated by microtubule disruption acting through protein kinase C (PKC). These results indicate that expression of the MCL1 viability-enhancing gene is regulated through a cytoskeletal disruption-induced ERK-mediated signal transduction pathway. They therefore suggest a mechanism through which the cytoskeleton and MAP kinases can exert effects on cell viability.","['Townsend, K J', 'Trusty, J L', 'Traupman, M A', 'Eastman, A', 'Craig, R W']","['Townsend KJ', 'Trusty JL', 'Traupman MA', 'Eastman A', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-3835, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1998/10/15 00:00,1998/10/15 00:01,['1998/10/15 00:00'],"['1998/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202035 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Sep 10;17(10):1223-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202035.,,"['R01 CA057359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many BTB proteins are transcriptional regulators that mediate gene expression through the control of chromatin conformation. In the human promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, the BTB domain has transcriptional repression activity, directs the protein to a nuclear punctate pattern, and interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex. The association of the PLZF BTB domain with the histone deacetylase complex provides a mechanism of linking the transcription factor with enzymatic activities that regulate chromatin conformation. The crystal structure of the BTB domain of PLZF was determined at 1.9 A resolution and reveals a tightly intertwined dimer with an extensive hydrophobic interface. Approximately one-quarter of the monomer surface area is involved in the dimer intermolecular contact. These features are typical of obligate homodimers, and we expect the full-length PLZF protein to exist as a branched transcription factor with two C-terminal DNA-binding regions. A surface-exposed groove lined with conserved amino acids is formed at the dimer interface, suggestive of a peptide-binding site. This groove may represent the site of interaction of the PLZF BTB domain with nuclear corepressors or other nuclear proteins.","['Ahmad, K F', 'Engel, C K', 'Prive, G G']","['Ahmad KF', 'Engel CK', 'Prive GG']","['Division of Molecular and Structural Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, and the Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2M9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'X-Ray Diffraction', '*Zinc Fingers']",1998/10/15 00:00,1998/10/15 00:01,['1998/10/15 00:00'],"['1998/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.21.12123 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Oct 13;95(21):12123-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.21.12123.,['PDB/1BUO'],"['P41 RR001646/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-01646/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC22795,,,,

The ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and density in sucrose of the particles were typical of C-type retroviruses.

In this study, a rabbit model of HTLV-I infection was used to determine whether anti-Tax antibody responses could predict the presence of virus with the potential to replicate. Seven of 14 HTLV-I-infected rabbits developed anti-Tax antibody responses. The onset of Tax reactivity was variable, but once detected remained constant throughout the remainder of the 60-week course of the study. All anti-Tax antibody positive rabbits produced virus as measured by p19 expression upon coculture, while p19 was detected in only one of the Tax antibody negative animals. Thus the presence of an anti-Tax antibody response correlates with p19 expression following cocultivation, and may be a useful predictor of virus replication in HTLV-I infected individuals.","['Lydy, S L', 'Conner, M E', 'Marriott, S J']","['Lydy SL', 'Conner ME', 'Marriott SJ']","['Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Antigens/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Proviruses', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/analysis', 'Virus Replication', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1998/10/15 00:00,1998/10/15 00:01,['1998/10/15 00:00'],"['1998/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99378-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9378 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Oct 10;250(1):60-6. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9378.,,['CA62921/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Furthermore, PKD1 mRNA is expressed in various tissues and in neoplastic cell lines particularly, suggesting that polycystin might be involved in differentiation and/or proliferation of other cell types. Therefore, in order to investigate such a possible role, polyclonal antibodies against a recombinant polycystin peptide were raised and used to study polycystin expression in human leukemia cell lines committed to differentiation. Using Western blot and laser scanning confocal microscopy analyses, we demonstrated expression of polycystin in erythroleukemia K562 cells as a membrane-associated polypeptide of approximately 450 kDa, mainly localized in cell-cell contacts. Protein size and subcellular distribution were similar to those found in the kidney epithelial KJ29 cell line. In addition, K562 cell erythroid differentiation induced by hemin was characterized by a reduction in polycystin expression, as measured by Western blot and Northern blot analyses. Cytofluorimetric analysis indicated that upon hemin treatment there was a progressive reduction in the number of polycystin-expressing cells as well as in proliferation rate. Furthermore, reduction in proliferating and polycystin-expressing cells was also observed in K562 cells after serum starvation. When serum was added to the serum-deprived cells an increase in cell number as well as in number of polycystin-positive cells was observed. In addition, polycystin, also expressed in promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, was downregulated when macrophage differentiation in HL60 was induced by TPA. Therefore, in these leukemic cells downregulation of polycystin appeared to be closely related to reduction in cell proliferation and to induction of differentiation. This suggests that polycystin may play a relevant role in these cell processes.","['Aguiari, G', 'Piva, R', 'Manzati, E', 'Mazzoni, E', 'Augello, G', 'Chiari, E', 'Moretti, S', 'Neri, L M', 'del Senno, L']","['Aguiari G', 'Piva R', 'Manzati E', 'Mazzoni E', 'Augello G', 'Chiari E', 'Moretti S', 'Neri LM', 'del Senno L']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia ed Embriologia, Universita degli Studi, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TRPP Cation Channels)', '0 (polycystic kidney disease 1 protein)']",IM,"['Antibodies/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant/metabolism/pathology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/immunology', 'TRPP Cation Channels']",1998/10/15 00:00,1998/10/15 00:01,['1998/10/15 00:00'],"['1998/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94198-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4198 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Oct 10;244(1):259-67. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4198.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Following incubation with 10 nM PMA (24 h), antisense-expressing cells displayed induction of p27(KIP1) but not of p21, whereas empty vector-containing cells (U937/pREP4) exhibited induction of both p21 and p27. Antisense-expressing cells were impaired in G1 arrest, dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, dephosphorylation and reduction in activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2, and acquisition of differentiated features (e.g., plastic adherence). Bryostatin 1 induced p27 but not p21 in control cells and was less effective than PMA in initiating G1 arrest and related events. Nevertheless, disruption of p21 expression abrogated the effects of bryostatin 1 on cell cycle arrest and cellular maturation. Dysregulation of p21 did not, however, modify PMA- or bryostatin 1-mediated down-regulation of c-Myc protein. Unexpectedly, disruption of p21 failed to attenuate the net reduction in viable cell number following PMA or bryostatin 1 treatment inasmuch as impaired differentiation was accompanied by a lowered threshold for PMA- and bryostatin 1-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of p21 expression also promoted PMA- and bryostatin 1-mediated loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim ) and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical functional role for p21 in regulating myelomonocytic leukemic cell G1 arrest and differentiation following exposure to two PKC activators exhibiting disparate patterns of activity. They also suggest that following treatment with these agents, dysregulation of p21 prevents leukemic cells from engaging a normal differentiation program through a c-Myc-independent mechanism, and instead directs cells along an apoptotic pathway.","['Wang, Z', 'Su, Z Z', 'Fisher, P B', 'Wang, S', 'VanTuyle, G', 'Grant, S']","['Wang Z', 'Su ZZ', 'Fisher PB', 'Wang S', 'VanTuyle G', 'Grant S']","['Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",1998/10/15 00:00,1998/10/15 00:01,['1998/10/15 00:00'],"['1998/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94191-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4191 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Oct 10;244(1):105-16. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4191.,,"['CA35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CAA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Since the precursor form of interleukin-1beta (pre-IL-1beta) is one of the well known substrates for ICE, and a potassium/proton ionophore, nigericin, enhances IL-1beta processing, the authors hypothesized that nigericin induces apoptosis through the activation of ICE. In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated and nigericin-treated human monocytic cell line, THP-1, apoptosis was induced, as assessed as to a decrease in cell size, chromatin condensation, exposure of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation. Under exactly the same conditions, nigericin also induced IL-1beta processing in these cells, which was significantly inhibited by an ICE inhibitor, acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO. On the contrary, treatment with this inhibitor at the same concentration did not inhibit nigericin-induced apoptosis, assessed as to the decrease in cell size, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Although apoptosis induced by nigericin was also observed for LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a mouse T lymphoma cell line, EL-4, the ICE inhibitor did not inhibit the apoptosis in the cells. These results suggest that activated ICE is not involved in the apoptosis induced by nigericin. Since apopain activity was not augmented under the same conditions, neither ICE nor apopain may play any role in the nigericin-induced apoptosis.","['Watanabe, N', 'Kawaguchi, M', 'Kobayashi, Y']","['Watanabe N', 'Kawaguchi M', 'Kobayashi Y']","['Department of Biomolecular Science, Faculty of Science, Toho University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nigericin/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Potassium/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/15 00:00,1998/10/15 00:01,['1998/10/15 00:00'],"['1998/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(98)90341-6 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1998.0341 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Sep;10(9):645-53. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1998.0341.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

In myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphoid leukemia, point mutations affecting one allele are accompanied with deletion of the other allele. The complete absence of the p53 gene in these conditions probably explains the poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in these patients. In contrast, in the L3 form of acute lymphoid leukemia and Burkitt's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, punctual mutations are common (30%) and rarely accompanied with deletion of 17p.

The hematological toxicity of most standard-dose chemotherapy is not affected by age in patients with normal organic functions and good performance status, although increased toxicity with aging is suggested in the use of actinomycin-D, etoposide, vinblastin, methotrexate, methyl-CCNU, doxorubicin and mitomycin, and in dose-intensive chemotherapy. Among non-hematological toxicities, only doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity are demonstrated to be accelerated in the elderly. There is no evidence that advanced age decreases the efficacy of chemotherapy for tumors, except for Hodgkin's disease and acute leukemia. These results suggest that advanced chronological age alone is not always associated with severe toxicity and poor prognosis, and that many elderly patients with cancer will benefit from chemotherapy.

This is a rapidly growing family of receptors that currently includes receptors for growth hormone (GH); prolactin; erythropoeitin; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; interleukin(IL)s 2-7, 9-13, 15; interferon (IFN)-alpha, beta, and gamma; thrombopoietin; leptin; oncostatin M; leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); ciliary neurotrophic factor; and cardiotropin-1. Despite their diverse physiological effects in the body, ligands that bind to members of this family share multiple signaling pathways. An early and most likely initiating event for all of them is the activation of one or more members of the Janus (or JAK) family of tyrosine kinases. The activated JAK kinases, which form a complex with the cytokine receptor subunits, phosphorylate themselves as well as the receptor. These phosphorylated tyrosines form binding sites for various signaling molecules that are themselves thought to be phosphorylated by JAK kinases, including 1) signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats), which regulate transcription; 2) She proteins that recruit Grb2-SOS complexes, thereby initiating the Ras-MAP kinase pathway; and 3) insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins that are thought to regulate metabolic events in the cell. Additional other signaling molecules have been implicated in signaling by some cytokines, including protein kinase C, SH2-B beta, and intracellular Ca. This review uses the GH receptor as a model system for studying cytokine signaling and summarizes some of the data used to establish JAK2 as a GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase and to identify signaling molecules that lie downstream of JAK2. Since these pathways are shared by multiple cytokines, this review also discusses factors that might contribute to specificity of response to different cytokines.","['Carter-Su, C', 'Smit, L S']","['Carter-Su C', 'Smit LS']","['Department of Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0622, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Recent Prog Horm Res,Recent progress in hormone research,0404471,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', '*Models, Biological', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1998/10/14 00:00,1998/10/14 00:01,['1998/10/14 00:00'],"['1998/10/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recent Prog Horm Res. 1998;53:61-82; discussion 82-3.,,"['R01 DK034171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK34171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK48293/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acute effects of neurotrophic factors on the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release (miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs)) from motor nerve terminals has been examined in skeletal muscles of neonatal mice aged between 9 and 20 days. The following factors were tested at a concentration of 50 ng ml-1: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). In some experiments, the responses to 2 microM LaCl3 and 10 mM K+, or to 2-5 nM purified alpha-latrotoxin (alpha-LTX) were also measured. 2. Neither BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, LIF, IGF-1 or IGF-2 - singly or in combination - caused any significant change in MEPP frequency. GDNF, however, produced a highly significant, 2-fold increase in neurotransmitter release that was reproduced in fourteen muscles. 3. Potentiation of MEPP frequency in GDNF was of the same order as that induced by tetanic stimulation or substitution of the bathing medium with hypertonic saline; but substantially less than that induced either by lanthanum ions or alpha-latrotoxin. 4. The data suggest that concentrations of GDNF that produce maximal enhancement of motoneurone survival in vitro and in vivo also produce acute, non-saturating enhancement in transmitter release at immature mammalian neuromuscular synapses. Taken together with other reports, these findings suggest that GDNF may mediate both functional and structural plasticity of neonatal neuromuscular junctions.","['Ribchester, R R', 'Thomson, D', 'Haddow, L J', 'Ushkaryov, Y A']","['Ribchester RR', 'Thomson D', 'Haddow LJ', 'Ushkaryov YA']","['Department of Physiology, University Medical School, Teviot Place, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, UK. rr@ed.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Gdnf protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (Spider Venoms)', '65988-34-3 (alpha-latrotoxin)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Lanthanum/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Motor Endplate/drug effects', '*Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neuromuscular Junction/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism', 'Spider Venoms/pharmacology', 'Synapses/metabolism']",1998/10/14 00:00,1998/10/14 00:01,['1998/10/14 00:00'],"['1998/10/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.635bd.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol. 1998 Nov 1;512 ( Pt 3):635-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.635bd.x.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2231231,,,,

METHOD: The inhibitory constants (Ki) were obtained from the published work of Bergeron et al. Non-weighted least square method was used in deriving the regression equations with a BMDP program. An AM1 subroutine of the HyperChem program was used to optimize the geometry and calculate the molecular dipole moments and the distance between two terminal amino groups. A CQSAR program was used to calculate Clog P (oct./w.). RESULTS: A good correlation (r2 = 0.81) was obtained by using a five-parameter equation including the distance between two terminal amino groups (d), the number of cationic charge (Charge), molecular weight (MW), dipole moment (mu), and hydrogen bond forming ability (Hb). CONCLUSION: This model accounts for 81% of the variance in the data and can be used to estimate transport-inhibitory activity of many other polyamine analogues. It gives some quantitative information about the relationship between the polyamine analogues' function as transport inhibitors and their molecular structures.","['Xia, C Q', 'Yang, J J', 'Ren, S', 'Lien, E J']","['Xia CQ', 'Yang JJ', 'Ren S', 'Lien EJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,['0 (Polyamines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Polyamines/*pharmacokinetics']",1998/10/13 00:00,1998/10/13 00:01,['1998/10/13 00:00'],"['1998/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10611869808997882 [doi]'],ppublish,J Drug Target. 1998;6(1):65-77. doi: 10.3109/10611869808997882.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, daunorubicin (DNR) should not be administered to patients with cumulative DNR doses higher than 550 to 700 mg/m2, which we used for remission induction and consolidation therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To administer further doses of anthracyclines without risks in seven relapsed AML patients and in one patient with impaired heart functions receiving consolidation therapy, we used DEX as a cardioprotective agent. Patients received DEX 30 minutes before DNR 45 mg/m2 or MTX 10 mg/m2 in doses eight to 13 times higher (DNR) or 30 to 60 times higher (MTX) in the treatment cycle with 10 high doses (2,000 mg/m2/12 hr) of cytosine arabinoside plus two doses of DNR or MTX on the fourth and fifth day. When this cycle was used as reinduction therapy, complete remission was achieved in all five cases. A cycle of MTX and etoposide was given three times with DEX as consolidation. Myelotoxicity of the treatment cycles with DEX was similar to the cycles without it. Two patients received cumulative anthracyclines doses corresponding to more than 1,300 and 1,000 mg/m2 of DNR, respectively; the remaining five relapsed patients received 550 to 850 mg/m2 of DNR, all without signs of cardiac toxicity. Delayed administration of DEX after cumulative doses of DNR 500 mg/m2 in AML patients at relapse provides cardioprotection against DNR or MTX in combination with high doses of cytosine arabinoside.

Since asparaginase monotherapy was associated with a high response rate but short remission duration, the enzyme is currently employed within the framework of combination chemotherapy schedules which achieve treatment response in about 90% and long-term remissions in the majority of patients. Recently initiated clinical trials have still confirmed the eminent value of asparaginase in the combination chemotherapy of acute lymphatic leukaemia and of some subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and its important role as an essential component of multimodal treatment protocols. Despite the unique mechanism of action of this cytotoxic substance which shows relative selectivity with regard to the metabolism of malignant cells, some patients experience toxic effects during asparaginase therapy. Immunological reactions toward the foreign protein include enzyme inactivation without any clinical manifestations as well as anaphylactic shock. Severe functional disorders of organ systems result from the impaired homeostasis of the amino acids asparagine and glutamine. The changes affecting the proteins of the coagulation system have considerable clinical impact as they may induce bleeding as well as thromboembolic events and may be associated with life-threatening complications when the central nervous system is involved. Risk factors predisposing to thromboembolic complications are hereditary resistance against activated protein C and any other hereditary thrombophilia. Other organ systems potentially affected by relevant functional disorders are the central nervous system, the liver, and the pancreas, with patients who have a history of pancreatic disorders carrying an especially high risk of developing pancreatitis. Studies on the mechanisms of action and the occurrence of resistance phenomena have shown that a treatment response may only be expected if the malignant cells are unable to increase their asparagine synthetase activity to an extent providing enough asparagine to the cell; one may thus conclude that the enzyme-induced asparagine depletion of the serum constitutes the decisive cytotoxic mechanism. Independent of the asparagine depletion related cytotoxicity however, there are other mechanisms of clinical relevance like induction of apoptosis. Besides this, further influences on signal transduction cannot be excluded. Only few publications have dealt with the question of minimum trough activities to be ensured before each subsequent asparaginase dose in order to maintain uninterrupted asparagine depletion under treatment, and answers to this problem are not definitive. Clinical studies using enzymes from E. coli strains indicate that a trough activity of 100 U/l will suffice for complete asparagine depletion of the fluid body compartments with the preparations studied. These findings have been transferred to enzymes from other E. coli strains as well as those isolated from Erwinia chrysanthemi and to the PEG-conjugated E. coli asparaginases. It might be desirable to countercheck the results for confirmation or correction. The dosage and administration schedule of the various enzyme preparations required for complete asparagine depletion over a period of time have been insufficiently defined. While pharmacokinetic studies showed clinically relevant differences in biological activity and activity half-lives for enzymes from different biological sources, the findings of recently published clinical trials indicate that the therapeutic efficacy is affected when different asparaginase preparations are given by identical therapy schedules.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays an important role in the generation of DC. We previously showed that GM-CSF can induce murine erythroleukaemia cells (FBL-3) to differentiate into monocyte-like cells. To develop a new vaccinating method to stimulate the host immune response to leukaemia, we further investigate whether FBL-3 cells induced by GM-CSF can differentiate into DC in the present study. After being treated with GM-CSF, FBL-3 cells expressed high levels of 33D1 and NLDC-145, which are the specific markers of DC. The expression of MHC-II, B7-1, B7-2 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was up-regulated markedly; the typical morphology of DC were also observed by electron microscopy. Functionally, the GM-CSF-induced FBL-3 cells could apparently stimulate the proliferation of naive allogeneic and autologous T lymphocytes and induce the generation of specific CTL more efficiently than the wild-type FBL-3 cells. Mice immunized with GM-CSF-induced FBL-3 cells could resist the subsequent challenge with the wild-type FBL-3 cells.

OVERVIEW: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common form of leukemia, with more than 200,000 cases reported in the past 20 years. An uncommon complication of the disorder is central nervous system invasion. To date, only 21 cases have been reported, and their presenting symptoms have been heterogeneous and often nonspecific, including headache, cranial nerve abnormalities, confusion, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a clonal population of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment is either intrathecal or intraventricular chemotherapy with adjuvant radiation therapy or radiation alone. Prognosis is improved by prompt and aggressive therapy. In this case report, a 61-year-old man developed severe ataxia, vertigo, and occipital headaches 4 weeks after diagnosis with otherwise asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia. After treatment with both radiation to the head and neck and intrathecal methotrexate the patient achieved complete symptom resolution. Thus far, no additional systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy has been necessary. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Because central nervous system invasion is uncommon in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it may go undiagnosed and under-reported. Providers of patients with this disease need to be aware of possible central nervous system invasion when patients present with cranial nerve signs or symptoms and/or nonspecific neurologic manifestations. Early identification and prompt central nervous system-directed chemotherapy can affect morbidity and quality of life positively.","['Morrison, C', 'Shah, S', 'Flinn, I W']","['Morrison C', 'Shah S', 'Flinn IW']","['The Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Pract,Cancer practice,9312355,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant']",1998/10/10 02:13,2000/03/25 09:00,['1998/10/10 02:13'],"['1998/10/10 02:13 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/10 02:13 [entrez]']","['cproa015 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-5394.1998.006004223.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Pract. 1998 Jul-Aug;6(4):223-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-5394.1998.006004223.x.,,,,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J. 280 (1991) 171-178). Here we present evidence that the inositol polyphosphates, inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), release p100 from light-density microsomal membranes and inhibit rebinding of p100 through receptors, which are specific for IP3 or for IP6. These receptors can be co-extracted with p100 from the microsomes by 0.5 M Tris-HCl and, in the soluble state, they exhibit similar binding activity towards the inositol polyphosphates as do untreated microsomes. Soluble p100 self-aggregates and this aggregation is blocked by both IP3 and IP6. Stimulation of permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells with carbachol, via transfected muscarinic m1 receptors, results in increased levels of inositol polyphosphates and the quantitative release of p100 into the cytosol. This effect is reversible and cytosolic p100 rebinds to the membrane as the levels of inositol polyphosphates decline. These findings suggest that p100 may belong to a family of IP-binding proteins whose intracellular localization is determined by extracellular signals.","['Kassessinoff, T A', 'Gabet, A', 'Beaven, M A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R']","['Kassessinoff TA', 'Gabet A', 'Beaven MA', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptor, Muscarinic M1)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '0 (heparin-sepharose)', '8Y164V895Y (Carbachol)', '9012-36-6 (Sepharose)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbachol/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Endosomes/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Muscarinic M1', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/physiology', 'Sepharose/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2760(98)00099-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2760(98)00099-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Oct 2;1394(1):111-20. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2760(98)00099-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AP17, encoded by human CLAPS2 cDNA, is the small chain of the major clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 associated with mammalian plasma membranes. In this study, two cDNAs were isolated from a cDNA library of human blood cells. Whereas one cDNA encoded AP17, the other cDNA encoded a putative novel protein variant, termed AP17Delta. Both coding regions were completely sequenced. Consisting of 142aa residues, the predicted protein AP17Delta of 12kDa lacks 38aa residues of AP17. Using specific primers for RT-PCR, mRNAs for AP17Delta and AP17 were found in leukocytes and cultured leukemia cells.

They could be characterized by an older age, a less proliferative form of disease than the BCR-positive patients, and a frequent (six out of eight) abnormal karyotype. The FAB classification identified four CGLs and four atypical CMLs (aCML). A normal karyotype was more frequent in the patients classified as CGL whereas all the aCMLs had a chromosomal abnormality. Three patients had chromatin clumping and this morphologic feature was associated with trisomy 8 in two. No correlation between the cytogenetic, morphologic and the clinical data were found. Five patients had poor tolerance to therapy with a frequent occurrence of bone marrow failure and hemorragic syndrome, whereas three patients responded to a standard treatment of CML. Our study reinforces previous data on Ph-negative BCR-positive CMLs and emphasizes the difficulty in correlating clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic data in Ph-negative BCR-negative CMLs. However, our data also argue in favor of the existence of true Ph-negative BCR-negative CMLs and suggest that some of them can respond to a standard treatment of CML.","['Aurich, J', 'Duchayne, E', 'Huguet-Rigal, F', 'Bauduer, F', 'Navarro, M', 'Perel, Y', 'Pris, J', 'Caballin, M R', 'Dastugue, N']","['Aurich J', 'Duchayne E', 'Huguet-Rigal F', 'Bauduer F', 'Navarro M', 'Perel Y', 'Pris J', 'Caballin MR', 'Dastugue N']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1998 Aug;40(4):149-58.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the primary role of the oxygen-dependent MPO system in the destruction of certain phagocytosed microbes, subjects with total or partial MPO deficiency generally do not have an increased frequency of infections, probably because other MPO-independent mechanism(s) for microbicidal activity compensate for the lack of MPO. Infectious diseases, especially with species of Candida, have been observed predominantly in MPO-deficient patients who also have diabetes mellitus, but the frequency of such cases is very low, less than 5% of reported MPO-deficient subjects. Evidence from a number of investigators indicates that individuals with total MPO deficiency show a high incidence of malignant tumors. Since MPO-deficient PMNs exhibit in vitro a depressed lytic action against malignant human cells, it can be speculated that the neutrophil MPO system plays a central role in the tumor surveillance of the host. However, any definitive conclusion on the association between MPO deficiency and the occurrence of cancers needs to be confirmed in further clinical studies. Clinical manifestations of this disorder depend on the nature of the defect; an acquired abnormality associated with other hematological or nonhematological diseases has been occasionally described, but the primary deficiency is the form more commonly reported. Another area of interest pertinent to MPO expression is related to the use of anti-MPO monoclonal antibodies for the lineage assignment of acute leukemic cells, the definition of FAB MO acute myeloid leukemia, the identification of biphenotypic acute leukemias, and their distinction from acute leukemia with minimal phenotypic deviation. The advantage of MPO monoclonal antibodies over the MPO cytochemical assay relies in the ability of the former method to recognize the enzymatically inactive precursor forms of MPO.","['Lanza, F']",['Lanza F'],"['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies, University of Ferrara, St. Anna Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Eosinophil Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Eosinophil Peroxidase', 'Eosinophils/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Metabolic Diseases/classification/complications/*physiopathology', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/classification/complications/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/*deficiency/immunology/metabolism', 'Peroxidases/deficiency']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001090050267 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 1998 Sep;76(10):676-81. doi: 10.1007/s001090050267.,,,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, decision-tree approach to cell phenotype-based prognosis of CLL was adopted. The panel of 33 (32 different phenotypic features and serum concentration of sCD23) parameters was simultaneously presented to the C4.5 decision tree which extracted the most informative of them and subsequently performed classification of CLL patients against the modified Rai staging system. It has been shown that substantial correlation between the percentage of expression of the CD23 molecule on CD19+ B-cells, the level of sCD23, the percentage of CD45RA+, and the absolute number of CD4CD45RA+RO+ T-cells and the clinical stages, exists. The prediction vector, composed of their concatenated values, was able to correctly associate 83% of the cases in the low-risk group (Rai stage 0), 100% of the cases in the intermediate-risk group (Rai stage I and II), and 89% of the cases in the high-risk group (Rai stage III and IV) of CLL patients. Predictivity of this vector was 100%, 95%, and 89%, respectively. In conclusion, from the described analysis, it may be inferred that two processes play important roles in the progression rate of CLL: 1.deregulated function of the CD23 gene in B-cells accompanied by the appearance of its cleaved product sCD23 in the sera; and 2. functionally impaired and imbalanced CD4 T-cell subpopulations found in the peripheral blood of CLL patients.","['Masic, N', 'Gagro, A', 'Rabatic, S', 'Sabioncello, A', 'Dasic, G', 'Jaksic, B', 'Vitale, B']","['Masic N', 'Gagro A', 'Rabatic S', 'Sabioncello A', 'Dasic G', 'Jaksic B', 'Vitale B']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Ruder Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Decision Making, Computer-Assisted', '*Decision Trees', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/blood']",1998/10/10 02:12,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/10 02:12'],"['1998/10/10 02:12 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/10 02:12 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199810)59:2<143::AID-AJH7>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199810)59:2<143::aid-ajh7>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1998 Oct;59(2):143-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199810)59:2<143::aid-ajh7>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent paper (Derappe C, Haentjens G, Lemaire S, Feugeas JP, Lebbe C, Pasqualetto V, Bussel A, Aubery M, Neel D. Leukemia 1996;10:138), we observed that T lymphocytes from most of the Sezary patients [Szbeta(1-6)+] expressed high levels of beta(1-6)-GlcNAc-branched N-linked oligosaccharides while T lymphocytes from other patients [Szbeta(1-6)-] did not. Because this observation suggests the possibility of two forms of Sz, distinguished according to the expression rate of these glycans, we looked for a possible relationship between this expression rate and T-cell adhesiveness. Using an original protocol (Braut-Boucher F, Pichon J, Rat P, Adolphe M, Aubery M, Font J. J Immunol Methods 1995;178:41), we observed that T lymphocytes obtained from the Szbeta(1-6)+ patients adhered less to normal keratinocyte monolayers than T lymphocytes from Szbeta(1-6)- patients and normal donors. As assessed by FACS analysis, all the integrin-subunits studied were more expressed on Szbeta(1-6)-, especially alpha4, alpha5, beta1 and beta2, than on Szbeta(1-6)+ and normal lymphocytes. Although these results suggest that beta1- and beta2-integrin expression is involved in the adhesive properties of these T-cells, other factors, such as glycosylation, may also contribute. To demonstrate this possibility, we sought the presence of beta(1-6)-GlcNAc-branched N-linked oligosaccharides on beta1 integrins expressed by T lymphocytes from Sz patients. Immunoblot experiments, performed using the specific lectin from Phaseolus vulgaris (Leukoagglutinin form), showed that only the beta1 integrin subunit expressed by T lymphocytes from Szbeta(1-6)+ patients carried these glycans, supporting the concept of the involvement of T-cell glycosylation in the evolution of Sz.","['Braut-Boucher, F', 'Font, J', 'Pichon, J', 'Paulin, Y', 'Boukhelifa, M', 'Aubery, M', 'Derappe, C']","['Braut-Boucher F', 'Font J', 'Pichon J', 'Paulin Y', 'Boukhelifa M', 'Aubery M', 'Derappe C']","['Laboratoire de Glycobiologie et Cancerologie Cellulaires, Universite Rene-Descartes-Paris V, UFR Biomedicale, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)']",IM,"['Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*blood', 'Keratinocytes/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides/*blood', 'Sezary Syndrome/*blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698000940 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00094-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Oct;22(10):947-52. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00094-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has also shown promising results in various other solid tumours. Paclitaxel has induced apoptosis in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in both HL-60 and U937 human leukaemia cells. A recent study has shown a dose-dependent cytotoxicity for both taxanes: paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) on fresh leukaemia cells in primary culture from 16 ALL and four AML patients and proposed their use in treatment of acute leukaemia patients. AML is a heterogeneous disease in which malignant transformation and disease progression occur at the level of CD34 positive cells. Also, the multi-drug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein is expressed only in CD34 positive AML cells. Therefore, an in vitro evaluation of the efficacy of paclitaxel, a P-glycoprotein substrate, in CD34 positive AML cells is warranted before considering its clinical use in acute leukaemia patients. Since all in vitro studies of paclitaxel reported so far have involved only CD34 negative (HL-60, U937, K562) human AML cells, the aim of the present study was to evaluate paclitaxel efficacy against CD34 positive AML cells. The IC50 of paclitaxel for apoptosis was significantly higher in MHH225 CD34 positive cells (12 +/- 2 microM) than in U937 CD34 negative cells (1.7 +/- 0.2 microM), P < 0.001. Paclitaxel has a significantly weaker cytotoxic effect on CD34 positive AML cells. One log higher concentration of paclitaxel was required in MHH225 CD34 positive AML cells to achieve the same apoptosis level achieved in U937 CD34 negative leukaemia cells. Also, at the high concentration achievable in vivo: 10 microM paclitaxel, only half the MHH225 CD34 positive AML cells were apoptotic versus 72% of U937 CD34 negative leukaemia cells. Clearly, paclitaxel has only weak or modest in vitro efficacy compared with several conventional anti-leukaemia drugs used in AML treatment. The present results support the poor level of in vivo induction of apoptosis achieved during a phase I clinical study with paclitaxel therapy in 26 leukaemia patients. Also, the present results have shown a significant increase in nitric oxide production during paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in U937 monocytic leukaemia cells, confirming the vital role of nitric oxide in mediating paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by monocytic cells. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated a clear difference between the effect of paclitaxel on CD34 negative and CD34 positive AML cells. Given its poor performance in the phase I clinical study of 26 acute leukaemia patients and the present weak in vitro cytotoxic effect, it is unlikely that paclitaxel will have a role in the treatment of acute leukaemia. Also, the present study emphasises the need to use CD34 positive AML cells such as MHH225 rather than the unsuitable lineage-specific CD34 negative cells such as HL-60 or U937 for in vitro pre-clinical screening of potential novel effective anti-leukaemia agents.","['Al-alami, O', 'Sammons, J', 'Martin, J H', 'Hassan, H T']","['Al-alami O', 'Sammons J', 'Martin JH', 'Hassan HT']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Wolverhampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698000927 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00092-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Oct;22(10):939-45. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00092-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used growth factor-dependent cell lines to assess TGF-beta1 effects on human myeloid leukemia cell growth. While four lines were completely or predominantly resistant, TGF-beta1 inhibited effectively, albeit to various extents, the growth of 12 other cell lines. This effect was dose dependent and specific, because a neutralizing anti-TGF-beta1 antibody prevented TGF-beta1-induced growth suppression. In the present system, basic fibroblast growth factor, known as an antagonist of TGF-beta1 counteracting its inhibitory effects, did not abrogate the suppressive effects of TGF-beta1. Other growth-stimulatory cytokines negated the TGF-beta1-induced inhibition in several cell lines, again to various extents. When proliferation was enhanced by growth-promoting cytokines (e.g. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF, stem cell factor, SCF, or PIXY-321), some previously TGF-beta1-sensitive cell lines acquired cellular resistance toward TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression, whereas four other cell lines remained susceptible to TGF-beta1 growth inhibition despite possible counteraction by other cytokines. Thus, three growth response patterns to TGF-beta1 were seen: (1) constitutive resistance; (2) factor-dependent relative resistance; and (3) sensitivity to growth inhibition indifferent to counteracting cytokines. In the latter case, TGF-beta1 did not downregulate expression of one specific growth factor receptor. These studies indicate that human myeloid leukemia cells, represented here by leukemia cell lines as model systems, exhibit heterogeneous growth responses to TGF-beta1; its inhibitory effects can be modulated or completely alleviated by positive antagonistic cytokines. The availability of TGF-beta1-susceptible and -refractory cell lines allows for detailed investigations on the mechanisms of these regulatory pathways, the nature of TGF-beta1-resistance, and the possible contribution of acquired TGF-beta1-resistance to disease progression.","['Drexler, H G', 'Meyer, C', 'Zaborski, M', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Meyer C', 'Zaborski M', 'Uphoff CC', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig. hdr@gbf.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (PIXY321 fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212698000885 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00088-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Oct;22(10):927-38. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00088-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, defensin mRNA was also induced in undifferentiated HL-60 cells, but not in others, by cAMP alone. By contrast, modulators that cooperated with RA had adverse effects on the normal capacity of dimethyl sulfoxide to up regulate these transcripts as well.

Depending on the total leukocyte count, a myelodysplastic type (MDS-CMML) (< or = 13,000 microl(-1)) was separated from a myeloproliferative type (MPD-CMML) (> 13,000 microl(-1)). Based on retrospective analyses of 158 patients with CMML, we compared the presenting clinical and hematological features of both disorders and examined whether the refined classification is important in terms of prognosis. There were 81 patients with MDS-CMML and 77 patients with MPD-CMML. Median age of patients at diagnosis (70 versus 72 years) was not different. The sex ratio showed a preponderance of males in the MPD group (m:f; 2.1:1). Splenomegaly was more common in MPD-CMML (54 versus 30%; P = 0.002). With regard to laboratory findings, patients with MPD-CMML presented with significantly higher LDH values (medians 295 versus 231 U ml(-1); P = 0.008) and higher serum deoxythymidine kinase levels (medians 150 versus 41 U microl(-1); P = 0.0025). Except for white blood cell count (WBC), peripheral blood counts were not different. Median percentage of bone marrow blasts was 9% and cumulative survival rates were similar in both disorders. Two years after diagnosis, actuarial survival for patients with MPD-CMML was 33%, as compared to 50% for patients with MDS-CMML (P = 0.31). The probability of transformation to AML was higher in MDS-CMML (32 versus 17% after 5 years), but this difference also did not reach statistical significance. The survival of patients with MDS-CMML was similar to that of other MDS patients (RAEB) who had corresponding medullary blast counts. Using the Dusseldorf-score, we could define two risk groups within MDS-CMML with a median survial of 12 versus 40 months (P = 0.001). None of the known scoring systems could define risk groups within the MPD-CMML group. In summary, these data suggest that MDS-CMML and MPD-CMML are clinically distinguishing conditions, but the separation provides little prognostic information.

In this communication, we present evidence to show that these proteins inhibit tumor cell proliferation by participating in the activation of tumor cell differentiation.

Initiation of proliferation but not of differentiation was followed by a 20- to 25-fold increase in the nuclear level of the DNA polymerase-associated processivity factor PCNA and of the proliferation-specific transcription factor E2F1. In contrast, induction of differentiation but not of proliferation was followed by a 25- to 30-fold increase in the nuclear level of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 (wild type), pRb, and p130/Rb2 and of the p53-dependent cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1. p53 and p21/Cip1, respectively, inhibit the expression and activation of PCNA, whereas p130 and pRb, respectively, inhibit the expression and activation of E2F1. As a result, G1-S-associated DNA and mRNA synthesis is inhibited, growth uncoupled from differentiation, and maturation enabled to proceed.

An in-frame, chimeric mRNA that fused NUP98 sequences to the homeobox gene HOXD13 was cloned; the predicted fusion protein contains both the GLFG repeats from NUP98 as well as the homeodomain from HOXD13. The NUP98-HOXD13 fusion is structurally similar to the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion previously identified in patients with AML, leading to the speculation that NUP98-homeobox gene fusions may be oncogenic. Moreover, this report, along with a recent study that demonstrated NUP98-DDX10 fusions in patients with t-AML, raises the possibility that NUP98 may be a previously unsuspected target for chromosomal translocations in patients with t-AML.","['Raza-Egilmez, S Z', 'Jani-Sait, S N', 'Grossi, M', 'Higgins, M J', 'Shows, T B', 'Aplan, P D']","['Raza-Egilmez SZ', 'Jani-Sait SN', 'Grossi M', 'Higgins MJ', 'Shows TB', 'Aplan PD']","['Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (HOXD13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/genetics', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Oct 1;58(19):4269-73.,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-18 induced heterotypic aggregation between KG-1 and Peer T cells, which was blocked by anti-ICAM-1 and/or LFA-1 antibodies. Anti-interferon-gamma antibody did not block the IL-18-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 on KG-1 cells. These results thus show that IGIF/IL-18, enhances ICAM-1 expression in KG-1 cells in an interferon-gamma-independent pathway, up-regulates ICAM-1 functions, and that IL-18 might play a potential role in immunoregulation by mediating immune cell infiltration into the tissues.","['Kohka, H', 'Yoshino, T', 'Iwagaki, H', 'Sakuma, I', 'Tanimoto, T', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Kurimoto, M', 'Orita, K', 'Akagi, T', 'Tanaka, N']","['Kohka H', 'Yoshino T', 'Iwagaki H', 'Sakuma I', 'Tanimoto T', 'Matsuo Y', 'Kurimoto M', 'Orita K', 'Akagi T', 'Tanaka N']","['First Department of Surgery, Okayama University School of Medicine, Shikata, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/genetics', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interferon Inducers/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-18/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'L-Selectin/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/genetics', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.64.4.519 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1998 Oct;64(4):519-27. doi: 10.1002/jlb.64.4.519.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have devised a novel single cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to examine the integration of HTLV-I provirus genome in cells from two patients with ATL. To isolate single cells, peripheral blood smears were prepared on thin polyester slides and stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Morphologically defined single cells were cut out after light microscopy.

We have established a PCR method to amplify t(11;14) junctional sequences in DNA from fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue by bcl-1-specific primers in combination with a consensus immunoglobulin JH primer. A total of 65 cases histologically classified as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were analyzed for the presence of a t(11;14) translocation and monoclonal IgH-CDR3 rearrangements. From 26 patients with classical MCL and three cases with the anaplastic variant of MCL fresh frozen biopsy material was available for DNA extraction. We detected a bcl-1/JH rearrangement in 12 out of 29 samples (41%). In 36 cases paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue was the only source of DNA. In this material we found a bcl-1/JH rearrangement in six out of 31 samples with intact DNA (20%). To confirm the specificity of the PCR and to determine the bcl-1/JH junctional region sequences as clone-specific marker in individual patients we characterized the junctional DNA sequences by direct PCR sequencing in 16 cases. Interestingly we found that six bcl-1/JH junctions harbored DH segments in their N regions indicating that bcl-1/JH rearrangements can occur in a later stage of B cell ontogeny during which the complete VH to DH-JH joining or VH-replacement takes place. To investigate the suitability of IgH-CDR3 as sensitive molecular marker for those MCL patients in which a t(11;14) translocation can not easily be amplified, we additionally analysed 60 cases for the presence of monoclonally rearranged IgH genes by IgH-CDR3-PCR. A monoclonal IgH-CDR3 PCR product could be identified in 24 out of 29 fresh frozen samples (79%) whereas only 11 out of 31 samples (36%) with paraffin-derived DNA were positive. We demonstrate that automated fluorescence detection of monoclonal IgH-CDR3 PCR products allows the rapid and sensitive monitoring of minimal residual disease also in cases that lack a PCR amplifiable t(11;14) translocation. In combination with allele-specific primers the procedure may improve current experimental approaches for detection of occult MCL cells at initial staging and residual disease during and after therapy.","['Pott, C', 'Tiemann, M', 'Linke, B', 'Ott, M M', 'von Hofen, M', 'Bolz, I', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Parwaresch, R', 'Kneba, M']","['Pott C', 'Tiemann M', 'Linke B', 'Ott MM', 'von Hofen M', 'Bolz I', 'Hiddemann W', 'Parwaresch R', 'Kneba M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Consensus Sequence', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, bcl-1', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401172 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1630-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a major concern with important clinical consequences is the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. After using ceftazidime with a glycopeptide as initial empiric therapy for neutropenic fever, we were confronted with a 75% reduced susceptibility rate to ceftazidime of inducible Enterobacteriaceae collected in 1994. The initial empiric therapy was therefore replaced in May 1995 by a combination of cefepime with amikacin, with addition of a glycopeptide after 48 h if necessary. After this change, we observed a significant decrease in reduced susceptibility of inducible Enterobacteriaceae, not only to ceftazidime, but also to amikacin, cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin. There was also a decrease in reduced susceptibility of non-inducible Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella spp, to ceftazidime. The reduction of resistance may be related at least in part to the combined use of cefepime together with an aminoglycoside.

These limitations might be overcome by YNK01 -- a lipophilic prodrug of AraC -- that is resistant to deoxycytidine deaminase and can be applied orally. In the present study the therapeutic activity, side-effects and pharmacokinetics of YNK01 were evaluated in a phase I/II study including patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=23) or low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n=20). YNK01 was given by 14 day cycles with escalating doses starting with a daily dose of 50 mg/m2 (equivalent to 20 mg/m2 AraC on a molar basis). The maximum tolerated dose was reached at the 600 mg/m2 dose level with WHO grade 3-4 diarrhoea as the main toxicity. In the 23 patients with AML two complete remissions, four partial remissions and three patients with stable disease were observed. In the 23 patients with AML two complete remissions, four partial remissions and three patients with NHL two cases reached partial remission and six other patients mainained stable disease. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed during 34 treatment cycles in 28 patients. The data suggest that YNK01 was absorbed in the distal part of the small intestine and taken up into hepatocytes. After hepatic psi and subsequent beta-oxydation of YNK01 the released AraC (and its deamination product AraU) appeared in the systemic circulation. Time of maximum concentration (h), half-life (h) and area under the curve (ng x h/ml, at the 1200 mg dose level) were as follows (VC variation coefficient) YNK01: 1.0 (0.58), 10.1 (0.43), 12622 (0.65); AraC: 23.2 (0.57), 22.6 (0.36), 3496 (0.76); AraU: 19.2 (0.58) 22.3 (0.33) 15441 (0.66). Of the total dose of YNK01 15.8% was absorbed and metabolized to AraC and AraU, defining the metabolic bioavailability of this prodrug. A linear relationship was observed between YNK01 dose and YNK01 AUC and AraC AUC over the whole dose range tested. AraC was released from hepatocytes over a prolonged period of time resulting in long lasting plasma levels similar to a continuous i.v. infusion. After administration of YNK01 at a dosage of 100-150 mg/m2 plasma levels of AraC were comparable to those achieved after low-dose AraC treatment (20 mg/m2) while at doses of YNK01 of 450-600 mg/m2 concentrations of standard-dose AraC (100 mg/m2) were obtained. We conclude that YNK01 shows considerable activity against relapsed and refractory AML and NHL and that its pharmacokinetic properties offers advantages in comparison to (standard) i.v. or s.c. AraC in clinical practice.","['Braess, J', 'Freund, M', 'Hanauske, A', 'Heil, G', 'Kaufmann, C', 'Kern, W', 'Schussler, M', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Schleyer, E']","['Braess J', 'Freund M', 'Hanauske A', 'Heil G', 'Kaufmann C', 'Kern W', 'Schussler M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schleyer E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""3I7U8R8NWC (1-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-stearylphosphate)"", 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleotides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Prodrugs/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Regression Analysis']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401152 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1618-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In East Europe and USA the disease incidence is high while in Asia and Africa CLL is rare. The present study deals with 302 cases of B cell CLL and related disorders; 207 patients originating from Europe and America (Ashkenazi Jews) and 95 descendants from Asia, The Mediterranean or Africa (Sephardic Jews). The patients were recruited during 1975-1996 in a single center covering the Hashfela region -- a Southern area of Israel with a current population of 430000 inhabitants. Incidence of the disease, clinical pattern, biological parameters, prognosis and outcome were investigated and compared in both ethnic groups. The results of this study show a high incidence of CLL in Israel. The mean annual age-adjusted incidence 4.3 per 100000 person-year is among the highest reported values. Our study confirms previous data on the prevalence of CLL in Ashkenazi compared to Sephardic Jews. The rise in CLL rate in the reviewed period occurred in both populations, mainly in the Sephardic group. The relative risk for Ashkenazies compared to Sephardics decreased from 6.0 in the 1975-1979 period to 2.4 in 1990-1996. A high rate of CLL was found in new immigrants from the former USSR with 26 cases de novo diagnosed and 11 prevalent cases not included in this series among approximately 60000 new immigrants in the ara over the last 8 years. No differences were found in clinical, laboratory and immunological parameters at the time of diagnosis in the two ethnic groups. The follow-up showed a similar pattern in the disease evolution. A preliminary study of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement performed in 14 patients showed no significant differences in JH hybridization in the early stages of the disease, but more aberrations in advanced CLL in the Ashkenazi group. Our findings suggest that ethnic origin of the patients itself does not affect the biological and clinical behavior of this disease.","['Shvidel, L', 'Shtarlid, M', 'Klepfish, A', 'Sigler, E', 'Berrebi, A']","['Shvidel L', 'Shtarlid M', 'Klepfish A', 'Sigler E', 'Berrebi A']","['Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Hebrew University, Faculty of Medicine, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Africa/ethnology', 'Age Factors', 'Asia/ethnology', 'Disease Progression', 'Ethnicity/*genetics/statistics & numerical data', 'Europe/ethnology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Jews', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Characteristics', 'United States/ethnology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401140 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1612-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that TPO, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and, at least in short-term assays, also interferon gamma (IFN gamma) induced proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M7)-derived M-07e cells. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway was activated after stimulation with any of the three cytokines. Thus, the TPO-receptor (TPO-R) MPL was tyrosine phosphorylated after a short-term stimulation with TPO, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 and STAT 5, but not of STAT 1. IL-3 and IFN gamma induced phosphorylation of STAT 5 or STAT 1, respectively, without affecting the other STATs. As STATs are thought to regulate proliferation by modulating expression of inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), we analyzed p21 and p27 expression after stimulation with TPO or IL-3. In contrast to the constitutively low p21 expression, p27 mRNA levels were high in synchronized, cytokine-deprived cells in G0/1 phase. Stimulation with TPO or IL-3 induced a rapid decrease of p27 mRNA. The phosphorylation cycle of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) was inversely correlated with the level of p27 mRNA. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb was detectable 9 h after onset of stimulation, concomitantly with the decrease of p27 mRNA and shortly before transition of the cells into S phase. As phosphorylation of Rb is a key event for transition of cells into S phase, our observations support the notion of p27 being an important regulator during cytokine-induced proliferation. Whether the JAK/STAT pathway is directly involved in p27 expression or not, remains to be elucidated. The JAK inhibitor AG-490 blocked cytokine-induced STAT 5 phosphorylation and proliferation of M-07e cells in a dose-dependent manner. Although these data indicate a role for the JAK/STAT pathway in cytokine-induced proliferation, a direct influence on the p27 mRNA downregulation has to be confirmed. The second major effect of TPO, polypoidization, could not be observed in M-07e cells. Even long-term culture with TPO did not induce endomitosis in these cells. However, polyploidization could be brought about by the kinase inhibitor K-252a. After 3 days of exposure to this reagent, 17% of the originally mononucleated cells contained two to five nuclei. K-252a-induced polykaryon formation was not preceded by STAT 5 phosphorylation. Thus, K-252a did not mimic TPO stimulation at the early steps of the signaling chain. Taken together, our experiments confirm a role for the JAK/STAT pathway in cytokine-induced proliferation; TPO and IL-3 induce downregulation of the Cdk inhibitor p27, hyperphosphorylation of Rb and subsequently transition of the cells into S phase; the kinase inhibitor K-252a induces polyploidization of M-07e cells, but this effect is independent of STAT 5 phosphorylation.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Carbazoles/*pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', '*Milk Proteins', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', '*Polyploidy', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401170 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1603-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize its hematopoietic activities, we investigated the effects of amifostine and its dephosphorylated metabolite, WR1065, on the in vitro growth of human bone marrow progenitors. Preincubation exposure to amifostine or WR1065 stimulated the growth of colony-forming units granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) and erythroid bursts (BFU-E) from bone marrow mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Over the concentration range tested (0.1-1000 microM), pretreatment with the aminothiols enhanced formation of CFU-GEMM up to five-fold and BFU-E nine-fold, compared to a three-fold increase in myeloid colony recovery. In CD34+ selected cells, preincubation with amifostine increased formation of CFU-GEMM up to 38-fold and produced macroscopic colonies, exceeding colony number in cultures initiated with optimal concentrations of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, or kit ligand (KL). When compared with recombinant human cytokines, amifostine enhanced IL-1 and IL-3 induced colony formation, although its stimulatory effect was less than additive. In contrast, pretreatment with amifostine antagonized the stimulatory effects of KL, whereas synergy was observed with concurrent exposure. Ex vivo expansion studies showed that amifostine alone supported and augmented the production of myeloid progenitors in secondary cultures. Similarly, under cytokine-deficient conditions, amifostine promoted cell survival and delayed apoptosis as measured by nucleosome generation. These data indicate that amifostine is a novel multipotent hematopoietic stimulant that augments the formation and survival of bone marrow progenitors.","['List, A F', 'Heaton, R', 'Glinsmann-Gibson, B', 'Capizzi, R L']","['List AF', 'Heaton R', 'Glinsmann-Gibson B', 'Capizzi RL']","['Arizona Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, College of Medicine, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401151 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1596-602. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marked expansion of CD57+ cells among circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes was frequently detected in patients with chronic leukemia of B cell origin (B-CLL, hairy cell leukemia) but not in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, suggesting a causal relation with the tumor's major histocompatibility complex class II expression. Using immunomagnetic separation techniques, we further demonstrate that the patients' CD57+/CD28- T cells display a typical Th1-type cytokine secretion profile upon anti-CD3 stimulation, with a markedly higher secretion of the Th1-type cytokines IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha than their CD57-/CD28+ counterparts. Cytotoxic activity of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes, measured ex vivo in an anti-CD3-redirected assay, was almost exclusively exerted by the CD57+/CD28- subset. Moreover, a marked cytotoxic activity was detected within CD4+CD57+ T cells from some B-CLL patients.

Pre-treatment of SR-91 cells with TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma, increased both ICAM-1 (CD54) expression on SR-91 cells and binding to the human NK cell line NK-92. However, only TNF-alpha-treated SR-91 cells became sensitive to killing by NK-92 cells. The increased binding induced by both cytokines and the TNF-alpha-induced sensitivity of SR-91 cells to NK-92 cell killing were abrogated by anti-LFA-1 mAb as well as by a combination of antibodies against the three ligands of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), ICAM-1 (CD54), ICAM-2 (CD102) and ICAM-3 (CD50). This indicated that LFA-1 interaction with the three ICAMs on SR-91 cells is essential for effector-target cell binding (which is a prerequisite for subsequent target cell lysis), but is insufficient to render the SR-91 cells sensitive to killing by NK-92 cells. TNF-alpha, but not IFN-gamma also induced the activation of LFA-1, CD44 and beta1 integrins on SR-91 cells. Based on these observations we propose that the differential effect of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma could be related to the activation of certain adhesion molecules on the surface of SR-91 cells by TNF-alpha that, upon interaction with their counter-receptors on NK-92 cells, lead to the activation of the NK-92 cells.","['Maki, G', 'Krystal, G', 'Dougherty, G', 'Takei, F', 'Klingemann, H G']","['Maki G', 'Krystal G', 'Dougherty G', 'Takei F', 'Klingemann HG']","['BC Cancer Research Centre, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401145 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1565-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we evaluated the hypotheses that this extensive disease is the result of extramedullary survival of leukemia cells due to resistance to stress-induced cell death. Leukemias with t(4;11)(MLL-AF4) were found to be resistant to the cell death that results from serum deprivation in vitro when compared with B lineage acute leukemias without t(4;11)(MLL-AF4). Cells with t(4;11)(MLL-AF4) did not have increased doubling time or increased numbers of cells in cycle. These results suggest that the alteration in cellular homeostasis in these leukemias is due to abnormalities of cellular destruction rather than cellular proliferation when compared to other leukemias. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that death of non-t(4;11) leukemias occurs in the microenvironment outside of the bone marrow as a result of deficient cellular and humoral growth factors. Resistance to death signals in t(4;11) leukemias results in extensive accumulation of leukemia cells in extramedullary sites and likely contributes to the poor prognosis of these leukemias.,"['Kersey, J H', 'Wang, D', 'Oberto, M']","['Kersey JH', 'Wang D', 'Oberto M']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401148 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1561-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401148.,,['CA49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the involvement in this apoptotic cell death of caspases, which cleave critical cellular substrates thereby acting as the executioners of the apoptotic process. Induction of spontaneous or chlorambucil/prednisolone-induced apoptosis of freshly isolated B-CLL cells in culture resulted in the activation of the 'effector' caspases, -3 and -7, but generally not of caspase-2. Activation of caspases-3 and -7 was accompanied by the proteolysis of the DNA repair enzyme, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Induction of apoptosis was also accompanied by the processing of caspase-8, the extent of which varied between patients. Induction of apoptosis and processing of all the caspases was inhibited by the cell permeable caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.fmk). Our results demonstrate a key role for the activation and processing of caspases in the execution phase of apoptosis in CLL cells. Apoptosis of CLL cells resulted in the selective activation of some but not all caspases. Our results suggest that the dysregulation of apoptosis observed in CLL may be due to the signalling leading to the activation of caspases rather than a deletion of pro-caspases. High levels of caspase-8 in CLL cells in conjunction with low levels of CD95 receptor may offer new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of CLL.","['King, D', 'Pringle, J H', 'Hutchinson, M', 'Cohen, G M']","['King D', 'Pringle JH', 'Hutchinson M', 'Cohen GM']","['Department of Pathology, MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Repair', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401153 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1553-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401153.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This toxicity was manifested as the appearance of high levels of reactive oxygen generation in GSH-depleted cells, and later by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in intracellular calcium. Striking heterogeneity in BSO sensitivity was observed in a series of four human AML cell lines, and in fresh leukemic blasts obtained from eight AML patients. In some cases, toxicity was seen at BSO concentrations as low as 1 microM; approximately 100-fold less than the plasma levels achieved in patients treated with BSO as a drug resistance reversing agent. Based on these results we propose that some AML blast populations are unusually dependent on GSH-based antioxidant mechanisms, due to high intrinsic rates of reactive oxygen generation. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is the most likely source of this reactive oxygen. Because toxicity is seen at clinically achievable concentrations of BSO, this agent might have antileukemic activity in patients.","['Hedley, D W', 'McCulloch, E A', 'Minden, M D', 'Chow, S', 'Curtis, J']","['Hedley DW', 'McCulloch EA', 'Minden MD', 'Chow S', 'Curtis J']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/*toxicity', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401138 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1545-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies on cells overexpressing MRP and/or Pgp, have shown a concentration of the drug inside cytoplasmic acidic vesicles followed by an exocytotic process. In this study, we examined the effects of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole or NBD (a H+-ATPase pump inhibitor), buthionine sulphoximine or BSO (an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis) and verapamil or VPL (a calcium channel blocker) on the subcellular distribution of daunorubicin or DNR in K562 cells overexpressing MRP (K-H30) and Pgp (K-H300) and A549 cells overexpressing spontaneously MRP. Nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of DNR was carried out using scanning confocal microspectrofluorometry. This technique allows determination of nuclear accumulation of anthracyclines. Our results show that nuclear accumulation of DNR in K-H30 and A549 cells was increased by NBD, BSO and VPL while in K-H300 cells, only VPL was able to increase nuclear accumulation of DNR. Similarly, NBD, BSO and VPL could reverse DNR resistance in K-H30 cells whereas, in K-H300 cells, only VPL increased the sensitivity of these cells. These data suggest a requirement for GSH in MRP-mediated resistance and suggest that even if vesicular sequestration can happen in cells overexpressing MRP and Pgp proteins, probably only the MRP protein is able to extrude the drug through intracellular vesicles and efflux. Finally, NBD and BSO might be a useful agents in facilitating discrimination between Pgp and MRP phenotypes and prognosis in patients.","['Benderra, Z', 'Morjani, H', 'Trussardi, A', 'Manfait, M']","['Benderra Z', 'Morjani H', 'Trussardi A', 'Manfait M']","['Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Biomoleculaire, UFR de Pharmacie, IFR53, Reims, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/toxicity', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Harringtonines/*toxicity', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401166 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1539-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested that 9-cis RA, a retinoid receptor 'pan agonist' did not induce its own catabolism to the same extent as all-trans RA. Therefore, we conducted a dose-ranging study of this compound in patients with both relapsed and newly diagnosed APL. We treated 18 patients with morphologically diagnosed APL (13 relapsed, five newly diagnosed). The daily dose of 9-cis RA ranged from 30 to 230 mg/m2/day given as a single oral dose. Four of 12 (33%) relapsed patients (three of whom were previously treated with all-trans RA) and four of five (80%) newly diagnosed patients achieved complete remission. The sole failure in the newly diagnosed group died early from an intracranial hemorrhage. One other patient with t(9;12) translocation had substantial hematologic improvement. The drug was generally well tolerated; headache and dry skin were the most common adverse reactions. Three patients were treated with corticosteroids for signs of incipient 'RA syndrome.'

PEL grows exclusively in body cavities as serous lymphomatous effusion without evidence of mass disease or dissemination. Their most unique feature is infection with the newly discovered human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8; also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), often accompanied by co-infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A number of continuous lymphoma cell lines have been established from the malignant pleural effusion, ascitic fluid and peripheral blood of patients with AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated PEL. While all cell lines are HHV-8+, about half of them also contain EBV sequences. Stimulation of the cell lines causes switch from latent to lytic HHV-8 infection. The cells are generally negative for T and B cell immunomarkers (except for CD138 suggesting a pre- or terminal plasma cell stage) and positive for some activation and adhesion markers; they are genotypically B cells with their immunoglobulin genes rearranged. Complex, hyperdiploid karyotypes with multiple structural abnormalities are seen in the cell lines examined. No alterations of known proto-oncogenes are detected in PEL, with the exception of BCL-6 mutations occurring in a large percentage of cases. Heterotransplantation of the cell lines into immunodeficient mice leads to the development of lymphomatous effusion and marked angiogenesis. As HHV-8 contains DNA sequences of several protein homologues, the cell lines express various cytokines, cytokine receptors, chemokines, cell cycle and anti-apoptosis modulators which are upregulated upon stimulation. Indeed, some cell lines produce high levels of (human) interleukin-6 and interleukin-10. Taken together, these cell lines represent very important model systems for the elucidation of the pathobiology of PEL; furthermore, the cell lines are extremely useful scientific tools providing a resource to pursue studies of HHV-8-mediated pathogenic mechanisms.","['Drexler, H G', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Gaidano, G', 'Carbone, A']","['Drexler HG', 'Uphoff CC', 'Gaidano G', 'Carbone A']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/pathology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401160 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1507-17. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401160.,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objectives were (a) to determine whether the cancer rate in the kibbutzim was elevated or abnormal and (b) to determine the role of agricultural and other relevant exposures if cancer incidence was elevated. We validated cases of cancer by kibbutz records and by surveying other information; we computed expected values on the basis of the age-sex-calendar period and site-specific cancer incidence rates reported by the Israel Cancer Registry for the entire population; and we compared the data for the 2 kibbutzim with data derived for similar age and sex groups in 2 other kibbutzim, which were assumed not to have increased cancer rates. In addition, we planned and conducted a case-referent study, including the design, pretest, and use of questionnaires, including data about lifetime exposures (i.e., type of work and its duration, agricultural and industrial chemicals, smoking and alcohol use, demographic variables, health experiences, and family history). In only one of the kibbutzim, for which high cancer rates were suspected, was there significant excess for all sites in persons who were less than 40 y of age. In one of the ""comparison"" kibbutzim, we found increased cancer rates overall. Much of the excess in the high cancer kibbutzim was in hematological cancer (i.e., leukemia and lymphoma). Multiple years of work in fields, orchards, and landscape, as well as orchard work that commenced before 1960, were associated with increased risk of cancer (p < .08). We also found an association between cancer rate and numbers of industrial chemicals used (p < .08). Pipe and cigarette smoking were also associated with increased cancer incidence. In the multivariate analysis, the association with calendar year in which orchard work was started and multiple exposures to industrial chemicals was stronger than associations noted in the univariate analyses. Although duration of agricultural work or multiple industrial exposures were clearly associated with increase in cancer risk, we were unable to identify the causal role of specific agent(s).

The benefit of allogeneic lymphocyte transfusion is limited because many patients develop graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) with prolonged pancytopenia, which sometimes proves fatal. The object of the present study was to determine the antileukemic potential and GVHD risk of in vivo-generated tumor-specific allogeneic T cells given shortly after BMT. BALB/C (H-2d) mice were inoculated with different cell doses (10(5) and 5 x 10(5)) of the A20 leukemia (BALB/C origin) 2 days prior to lethal total-body irradiation (TBI) and transplantation of allogeneic, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched DBA marrow grafts (H-2d, minor difference to BALB/C). Donors of BM grafts and T cells were allogeneic, MHC-matched mice (DBA, H-2d, minor difference to BALB/C). Donor-type T cells were generated from mice immunized with irradiated A20 leukemia cells or nonmalignant BALB/C splenocytes and restimulated in vitro. Whereas no significant immunotherapeutic effect was seen in mice with high tumor burden (5 x 10(5)), allogeneic BMT in mice inoculated with 1 x 10(5) A20 cells resulted in a modest antileukemic effect. This survival rate remained unchanged when 10(6) T cells obtained from donors immunized with nonmalignant BALB/C derived cells were given posttransplantation. In contrast, a single injection of 10(6) T cells from leukemia-immunized donors led to potent GVL effects without mediating clinically overt GVHD. Our data provide evidence for the hypothesis that minimal residual disease can be eradicated without inducing GVHD by administering small amounts of specific allogeneic cytotoxic T cells after BMT.","['Zeis, M', 'Uharek, L', 'Glass, B', 'Vosskotter, W', 'Dreger, P', 'Schmitz, N', 'Steinmann, J']","['Zeis M', 'Uharek L', 'Glass B', 'Vosskotter W', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitz N', 'Steinmann J']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Oct;26(11):1068-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanisms of p53-dependent differentiation in the monoblastic leukemia cell line U-937. These cells were transfected with a mutant of the p53 gene expressing wild-type p53 at a permissive temperature. The results showed that wild-type p53 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were able to work synergistically to promote differentiation. This cooperative response was not associated with early G1 arrest of the cell cycle, indicating that p53 can mediate differentiation by mechanisms other than those used for mediating G1 arrest. The differentiation response to transfected p53 with or without INF-gamma was inhibited by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-inducing agents (dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, forskolin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the differentiation response of p53-negative U-937 cells to 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol or all-trans retinoic acid was enhanced by cAMP-inducing agents at optimal concentrations and inhibited at higher concentrations. In addition, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-mediated differentiation could be achieved in cells arrested in G1 by concomitant incubation with cAMP-inducing agents, indicating that differentiation can occur in the absence of proliferation.

A biopsy is preferred for diagnosis before treatment can begin; however, many of these children are at risk of acute clinical deterioration and cardiovascular arrest with the induction of anesthesia. The authors noted a correlation between pleural effusions and lymphoblastic lymphoma and recently diagnosed three cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma in children with a large anterior mediastinal mass and pleural effusion through cytological and flow cytometric examination of the pleural fluid. METHODS: To focus on this problem, 101 pediatric patients presenting with an anterior mediastinal mass between January 1980 and September 1994 were reviewed to determine if pleural effusions occur more frequently at initial presentation with lymphoblastic lymphoma than with Hodgkin's disease, thus offering a means of diagnosis in children with severe respiratory compromise. The patients' chest radiographs and/or computed tomograms for the 88 cases in which they were available were reviewed retrospectively in a blinded fashion to identify those children with pleural effusions at the time of presentation. RESULTS: In this study, 71% of patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (10 of 14) had a pleural effusion at presentation, whereas only 11.7% of patients with Hodgkin's disease (7 of 60) had a pleural effusion on initial presentation. (P < .002 Fisher's Exact test). CONCLUSION: This retrospective review suggests that there is a significantly greater association of pleural effusions in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma than with Hodgkin's disease. Our experience supports the conclusion that thoracentesis may provide a means of diagnosis in children presenting in severe respiratory compromise obviating the need for anesthesia and open biopsy.","['Chaignaud, B E', 'Bonsack, T A', 'Kozakewich, H P', 'Shamberger, R C']","['Chaignaud BE', 'Bonsack TA', 'Kozakewich HP', 'Shamberger RC']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Pleural Effusion, Malignant/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3468(98)90006-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(98)90006-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1998 Sep;33(9):1355-7. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(98)90006-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective survival study based on incident cases of cancer identified by the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System and follow-up ascertained by computer record linkage to the Canadian Mortality Database. SUBJECTS: A total of 4409 patients with cancer first diagnosed at 19 years of age or younger between 1985 and 1988, and followed up to Dec. 31, 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival rates calculated at 1, 3 and 5 years according to the actuarial life table and the proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate for all cancers combined was 71%. Females with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and astrocytoma had markedly higher survival rates than their male counterparts (p < 0.05). Age at diagnosis was a significant predictor of survival among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (p < 0.01), infants having a substantially poorer prognosis than older children. Conversely, the survival rate among infants with neuroblastoma was higher than that among older children, 87% surviving for 5 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate among Canadian children and teenagers with cancer is favourable in relation to the rate among adults with cancer. Nonetheless, the 5-year survival rates for several childhood cancers remain poor (i.e., less than 65%). The survival rates among Canadian children with cancer are similar to those among children with cancer in other developed countries.","['Villeneuve, P J', 'Raman, S', 'Leclerc, J M', 'Huchcroft, S', 'Dryer, D', 'Morrison, H']","['Villeneuve PJ', 'Raman S', 'Leclerc JM', 'Huchcroft S', 'Dryer D', 'Morrison H']","['Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Toronto, Ont.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Cancer Prev Control,Cancer prevention & control : CPC = Prevention & controle en cancerologie : PCC,9709994,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Prev Control. 1998 Feb;2(1):15-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 3 severe cases associated with an acoustico facial syndrome (2 cases of herpes zoster oticus and one case after influenzae) demonstrated focal enhancement within the internal auditory canal on post contrast T1 weighted images. This enhancement involved at least 2 differents nerves. These 3 severe cases associating sensory neural hearing loss and facial palsy revealed a meningeal reaction after cerebrospinal fluid examination. The enhancement lasted a long time (up to 10 months) in one case of RAMSAY HUNT syndrome associated with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The MRI was able to confirm the anatomical reality of the vestibular neuritis and more precisely of the meningoneuritis and gave arguments for the theory of the polyneuropathy of Adour. Enhancement at MRI seems correlated with the severity of the affection (permanent vestibular areflexia in 3 cases and permanent hearing loss in 1 case).,"['Dumas, G', 'Charachon, R', 'Perret, J', 'Vasdev, A', 'Boulat, E', 'Boubagra, K']","['Dumas G', 'Charachon R', 'Perret J', 'Vasdev A', 'Boulat E', 'Boubagra K']","['Clinique ORL, CHU, Hopital A.

The authors performed a cohort study of HTLV-I infection and cause-specific mortality in 3,090 atomic-bomb survivors in Nagasaki, Japan, who were followed from 1985-1987 to 1995. The prevalence of HTLV-I seropositivity in men and women was 99/1,196 (8.3%) and 171/1,894 (9.0%), respectively. During a median follow-up of 8.9 years, 448 deaths occurred. There was one nonfatal case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (incidence rate = 0.46 cases/1,000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-2.6). After adjustment for sex, age and other potential confounders, significantly increased risk among HTLV-I carriers was observed for deaths from all causes (rate ratio [RR] = 1.41), all cancers (RR = 1.64), liver cancer (RR = 3.04), and heart diseases (RR = 2.22). The association of anti-HTLV-I seropositivity with mortality from all non-neoplastic diseases (RR = 1.40) and chronic liver diseases (RR = 5.03) was of borderline significance. Possible confounding by blood transfusions and hepatitis C/B (HCV/HBV) viral infections could not be precluded in this study. However, even after liver cancer and chronic liver diseases were excluded, mortality rate was still increased among HTLV-I carriers (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.99-1.78), especially among those with high antibody titers (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.99-2.46, P for trend = 0.04). These findings may support the idea that HTLV-I infection exerts adverse effects on mortality from causes other than adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Further studies on confounding by HCV/HBV infections and the interaction between HCV/HBV and HTLV-I may be required to analyze the increased mortality from liver cancer and chronic liver diseases.","['Arisawa, K', 'Soda, M', 'Akahoshi, M', 'Matsuo, T', 'Nakashima, E', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Saito, H']","['Arisawa K', 'Soda M', 'Akahoshi M', 'Matsuo T', 'Nakashima E', 'Tomonaga M', 'Saito H']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Nagasaki.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Factors']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505098800823 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00631.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1998 Aug;89(8):797-805. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00631.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC5921919,,,,

Several host genes, including genes of the major histocompatibility complex (H-2) and an H-2-unlinked gene, Rfv-3, influence these FV-specific immune responses. (B10.A x A/Wy)F1 mice, which have the H-2(a/a) Rfv-3(r/s) genotype, fail to mount a detectable FV-specific T-cell proliferative response but nevertheless produce FV-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and can eliminate FV viremia. Thus, this IgM response, primarily influenced by the Rfv-3 gene, may be T-cell independent. To test this idea, mice were depleted of either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell populations in vivo and were monitored for the effect on the neutralizing antibody response following FV infection. Surprisingly, mice in which CD4(+) cells were depleted showed undetectable FV-neutralizing antibody responses and high viremia levels compared to nondepleted or CD8-depleted animals. In addition to knocking out the FV antibody response, CD4(+) T-cell depletion reduced survival time significantly, further indicating the importance of CD4(+) T cells. These studies revealed the first evidence for a functional T-cell response following FV infection in these low-recovery mice and showed that CD4(+) T-helper cells are required for the Rfv-3-controlled FV antibody response.","['Super, H J', 'Brooks, D', 'Hasenkrug, K', 'Chesebro, B']","['Super HJ', 'Brooks D', 'Hasenkrug K', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/immunology', 'Viremia/genetics/immunology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.9400-9403.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):9400-3. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.9400-9403.1998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110369,,,,

This activation is mediated through interaction with the KIX domain of the cellular coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP). In this study we examined the possibility that the Tax-KIX interaction may mediate effects on cellular gene transcription in vivo, as a growing number of cellular transcription factors have been shown to utilize CBP as a coactivator. We tested the ability of Tax to deregulate the activity of the cellular transcription factor, c-Myb, since both Tax and c-Myb interact with the KIX domain of CBP. Our results show that in vivo, Tax antagonizes the transcriptional activity of c-Myb and, reciprocally, c-Myb antagonizes the transcriptional activity of Tax. Furthermore, c-Myb competes for KIX binding to Tax in vitro, indicating that these two transcription factors bind CBP in a mutually exclusive manner. This novel mechanism of transcriptional interference by Tax may promote globally deregulated cellular gene expression in the HTLV-1-infected cell, possibly leading to leukemogenesis.","['Colgin, M A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Colgin MA', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.9396-9399.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):9396-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.9396-9399.1998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110368,,,,

Within this binding domain, two hypervariable regions, VRA and VRB, have been proposed to be important for receptor recognition. In order to specifically locate residues that are important for the interaction with Pit2, we generated a number of site-specific mutations in both VRA and VRB and analyzed the resulting envelope proteins when expressed on retroviral vectors. Concurrently, we substituted portions of the amphotropic SU with homologous regions from the polytropic MuLV envelope protein. The amphotropic SU was unaffected by most of the point mutations we introduced. In addition, the deletion of eight residues in a region of VRA that was previously suggested to be essential for Pit2 utilization only decreased titer on NIH 3T3 cells by 1 order of magnitude. Although the replacement of the amino-terminal two-thirds of VRA with the polytropic sequence abolished receptor binding, smaller nonoverlapping substitutions did not affect the function of the protein. We were not able to identify a single critical receptor contact point within VRA, and we suggest that the amphotropic receptor binding domain probably makes multiple contacts with the receptor and that the loss of some of these contacts can be tolerated.","['Han, J Y', 'Zhao, Y', 'Anderson, W F', 'Cannon, P M']","['Han JY', 'Zhao Y', 'Anderson WF', 'Cannon PM']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Temperature', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.9101-9108.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):9101-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.9101-9108.1998.,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59318-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110327,,,,

These overlap the zinc finger motifs and function to provide the proper density to viral particles. There are two zinc fingers and at least two I domains within these Gag proteins. To more thoroughly characterize the important sequence features and properties of I domains, we analyzed Gag proteins that contain one or no zinc finger motifs. Chimeric proteins containing the amino-terminal half of RSV Gag and various portions of the carboxy terminus of murine leukemia virus (MLV) (containing one zinc finger) Gag had only one I domain, whereas similar chimeras with human foamy virus (HFV) (containing no zinc fingers) Gag had at least two. Mutational analysis of the MLV NC sequence and inspection of I domain sequences within the zinc-fingerless C terminus of HFV Gag suggested that clusters of basic residues, but not the zinc finger motif residues themselves, are required for the formation of particles of proper density. In support of this, a simple string of strongly basic residues was found to be able to substitute for the RSV I domains. We also explored the possibility that differences in I domains (e.g., their number) account for differences in the ability of Gag proteins to be rescued into particles when they are unable to bind to membranes. Previously published experiments have shown that such membrane-binding mutants of RSV and HIV (two I domains) can be rescued but that those of MLV (one I domain) cannot. Complementation rescue experiments with RSV-MLV chimeras now map this difference to the NC sequence of MLV. Importantly, the same RSV-MLV chimeras could be rescued by complementation when the block to budding was after, rather than before, transport to the membrane. These results suggest that MLV Gag molecules begin to interact at a much later time after synthesis than those of RSV and HIV.","['Bowzard, J B', 'Bennett, R P', 'Krishna, N K', 'Ernst, S M', 'Rein, A', 'Wills, J W']","['Bowzard JB', 'Bennett RP', 'Krishna NK', 'Ernst SM', 'Rein A', 'Wills JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Chimera/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HIV/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleocapsid/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Spumavirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.9034-9044.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):9034-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.9034-9044.1998.,,"['CA47482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA060395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA047482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110320,,,,

This T-cell decline correlates with the degree of in vitro-induced lymphocyte apoptosis. However, such a correlation has not yet been described in feline AIDS, caused by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection. We therefore investigated the intensity of in vitro-induced apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes from cats experimentally infected with a Swiss isolate of FIV for 1 year and for 6 years and from a number of long-term FIV-infected cats which were coinfected with feline leukemia virus. Purified peripheral blood lymphocytes were either cultured overnight under nonstimulating conditions or stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 for 60 h. Under stimulating conditions, the isolates from the infected cats showed significantly higher relative counts of apoptotic cells than did those from noninfected controls (1-year-infected cats, P = 0.01; 6-year-infected cats, P = 0.006). The frequency of in vitro-induced apoptosis was inversely correlated with the CD4(+) cell count (P = 0. 002), bright CD8(+) cell count (P = 0.009), and CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0. 01) and directly correlated with the percentage of bright major histocompatibility complex class II-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes (P = 0.004).

While extensive studies have identified numerous nuclear factors that can potentially bind to M-MuLV enhancer DNA in vitro, it has not been made clear which of these factors are bound in vivo. To address this problem, we carried out in vivo footprinting of the M-MuLV enhancer in infected cells by in vivo treatment with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) followed by visualization through ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) and gel electrophoresis. In vivo DMS-LMPCR footprinting of the upstream LTR revealed evidence for factor binding at several previously characterized motifs. In particular, protection of guanines in the central LVb/Ets and Core sites within the 75-bp repeats was detected in infected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, Ti-6 lymphoid cells, and thymic tumor cells. In contrast, factor binding at the NF-1 sites was found in infected fibroblasts but not in T-lymphoid cells. These results are consistent with the results of previous experiments indicating the importance of the LVb/Ets and Core sequences for many retroviruses and the biological importance especially of the NF-1 sites in fibroblasts and T-lymphoid cells. No evidence for factor binding to the glucocorticoid responsive element and LVa sites was found. Additional sites of protein binding included a region in the GC-rich sequences downstream of the 75-bp repeats (only in fibroblasts), a hypersensitive guanine on the minus strand in the LVc site (only in T-lymphoid cells), and a region upstream of the 75-bp repeats. These experiments provide concrete evidence for the differential in vivo binding of nuclear factors to the M-MuLV enhancers in different cell types.","['Granger, S W', 'Fan, H']","['Granger SW', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.8961-8970.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):8961-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.8961-8970.1998.,,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110313,,,,

Transformed (CFT1) and primary airway epithelial cells were efficiently transduced by a VSV-G-pseudotyped lacZ vector (HIT-LZ) in vitro. CFT1 cells and primary cystic fibrosis (CF) airway cell monolayers infected with a vector (HIT-LCFSN) containing human CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the absence of selection expressed CFTR, as assessed by Western blot analysis, and exhibited functional correction of CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion. In vitro studies of persistence suggested that pseudotransduction was not a significant problem with our vector preparations. In a sulfur dioxide (SO2) inhalational injury model, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation rates were measured and found to exceed 50% in SO2-injured murine tracheal epithelium. HIT-LZ vector (multiplicity of infection of approximately 10) instilled into the SO2-injured tracheas of anesthetized mice transduced 6.1% +/- 1.3% of superficial airway cells in tracheas of weanling mice (3 to 4 weeks old; n = 10), compared to 1.4 +/- 0.9% in mice 5 weeks of age (n = 4) and 0.2% in mice older than 6 weeks (n = 15). No evidence for gene transfer following delivery of HIT-LZ to tracheas of either weanling or older mice not injured with SO2 was detected. Because only a small fraction of BrdU-labeled airway cells were transduced, we examined the stability of the vector. No significant loss of vector infectivity over intervals (2 h) paralleling those of in vivo protocols was detected in in vitro assays using CFT1 cells. In summary, high-titer vectors permitted complementation of defective CFTR-mediated Cl- transport in CF airway cells in vitro without selection and demonstrated that the age of the animal appeared to be a major factor affecting in vivo retroviral transduction efficiency.","['Johnson, L G', 'Mewshaw, J P', 'Ni, H', 'Friedmann, T', 'Boucher, R C', 'Olsen, J C']","['Johnson LG', 'Mewshaw JP', 'Ni H', 'Friedmann T', 'Boucher RC', 'Olsen JC']","['Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center and Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CFTR protein, human)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0UZA3422Q4 (Sulfur Dioxide)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cystic Fibrosis/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Respiratory System/cytology/*metabolism', 'Sulfur Dioxide/toxicity', 'Trachea/drug effects/injuries/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.8861-8872.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):8861-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.8861-8872.1998.,,"['HL42384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53680/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54832/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110303,,,,

Tax activity is mediated by interaction with cellular transcription factors including members of the CREB/ATF family, the NF-kappaB/c-Rel family, serum response factor, and the coactivators CREB binding protein-p300. Although p53 is usually not mutated in HTLV-1-infected T cells, its half-life is increased and its function is impaired. Here we report that transient coexpression of p53 and Tax results in the suppression of p53 transcriptional activity. Expression of Tax abrogates p53-induced G1 arrest in the Calu-6 cell line and prevents the apoptosis induced by overexpressing p53 in the HeLa/Tat cell line. The Tax mutants M22 and G148V, which selectively activate the CREB/ATF pathway, exert these same biological effects on p53 function. In contrast, the NF-kappaB-active Tax mutant M47 has no effect on p53 activity in any of these systems. Consistent with the negative effect of Tax on p53, no activity on a p53-responsive promoter was observed upon transfection of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. The p53 protein is expressed at high levels in the nucleus, and nuclear extracts of HTLV-1-infected T cells bind constitutively to a DNA oligonucleotide containing the p53 response element, indicating that Tax does not interfere with p53 binding to DNA. Tax is able to suppress the transactivation function of p53 in three different cell lines, and this suppression required Tax-mediated activation of the CREB/ATF, but not the NF-kappaB/c-Rel, pathway. Tax and the active Tax mutants were able to abrogate the G1 arrest and apoptosis induced by p53, and this effect does not correlate with an altered localization of nuclear p53 or with the disruption of p53-DNA complexes. The suppression of p53 activity by Tax could be important in T-cell immortalization induced by HTLV-1.","['Mulloy, J C', 'Kislyakova, T', 'Cereseto, A', 'Casareto, L', 'LoMonico, A', 'Fullen, J', 'Lorenzi, M V', 'Cara, A', 'Nicot, C', 'Giam, C', 'Franchini, G']","['Mulloy JC', 'Kislyakova T', 'Cereseto A', 'Casareto L', 'LoMonico A', 'Fullen J', 'Lorenzi MV', 'Cara A', 'Nicot C', 'Giam C', 'Franchini G']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. jmulloy@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",1998/10/10 00:00,1998/10/10 00:01,['1998/10/10 00:00'],"['1998/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.11.8852-8860.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Nov;72(11):8852-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.11.8852-8860.1998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110302,,,,

Rex is a nuclear phosphoprotein that directly binds to its cis-acting Rex response element RNA target sequence and constantly shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, Rex induces nuclear accumulation of unspliced viral RNA. Three protein domains which mediate nuclear import-RNA binding, nuclear export, and Rex oligomerization have been mapped within the 189-amino-acid Rex polypeptide. Here we identified a different region in the carboxy-terminal half of Rex which is also required for biological activity. In inactive mutants with mutations that map within this region, as well as in mutants that are deficient in Rex-specific multimerization, Rex trans activation could be reconstituted by fusion to a heterologous leucine zipper dimerization interface. The intracellular trafficking capabilities of wild-type and mutant Rex proteins reveal that biologically inactive and multimerization-deficient Rex mutants are still efficiently translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This observation indicates that multimerization is essential for Rex function but is not required for nuclear export.

Here, we demonstrate that Crm1 is indeed able to interact with active but not defective forms of the HIV-1 Rev NES and of NESs found in other retroviral nuclear export factors. In addition, we demonstrate that Crm1 can bind the Rev NES when Rev is assembled onto the Rev response element RNA target and that Crm1, like Rev, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. Crm1 also specifically binds the Rev NES in vitro, although this latter interaction is detectable only in the presence of added Ran . GTP. Overexpression of a truncated, defective form of the nucleoporin Nup214/CAN, termed DeltaCAN, that retains Crm1 binding ability resulted in the effective inhibition of HIV-1 Rev or human T-cell leukemia virus Rex-dependent gene expression. In contrast, DeltaCAN had no significant affect on Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element (MPMV CTE)-dependent nuclear RNA export or on the expression of RNAs dependent on the cellular mRNA export pathway. As a result, DeltaCAN specifically blocked late, but not early, HIV-1 gene expression in HIV-1-infected cells. These data strongly validate Crm1 as a cellular cofactor for HIV-1 Rev and demonstrate that the MPMV CTE nuclear RNA export pathway uses a distinct, Crm1-independent mechanism.

This compound was only moderately antiproliferative toward CCRF-CEM lymphocytic leukemia cells in culture, but induced apoptosis after long incubation times. Slightly greater potency was observed in CEM cells adapted to grow in low folate media. Cell cycle alterations induced by LY354899 were unique relative to antifolates that inhibit either the purine or thymidine de novo biosynthetic pathways. Based on the observed changes in DNA content, we hypothesized that inhibition of the dehydrogenase resulted in two temporally distinct events: the first was a purineless-like effect and the second was a thymineless-like effect that resulted in apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we combined LY354899 with the purine salvage metabolite, hypoxanthine. This combination resulted in an earlier and more dramatic apoptotic response, indicating that the thymineless effect had been potentiated. Biochemical analysis of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates confirmed that inhibition of the dehydrogenase activity initially resulted in decreased pools of deoxypurines and deoxypyrimidines, followed 16 hr later by an increase in deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and a further decrease in deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP). These studies demonstrate that the inhibition of the dehydrogenase activity of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase may represent a viable target for the development of novel antifolates.

For a variety of these transcription factors the ability to physically recruit auxiliary proteins, denoted corepressors, is crucial for the ability to silence gene expression. We and others have previously implicated the SMRT corepressor in the actions of the PLZF transcription factor and in the function of its oncogenic derivative, PLZF-retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha), in promyelocytic leukemia. We report here that PLZF, and a structurally similar transcriptional repressor, BCL-6, can interact with a variety of corepressor proteins in addition to SMRT, including the mSin3A protein and (for PLZF) histone deacetylase-1. Unexpectedly, these additional interactions with corepressor components are nonequivalent for these otherwise similar oncoproteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression by BCL-6 and by PLZF may differ in mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the oncogenic PLZF-RARalpha chimera lacks several important corepressor interaction sites that are present in the native PLZF protein. Thus the t(11;17) translocation that creates the PLZF-RARalpha chimera generates an oncoprotein with potentially novel regulatory properties distinct from those of either parental protein. Our results demonstrate that otherwise similar transcription factors can differ notably in their interactions with the corepressor machinery.","['Wong, C W', 'Privalsky, M L']","['Wong CW', 'Privalsky ML']","['Section of Microbiology, Division of Biological Sciences, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.42.27695 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59723-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 16;273(42):27695-702. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.42.27695.,,"['R01 DK-53528/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA-53394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, receptor antagonists for interleukin-6-type cytokines have been constructed that still bind to the specific ligand binding subunit of the receptor complex, but have lost the ability to stimulate gp130. Such receptor antagonists compete for a specific receptor of a member of the cytokine family. Interleukin-6 only binds to gp130 when complexed with the interleukin-6 receptor that exists as a membrane bound and soluble molecule. Here we have constructed fusion proteins that consist of the soluble form of the human interleukin-6 receptor covalently linked to interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. These fusion proteins directly bind to gp130. Moreover, at concentrations of 10-50 nM they completely neutralize not only the biological activity of interleukin-6 but also of other cytokines of the interleukin-6-type family that act via gp130 homodimers or gp130/LIF-R heterodimers. Therefore, these gp130 targeting cytokine antagonists might be useful therapeutic tools in disease states that are related to cytokines of the interleukin-6 family.","['Renne, C', 'Kallen, K J', 'Mullberg, J', 'Jostock, T', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Rose-John, S']","['Renne C', 'Kallen KJ', 'Mullberg J', 'Jostock T', 'Grotzinger J', 'Rose-John S']","['I.

HsORC5p is precipitated from cell extracts with HsORC2p and HsORC4p, indicating that it is part of the putative human ORC. The bulk of HsORC5p is in an insoluble nuclear fraction, whereas the other known human ORC subunits (HsORC1p, HsORC2p, and HsORC4p) are easily extracted in the nuclear-soluble fractions and in S100 (HsORC1p). In addition, we identified an alternatively spliced mRNA from the same locus (HsORC5T). HsORC5Tp also formed a complex with HsORC4p but not with HsORC2p, suggesting it may play a regulatory role in the assembly of different ORC subcomplexes. HsORC5, HsORC5T, and HsORC4 transcripts are abundant in spleen, ovary, and prostate in addition to tissues with high levels of DNA replication like testes and colon mucosa, implicating the human ORC proteins in functions besides DNA replication.

The dicistronic retroviral vector contains a multiple cloning site followed by the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (EMCV-IRES) and a green fluorescent protein gene. This design allows for 5'-cap dependent translation of any gene of interest and 5'-cap independent translation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a single dicistronic RNA. The culture model consists of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants grown in defined medium. Under these conditions the Schwann cell population is selectively expanded and infected by the retroviral vector, allowing for rapid transfer of genes of interest selectively to a large percentage of Schwann cells in coculture with neurons. Infected cells are subsequently identified in living cultures by their expression of GFP. Infected (GFP expressing) Schwann cells in contact with neurites continued to exhibit: (1) increased mitotic activity, (2) increased sensitivity to elevate intracellular calcium in response to extracellular application of ATP, and (3) myelination.

Here, we demonstrate that curcumin also induces apoptosis in human basal cell carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphologic change. In our study, consistent with the occurrence of DNA fragmentation, nuclear p53 protein initially increased at 12 h and peaked at 48 h after curcumin treatment. Prior treatment of cells with cycloheximide or actinomycin D abolished the p53 increase and apoptosis induced by curcumin, suggesting that either de novo p53 protein synthesis or some proteins synthesis for stabilization of p53 is required for apoptosis. In electrophoretic mobility gel-shift assays, nuclear extracts of cells treated with curcumin displayed distinct patterns of binding between p53 and its consensus binding site. Supportive of these findings, p53 downstream targets, including p21(CIP1/WAF1) and Gadd45, could be induced to localize on the nucleus by curcumin with similar p53 kinetics. Moreover, we immunoprecipitated extracts from basal cell carcinoma cells with different anti-p53 antibodies, which are known to be specific for wild-type or mutant p53 protein. The results reveal that basal cell carcinoma cells contain exclusively wild-type p53; however, curcumin treatment did not interfere with cell cycling. Similarly, the apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 and promoter Bax were not changed with the curcumin treatment. Finally, treatment of cells with p53 antisense oligonucleotide could effectively prevent curcumin-induced intracellular p53 protein increase and apoptosis, but sense p53 oligonucleotide could not. Thus, our data suggest that the p53-associated signaling pathway is critically involved in curcumin-mediated apoptotic cell death. This evidence also suggests that curcumin may be a potent agent for skin cancer prevention or therapy.","['Jee, S H', 'Shen, S C', 'Tseng, C R', 'Chiu, H C', 'Kuo, M L']","['Jee SH', 'Shen SC', 'Tseng CR', 'Chiu HC', 'Kuo ML']","['Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proteins/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/genetics/pharmacology']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00352.x [doi]', 'S0022-202X(15)40241-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1998 Oct;111(4):656-61. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00352.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA binding domain (ETS domain) of Fli-1 is fused to the RNA binding domain of EWS by t(11q24:22q12) chromosomal translocation in Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Screening of human cDNA libraries has identified two different 5'-termini and alternatively spliced forms of the human Fli-1 gene (Fli-1b), suggesting the possible existence of two independent promoters. The genomic sequence adjacent to the alternate exon of human Fli-1b gene shows functional promoter activity when cloned in promoter-less CAT expression vector and transfected into QT-6 cells. The transcription initiation (CAP) site and minimum promoter region necessary for function were localized. The 5'-flanking regions of human Fli-1b and mouse Fli-1 show 80% homology suggesting conserved promoter regulatory elements. The Fli-1b 5'-flanking sequence lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes but contains a partially conserved TATA-like sequence at position 242. Several transcription factor binding sequences like ATF/CREB, E2A-PBX1, EBP, PEA-3, ETS-2, Sp-1, c-Myc, TBP, GATA-1 and Oct-3 were conserved in the promoter sequence. Functional promoter assays revealed that Fli-1b promoter shows very strong transcriptional activation compared to Fli-1 promoter. We also showed that variant Fli-1b has transcriptional activation properties similar to those of Fli-1. Fli-1b and Fli-1 show differential expression in various hematopoietic cell lines. This differential expression and promoter activities of Fli-1 and Fli-1b suggests that several mechanisms are involved in Fli-1 gene regulation which are mediated by many transcription factors.","['Dhulipala, P D', 'Lee, L', 'Rao, V N', 'Reddy, E S']","['Dhulipala PD', 'Lee L', 'Rao VN', 'Reddy ES']","['Department of Human Genetics, Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'TATA Box/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/metabolism']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202030 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Sep 3;17(9):1149-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202030.,,"['CA 51083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 58642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first stage results in rapid expansion of pre-leukemic proerythroblasts (FVA cells) dependent on erythropoietin (Epo) for differentiation and survival in vitro. The second stage is characterized by emergence of erythroleukemic clones (MEL cells) which typically bear activation of the ets-oncogene, PU.1/spi.1, and loss of functional p53. We developed a Friend virus-sensitive, p53-deficient mouse model to investigate the biological advantage conferred by p53-loss during tumor progression. Here we report p53 was not required for cell survival or growth arrest during differentiation of FVA cells, nor was p53 required for induction of apoptosis upon Epo withdrawal. However, we detected induction of the p21Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene during differentiation, which was markedly enhanced in the presence of p53. p53-dependent expression of p21Cip1 occurred in the absence of an increase in p53 mRNA and protein levels and was specific for p21Cip1, since expression of gadd45, mdm-2, cyclin G and bax were unaffected by p53. In contrast, treatment of FVA cells with DNA damaging agents led to rapid accumulation of p53 protein resulting in transcription of multiple p53-regulated genes, leading to either apoptosis or growth arrest, depending on the agent used. These data demonstrate that p53-dependent activities during differentiation of preleukemic erythroblasts are distinct from those observed in response to genotoxic agents. We propose that enhancement of p53-dependent gene expression during differentiation may represent a tumor suppressor function which is necessary to monitor differentiation of preleukemic cells and which is selected against during tumor progression.","['Kelley, L L', 'Hicks, G G', 'Hsieh, F F', 'Prasher, J M', 'Green, W F', 'Miller, M D', 'Eide, E J', 'Ruley, H E']","['Kelley LL', 'Hicks GG', 'Hsieh FF', 'Prasher JM', 'Green WF', 'Miller MD', 'Eide EJ', 'Ruley HE']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Genes, p53/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202037 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Sep 3;17(9):1119-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202037.,,"['5P30CA42014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50DK49219/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA69169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of the seven patients who had previously failed cyclophosphamide mobilization achieved more than the target yield. Rehospitalization incidence was significantly lower in patients receiving 1.6 g m(-2) etoposide than in those receiving 2.0 g m(-2) (P = 0.03). These data suggest that high-dose etoposide with G-CSF is an efficient mobilization regimen in the majority of heavily pretreated patients, including those who have previously failed on high-dose cyclophosphamide with G-CSF. An etoposide dose of 1.6 g m(-2) appears to be as effective as higher doses but less toxic.","['Kanfer, E J', 'McGuigan, D', 'Samson, D', 'Abboudi, Z', 'Abrahamson, G', 'Apperley, J F', 'Chilcott, S', 'Craddock, C', 'Davis, J', 'MacDonald, C', 'Macdonald, D', 'Olavarria, E', 'Philpott, N', 'Rustin, G J', 'Seckl, M J', 'Sekhar, M', 'Stern, S', 'Newlands, E S']","['Kanfer EJ', 'McGuigan D', 'Samson D', 'Abboudi Z', 'Abrahamson G', 'Apperley JF', 'Chilcott S', 'Craddock C', 'Davis J', 'MacDonald C', 'Macdonald D', 'Olavarria E', 'Philpott N', 'Rustin GJ', 'Seckl MJ', 'Sekhar M', 'Stern S', 'Newlands ES']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine at Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Choriocarcinoma/therapy', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Germinoma/therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.603 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Oct;78(7):928-32. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.603.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2063139,,,,

To substitute the autocrine activity by a single physiological component, 28 cytokines, growth factors and biomodulators were tested [interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, stem cell factor (SCF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), acid fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), IGF-2, insulin, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), oncostatin, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), angiogenin, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), erythropoietin (EPO), interferon alpha (INF-alpha), INF-gamma, transferrin, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and bovine serum albumin for control reasons]. In these experiments, only TNF-alpha and TNF-beta rapidly induced apoptosis. TNF-alpha and TNF-receptor 1 were expressed by N.1 cells, and the secretion of TNF-alpha was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Autocrine factor-triggered apoptosis was inhibited when conditioned supernatant was preincubated with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. These findings suggested that the apoptosis-inducing component of the N.1 autocrine activity was TNF-alpha. In the presence of antisense c-myc oligonucleotides, induction of cell death by autocrine factor was partly inhibited. Autocrine factor and TNF-alpha stimulated transcription of the invasiveness-related protease plasminogen activator/urokinase mRNA (upa) with similar kinetics. When N.1 cells were exposed to purified plasminogen activator/urokinase protein (uPA), cell matrix contact was disrupted. Thus, uPA might serve a physiological role during TNF-induced apoptosis by affecting the interactions between cells and the basal membrane, thereby facilitating anoikis. This mechanistic study, which was restricted to a single human ovarian carcinoma model cell line (N.1), provides evidence that N.1 maintains the capacity to undergo c-myc-dependent apoptosis by the TNF-TNF-receptor pathway, and no additional pharmacological stimuli for induction of apoptosis are required.","['Simonitsch, I', 'Krupitza, G']","['Simonitsch I', 'Krupitza G']","['Institute of Clinical Pathology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Autocrine Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Communication', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.594 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Oct;78(7):862-70. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.594.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2063124,,,,

IL-6, TNF-alpha, and LIF levels in the culture medium were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were stimulated by hCG in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulation of IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels by 500 IU/ml of hCG increased their production by 3.7- and 2.8-fold, respectively (P < 0.05). Stimulation of IL-6 by 100 IU/ml of hCG was also significant (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant effect of hCG on LIF secretion by endometrial cells (P = 0.31).

METHODS: Misclassification of wire codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories of wire code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category of wire code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories of wire code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications of wire codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0.89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each of the wire code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories of wire code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification of categories of wire code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on wire codes because of misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes of the wire code range. The lack of an association between high categories of wire code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure of the wire code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area.","['Tarone, R E', 'Kaune, W T', 'Linet, M S', 'Hatch, E E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Robison, L L', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Wacholder, S']","['Tarone RE', 'Kaune WT', 'Linet MS', 'Hatch EE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Robison LL', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Wacholder S']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Bias', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Electric Wiring/classification', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/10/09 02:01,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/10/09 02:01'],"['1998/10/09 02:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 02:01 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.55.5.333 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1998 May;55(5):333-9. doi: 10.1136/oem.55.5.333.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1757581,,,,

Mortality from non-respiratory cancers.,325-32,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the mortality from non-respiratory cancers by work area among active and retired male workers of the German rubber industry. METHODS: A cohort of 11,633 male German workers was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1991. Cohort members were active (n = 7536) or retired (n = 4127) on 1 January 1981 and had been employed for at least one year in one of five study plants producing tyres or technical rubber goods. Work histories were reconstructed from routinely documented ""cost centre codes"" and classified into six categories: I preparation of materials; II production of technical rubber goods; III production of tyres; IV storage and dispatch; V general service; VI others. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), controlling for age and calendar year and stratified by work area (employment in respective work area for at least one year) and time related variables (year of hire, lagged years of employment in work area) were calculated from national mortality rates as the reference. RESULTS: Significant increases in mortality were found for pharyngeal cancer in work area IV (three deaths, SMR 486, 95% CI 101 to 1419), oesophageal cancer in work area III (11 deaths, SMR 227, 95% CI 114 to 407), and leukaemia in work areas I (11 deaths, SMR 216; 95% CI 108 to 387) and II (14 deaths, SMR 187; 95% CI 102 to 213). Furthermore, increased SMRs were found for stomach cancer in work area I (22 deaths, SMR 134; 95% CI 84 to 203), colon cancer in work area II (27 deaths, SMR 131, 95% CI 86 to 191), prostatic cancer in work area V (27 deaths, SMR 152, 95% CI 99 to 221), and bladder cancer in work areas IV (six deaths, SMR 253; 95% CI 93 to 551) and V (12 deaths, SMR 159, 95% CI 82 to 279).

Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with relapse or progressive disease were given chemo- and/or radiotherapy and the response was evaluated after 90 days. Fifty-four patients (24%) obtained a complete remission and 44 patients (19%) partial remission. The overall median survival after relapse was five months. In the group who received salvage treatment the median survival was seven months, and for the 54 patients in complete remission the median survival was 15 months.

Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed after each dobutamine infusion of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min. Although left ventricular mass was decreased and end-systolic walls stress increased in the patient group when compared with the control subjects (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), no differences were found between shortening fraction and ejection force in control subjects and patients, at rest and during each dobutamine infusion. A decreased mitral E/A ratio (ratio of early-to-late peak filling velocity) was demonstrated in anthracycline-treated patients only during dobutamine infusion (p < 0.01).

DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Public Health Services, South-East Utrecht, the Netherlands. METHOD: Data on the numbers of new cancer patients in Odijk over the period 1985/'96 were obtained from general practitioners, from the Integral Cancer Centre Mid-Netherlands (IKMN) and from the Foundation Dutch Study Group Leukaemia in Children. The classifications were according to age and to distance from the home to the high-voltage cable. The electric and magnetic field strengths in dwellings situated less than 28 m from the cable were calculated. RESULTS: Cancer was diagnosed in 131 patients in the period 1985/'96, 127 adults and four children. The cases in 3 of 4 children occurred in the period 1993/'96. Over the period 1990-1994, the registered cancer incidence did not deviate from the expected incidence in the IKMN region, nor from the mean incidence in the Netherlands. Neither for adults nor for children was a relationship found between cancer and living in the vicinity of the high-voltage cable. The exposure to the electric field of persons living in houses near the cable was maximally 7%, and exposure to the magnetic field maximally 6.5% of the maximal liminal values applied in the Netherlands on recommendation of the Health Council.

CBFA2 forms a fusion gene with ETO and MDS1/EVI1 in translocations in myeloid leukemia and with ETV6(TEL) in the t(12;21) common in childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We have analyzed samples from 30 leukemia patients who had chromosome rearrangements involving 21q22 by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Our analysis showed that 7 of them involved CBFA2 and new translocation partners. Two patients had a t(17;21)(q11.2;q22), whereas the other 5 had translocations involving 1p36, 5q13, 12q24, 14q22, or 15q22. Five of these novel breakpoints in CBFA2 occurred in intron 6; this same intron is involved in the t(3;21). One breakpoint mapped to the t(8;21) breakpoint region in intron 5, and 1 mapped 5' to that region. All 7 CBFA2 rearrangements resulted from balanced translocations. All 7 patients had myeloid disorders (acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome); 2 were de novo and 5 had treatment histories that included topoisomerase II targeting agents. The association of therapy-related disorders with translocations involving CBFA2 was significant by Fisher's exact test (P < .003). These results provide further evidence that this region of CBFA2 is susceptible to breakage in cells exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors.","['Roulston, D', 'Espinosa, R 3rd', 'Nucifora, G', 'Larson, R A', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rowley, J D']","['Roulston D', 'Espinosa R 3rd', 'Nucifora G', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, and the Cancer Research Center, The University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/10/09 02:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/10/09 02:00'],"['1998/10/09 02:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 02:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76208-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 15;92(8):2879-85.,,"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

By DNA fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a barcode of probes covering the DH, JH, and CH genes, the configuration of the entire CH region can be visualized on single DNA molecules. Using this technique, we have studied class switching in three types of B-cell neoplasia, mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL), representing B cells in, respectively, pregerminal center, germinal center, and postgerminal center stages of development. In MCL and FL, simultaneous detection of the t(11;14) and t(14;18) breakpoint with probes for the BCL-1 and BCL-2 loci, respectively, allowed differentiation between productive and nonproductive alleles. In none of 10 MCL cases was class switching detected. In 21 HCL, all nonimmunoglobulin M (IgM) cases had class-switch deletion consistent with the expressed isotype on at least one allele. In FL, however, a peculiar pattern of CH rearrangement was observed. In IgM expressing FL, the translocated alleles had switched in 11 of 13 cases, and the nontranslocated allele showed complex rearrangements downstream from the Cmu-Cdelta genes in 9 of 13 cases. These downstream rearrangements may reflect tumor-specific deregulation of the class-switch machinery. All seven immunoglobulin G (IgG) expressing FL showed class switching on both alleles. Fiber FISH analysis also showed several polymorphisms. The most frequent one, present on 38% of all analyzed alleles, consisted of an extra Cgamma gene or pseudogene in the 3' cluster.","['Vaandrager, J W', 'Schuuring, E', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Dyer, M J', 'Raap, A K', 'Kluin, P M']","['Vaandrager JW', 'Schuuring E', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Dyer MJ', 'Raap AK', 'Kluin PM']","['Department of Pathology, Hematology, Cytometry and Cytochemistry, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Using HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by all-trans retinoic acid (RA), we have investigated the expression and regulation of TOPO II isozymes as well as the levels of topoisomerase I (TOPO I). During RA-induced differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells, levels of TOPO I remained unchanged, whereas the levels and phosphorylation of TOPO IIalpha and TOPO IIbeta proteins were increased twofold to fourfold and fourfold to eightfold, respectively. The elevation of TOPO II (alpha and beta) protein levels and phosphorylation was apparent at 48 hours of treatment with RA and persisted through 96 hours. The increased level of TOPO IIbeta protein was also detected in differentiated cells subsequently cultured for 96 hours in RA-free medium. Pulse chase experiments in cells labeled with 35S-methionine showed that the rate of degradation of TOPO IIbeta protein in control cells was about twofold faster than that in the differentiated RA-treated cells. The level of decatenation activity of kDNA was comparable in nuclear extracts from control or RA-treated cells. Whereas etoposide (1 to 10 micromol/L) -induced DNA cleavage was not significantly different, apoptosis was significantly lower (P = .012) in RA-treated versus control cells after exposure to 10 micromol/L etoposide. Consistent with unaltered levels of TOPO I, camptothecin (CPT) -induced DNA cleavage was similar in control or RA-treated cells. However, apoptosis after exposure to 1 to 10 micromol/L CPT was significantly lower (P = .003 to P < .001) in RA-treated versus control cells. Results suggest that TOPO IIbeta protein levels are posttranscriptionally regulated and that degradation of TOPO IIbeta is decreased during RA-induced differentiation. Furthermore, whereas the total level of TOPO II (alpha + beta) is increased with RA, the level of TOPO II catalytic activity and etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavage activity remains unaltered. Thus, TOPO IIbeta may have a specific role in transcription of genes involved in differentiation with RA treatment.","['Aoyama, M', 'Grabowski, D R', 'Isaacs, R J', 'Krivacic, K A', 'Rybicki, L A', 'Bukowski, R M', 'Ganapathi, M K', 'Hickson, I D', 'Ganapathi, R']","['Aoyama M', 'Grabowski DR', 'Isaacs RJ', 'Krivacic KA', 'Rybicki LA', 'Bukowski RM', 'Ganapathi MK', 'Hickson ID', 'Ganapathi R']","['Experimental Therapeutics Program, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76206-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 15;92(8):2863-70.,,['CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

Studies in red blood cells (RBC) have shown that TPMT expression displays genetic polymorphism with 11% of individuals having intermediate and one in 300 undetectable levels. The genetic basis for this polymorphism has now been elucidated and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays described for the most common mutations accounting for reduced activity. In previous studies, genotype has been correlated with red blood cell activity. In this report, we describe the relationship between genotype and TPMT activity measured directly in the target of drug action, the leukemic cell. We have demonstrated that the TPMT activity in lymphoblasts from 38 children and adults found by PCR to be homozygotes (*1/*1) was significantly higher than that in the five heterozygotes (*1/*3) detected (median, 0.25 v 0.08, P < .002, Mann-Whitney U). Similar results were obtained when results from children were analyzed separately. However, comparison of activity in blasts from AML and ALL showed a higher level in the former (0.35 v 0.22 nU/mg, P < .002, n = 17, 35), suggesting that factors other than genotype may also influence expression.","['Coulthard, S A', 'Howell, C', 'Robson, J', 'Hall, A G']","['Coulthard SA', 'Howell C', 'Robson J', 'Hall AG']","['LRF Molecular Pharmacology Specialist Programme, Cancer Research Unit, Medical School, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics', 'Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76205-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 15;92(8):2856-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

These patients were analyzed for presenting features and treatment outcome to identify specific prognostic factors. Treatment stratification was based on initial cell mass and early response as determined by blast count in peripheral blood after a 7-day induction prephase with prednisone and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate on day 1. All patients were treated by similar intensive Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocols. The median age of Ph+ patients was 7.5 years, the median white blood cell count (WBC) was 75 x 10(9)/L, 77% of patients had common ALL, and 29% coexpressed myeloid markers. After a median observation time of 4.2 years, 29 of 61 patients are alive (survival probability [pSUR] at 4 years, 0.49; standard error [SE], 0.06), and 24 of 61 are in first complete remission (CR1; probability of event-free survival [pEFS] at 4 years, 0.38; SE, 0.06). Twenty (35%) of 57 evaluable patients had >/=1,000 leukemic blasts per microliter of blood on day 8 of induction (defined as prednisone-poor-response [PPR]). These patients were older (10.0 v 6.88 years; P = .02) and had a higher WBC (144 v 29 x 10(9)/L; P = .0016) as compared with patients with prednisone good response (PGR; <1,000 blasts/microL at day 8). Only 2 of 20 patients (10%) with PPR remained in CR1 and alive: 6 patients with PPR did not survive after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) due to recurring disease (n = 3) and toxicity (n = 3), and 12 nontransplanted patients died due to progression (n = 5) or relapse (n = 7). In contrast, 26 (70%) of the 37 patients with PGR are alive. Of 18 patients transplanted by allo-BMT, 1 relapsed (now in CR2) and 4 died after BMT. Among the 19 patients with PGR treated by chemotherapy alone, 8 remained in CR1 and 11 relapsed, of which 4 are in CR2 or CR3. The prednisone response emerged as the only independent prognostic factor for survival in Cox regression analysis. Thus, two thirds of Ph+ childhood ALL cases can be identified early by PGR, which, when treated with intensive BFM chemotherapy, with or without BMT, have a significantly lower risk of treatment failure. With a median continuous complete remission (CCR) time of 4.1 years, pEFS for PGR is 0.55 (SE, 0.08) compared with 0.10 (SE, 0.07) in patients with PPR (P = .0001). PGR is also an indicator for treatment responsiveness and durable second remission after relapse, which in turn may provide a second chance for BMT.","['Schrappe, M', 'Arico, M', 'Harbott, J', 'Biondi, A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Conter, V', 'Reiter, A', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Gadner, H', 'Basso, G', 'Bartram, C R', 'Lampert, F', 'Riehm, H', 'Masera, G']","['Schrappe M', 'Arico M', 'Harbott J', 'Biondi A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Conter V', 'Reiter A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Gadner H', 'Basso G', 'Bartram CR', 'Lampert F', 'Riehm H', 'Masera G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany. schrappe.martin@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76192-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 15;92(8):2730-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

The European APL Group.",2712-8,"All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) syndrome is a life-threatening complication of uncertain pathogenesis that can occur during the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by ATRA. Since its initial description, however, no large series of ATRA syndrome has been reported in detail. We analyzed cases of ATRA syndrome observed in an ongoing European trial of treatment of newly diagnosed APL. In this trial, patients 65 years of age or less with an initial white blood cell count (WBC) less than 5,000/microL were initially randomized between ATRA followed by chemotherapy (CT) (ATRA-->CT group) or ATRA with CT started on day 3; patients with WBC greater than 5,000/microL received ATRA and CT from day 1; patients aged 66 to 75 received ATRA-->CT. In patients with initial WBC less than 5, 000/microL and allocated to ATRA-->CT, CT was rapidly added if WBC was greater than 6,000, 10,000, 15,000/microL by days 5, 10, and 15 of ATRA treatment. A total of 64 (15%) of the 413 patients included in this trial experienced ATRA syndrome during induction treatment. Clinical signs developed after a median of 7 days (range, 0 to 35 days). In two of them, they were in fact present before the onset of ATRA. In 11 patients, they occurred upon recovery from the phase of aplasia due to the addition of CT. Respiratory distress (89% of the patients), fever (81%), pulmonary infiltrates (81%), weight gain (50%), pleural effusion (47%), renal failure (39%), pericardial effusion (19%), cardiac failure (17%), and hypotension (12%) were the main clinical signs, and 63 of the 64 patients had at least three of them. Thirteen patients required mechanical ventilation and two dialysis. A total of 60 patients received CT in addition to ATRA as per protocol or based on increasing WBC; 58 also received high dose dexamethasone (DXM); ATRA was stopped when clinical signs developed in 30 patients. A total of 55 patients (86%) who experienced ATRA syndrome achieved complete remission (CR), as compared with 94% of patients who had no ATRA syndrome (P = .07) and nine (14%) died of ATRA syndrome (5 cases), sepsis (2 cases), leukemic resistance (1 patient), and central nervous system (CNS) bleeding (1 patient). None of the patients who achieved CR and received ATRA for maintenance had ATRA syndrome recurrence. No significant predictive factors of ATRA syndrome, including pretreatment WBC, could be found. Kaplan Meier estimates of relapse, event-free survival (EFS), and survival at 2 years were 32% +/- 10%, 63% +/- 8%, and 68% +/- 7% in patients who had ATRA syndrome as compared with 15% +/- 3%, 77% +/- 2%, and 80% +/- 2% in patients who had no ATRA syndrome (P = .05, P = .003, and P = .03), respectively. In a stepwise Cox model that also included pretreatment prognostic variables, ATRA syndrome remained predictive for EFS and survival. In conclusion, in this multicenter trial where CT was rapidly added to ATRA in case of high or increasing WBC counts and DXM generally also used at the earliest clinical sign, the incidence of ATRA syndrome was 15%, but ATRA syndrome was responsible for death in only 1.2% of the total number of patients treated.

In the previous study, we purified an apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to homogeneity from a medium conditioned by PDBu-treated HL-60 cells. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that AIF is identical to endothelial interleukin-8 (IL-8). A novel apoptosis system, in which endothelial cells participate via endothelial IL-8 release, is identified here. Human umbilical vein cells (VE cells) produce and secrete IL-8 by stimulation of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha. Endothelial IL-8, which is secreted from VE cells by stimulation of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha , induces apoptosis in myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 cells. Monocyte-derived IL-8 could not induce apoptosis in K562 cells. Moreover, interaction between VE cells and K562 cells induces the release of endothelial IL-8 from VE cells, and the attached K562 cells undergo apoptosis. Moreover, interactions between VE cell and other cell lines, such as HL-60, U937, Jurkat, and Daudi, induce the secretion of endothelial IL-8 and the induction of apoptosis in cell lines. Endothelial IL-8 significantly inhibits tumor growth of intraperitoneal and subcutaneous tumor mass of K562 cells and induces apoptosis in their cells in vivo. Endothelial IL-8 plays an important role in apoptosis involving endothelial cells, which may provide us with a new therapy for hematological malignancies.","['Terui, Y', 'Ikeda, M', 'Tomizuka, H', 'Kasahara, T', 'Ohtsuki, T', 'Uwai, M', 'Mori, M', 'Itoh, T', 'Tanaka, M', 'Yamada, M', 'Shimamura, S', 'Ishizaka, Y', 'Ikeda, K', 'Ozawa, K', 'Miura, Y', 'Hatake, K']","['Terui Y', 'Ikeda M', 'Tomizuka H', 'Kasahara T', 'Ohtsuki T', 'Uwai M', 'Mori M', 'Itoh T', 'Tanaka M', 'Yamada M', 'Shimamura S', 'Ishizaka Y', 'Ikeda K', 'Ozawa K', 'Miura Y', 'Hatake K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells/pathology', 'K562 Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins']",1998/10/09 00:00,1998/10/09 00:01,['1998/10/09 00:00'],"['1998/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76184-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 15;92(8):2672-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

Negative feedback control mediated by erythropoietin and thrombopoietin regulates erythrocyte and platelet production, respectively, but the regulation of leukocyte levels is less well understood. The local regulatory mechanisms within the hematopoietic stem cells are also not well characterized at this point. Because of their dynamic character, cyclical neutropenia and other periodic hematological disorders offer a rare opportunity to more fully understand the nature of these regulatory processes. We review the salient clinical and laboratory features of cyclical neutropenia (and the less common disorders periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia, periodic auto-immune hemolytic anemia, polycythemia vera, aplastic anemia, and cyclical thrombocytopenia) and the insight into these diseases afforded by mathematical modeling. We argue that the available evidence indicates that the locus of the defect in most of these dynamic diseases is at the stem cell level (auto-immune hemolytic anemia and cyclical thrombocytopenia seem to be the exceptions).

Moreover, ADR induces numerous mitochondrial modifications in sensitive cells. However, no results have yet been obtained as to the repercussions of drug effects on oxido-reductase activities in ADR-resistant cells. To analyze mitochondrial damage induced by ADR treatment, we investigated lactate content, oxygen consumption, respiratory chain activities, and cytochrome content in ADR-sensitive K562 cells and two ADR-resistant variants (K562/R0.2 and K562/R0.5 cells). Biochemical investigations in ADR-resistant cells showed several mitochondrial modifications (in comparison to the parental cell line) according to the variant line and the physiologic state. More particularly, in K562/R0.5 cells cytochrome c (cyt c) oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1) activity and cytochrome aa3 content dramatically decreased since cells enter into the stationary phase. Regardless of the number of multidrug-resistant cell subcultures in ADR-free medium, the cytochrome c oxidase activity in the stationary phase remained unchanged, indicating an irreversible effect of the drug. These alterations could correspond to several modifications of the nuclear and/or mitochondrial genome(s) following acquisition of the ADR resistance phenotype by K562 cells.","['Denis-Gay, M', 'Petit, J M', 'Mazat, J P', 'Ratinaud, M H']","['Denis-Gay M', 'Petit JM', 'Mazat JP', 'Ratinaud MH']","['Institut de Biotechnologie, Faculte des Sciences, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/08 00:00,1998/10/08 00:01,['1998/10/08 00:00'],"['1998/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00084-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00084-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Aug 15;56(4):451-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00084-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we compare the susceptibility of two murine cell lines (SR-4987 stromal cells and L1210 leukemic cells) to inhibitory effect of cholera toxin (CT) on cell growth and correlate their sensitivity to CT with ganglioside content and intracellular cAMP accumulation. The results indicate a very different response of the two cell lines to CT treatment. L1210 cells (which contain GM1a ganglioside) are sensitive to the inhibiting activity of CT (IC50 in the clonogenic assay = 10(-9) M) but no cAMP accumulation was observed after the treatment. SR-4987 cells (which lack GM1a) show a dramatic increase of intracellular cAMP without any inhibition of cell growth following the CT treatment until 10(-8) M. However, after SR4987 cells have incorporated GM1a they became susceptible to CT (with a IC50 value = 10(-11) M). The comparison of these results with our previous studies on WEHI-3B leukemia cells confirms the remarkable heterogeneity of cell sensitivity to the growth inhibition by CT by emphasizing that this inhibition is the final event of very different mechanisms in which CT binding to a specific ganglioside seems to be necessary and sufficient whereas cAMP accumulation may not be coupled with the antiproliferative effect of CT.","['Pessina, A', 'Mineo, E', 'Neri, M G', 'Piccirillo, M', 'Valore, L', 'Giulani, A']","['Pessina A', 'Mineo E', 'Neri MG', 'Piccirillo M', 'Valore L', 'Giulani A']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/metabolism', 'Gangliosides/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/08 00:00,1998/10/08 00:01,['1998/10/08 00:00'],"['1998/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1998 Sep;44(6):933-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When marked cytologic atypia is present, a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm is readily made; however, the distinction between a low-grade malignant neoplasm and a reactive process is much more difficult. If unfixed tissue is available, immunohistologic or genotypic methods that are usually aimed at defining B-lymphocytic monotypism can be applied. However, paraffin-embedded tissue has generally been deemed unsuitable for these techniques. We assessed the value of a panel of immunohistochemical stains and a seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the analysis of lymphoid infiltrates in routinely processed GI biopsy specimens from 49 archival cases, including morphologically benign, indeterminate, and overtly malignant lesions. Clinical outcome was used as the retrospective diagnostic standard; end points were death (of lymphomatous disease or otherwise) and clinical evidence of lymphoma. According to light microscopic criteria, 19 cases were classified as benign, 17 as malignant, and 13 as atypical. Immunophenotyping correctly identified 28 of 31 benign and 14 of 18 malignant lesions (7 cases had an indeterminate immunoprofile). Genotypic analysis correctly identified 12 of 18 malignant and 29 of 31 benign lesions, but spurious monoclonal bands were produced by PCR amplification of 2 of the latter 31 cases. No single technique exists for correct categorization of all paraffin-embedded specimens of GI lymphoid infiltrates.

METHODS: The cohort included 328,846 children younger than 5 years born to women enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid at any time between the last menstrual period (LMP) and the date of delivery. The cohort was identified by linking files of Tennessee Medicaid mothers ages 15-44 years and children and the children's birth and death certificates for the period January 1, 1975 through December 31, 1992. Exposure data were obtained from Medicaid pharmacy records and exposure was defined as filling a metronidazole prescription that had at least a day's supply between the 30 days prior to the LMP and the date of delivery. Study cases were cohort children diagnosed with a first primary cancer before age 5 years, identified by linking the cohort with a statewide childhood cancer database for the study period. RESULTS: Cohort members contributed 1,172,696 person-years of follow-up for analysis, with children exposed (8.1%) and not exposed (91.9%) in utero to metronidazole contributing 79,716 and 1,092,980 person-years, respectively. Of 952 children younger than 5 years in the statewide cancer database, 175 met study eligibility criteria. Of these, 42 had leukemia, 30 had central nervous system (CNS) tumors, 28 had neuroblastoma, and 75 had other cancers. Using Poisson regression modeling, children exposed to metronidazole in utero had no significant increase in adjusted relative risk (RR) for all cancers (RR: 0.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.41-1.59), leukemia (no exposed case), CNS tumors (RR: 1.23; 95% CI, 0.29-5.21), neuroblastomas (RR: 2.60; 95% CI, 0.89-7.59), and other cancers (RR: 0.57; 95% CI, 0.18-1.82).

CONCLUSIONS: This regimen was active in adults younger than 60 years with untreated acute myeloid leukemia and normal, simple, or complex karyotypes. Remission duration was confounded by karyotype. Mucosal toxicity limited the tolerability of this regimen. These adverse effects might be overcome by increasing the intensity of postremission therapy and modifying the dosing schedule.","['Bow, E J', 'Gallant, G', 'Williams, G J', 'Woloschuk, D', 'Shore, T B', 'Rubinger, M', 'Schacter, B A']","['Bow EJ', 'Gallant G', 'Williams GJ', 'Woloschuk D', 'Shore TB', 'Rubinger M', 'Schacter BA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Manitoba, the Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'A1TA934AKO (Xylose)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xylose']",1998/10/08 02:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/08 02:01'],"['1998/10/08 02:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/08 02:01 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981001)83:7<1344::AID-CNCR11>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Oct 1;83(7):1344-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Downregulation of bcl-2 mRNA levels did not result from actions of OA on the bcl-2 upstream negative response element. Nuclear run-off analyses confirmed that OA did not affect bcl-2 gene transcription. However, OA caused a rapid increase in the rate of degradation of bcl-2 mRNA. Therefore, OA induces down-regulation of bcl-2 expression via destabilization of its transcript. The constitutive action of an OA-sensitive protein phosphatase may therefore maintain HL60 cell survival by blocking bcl-2 mRNA degradation.","['Riordan, F A', 'Foroni, L', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Mehta, A B', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Riordan FA', 'Foroni L', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Mehta AB', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free Hospital Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Okadaic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",1998/10/08 00:00,1998/10/08 00:01,['1998/10/08 00:00'],"['1998/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(98)01070-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01070-9 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1998 Sep 18;435(2-3):195-8. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01070-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case report.,1895-9,"STUDY DESIGN: Report of a patient with a rare location of a solid chronic lymphocytic leukemic mass of an intervertebral lumbar disc. OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the previously undescribed discovertebral involvement of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to discuss the diagnostic difficulties. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia primarily involves lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Bone lesions are rare in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and usually consist of areas of osteopenia. Spinal involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is rare, and only two cases of spinal cord compression attributable to an extradural solid mass composed of leukemic cells have been reported. Intervertebral disc involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia has not been reported previously. METHODS: The clinical findings, radiographs, histology, treatment, and follow-up results are presented. RESULTS: Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging studies showed partial collapse of vertebrae L2 and L3, with destruction and protrusion of the intervertebral disc L2-L3 with dura compression. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy followed by en bloc resection of vertebrae L2 and L3 stabilized with stackable cages and anterior fixation with Kaneda bars. Intervertebral disc infiltration with leukemic cells of B-cell origin was confirmed through histologic examination and immunohistochemical studies of a biopsy and resection specimen. Twenty months after treatment the patient was still in remission and fully mobilized. CONCLUSIONS: Intervertebral disc involvement in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is rare. Its presence should be considered in patients with back pain and neurologic symptoms who had been treated for this form of leukemia in the past. Differentiation with infectious spondylodiscitis can be difficult. Histology is necessary to confirm diagnosis.","['Jiya, T U', 'Van Royen, B J', 'Sugihara, S', 'Van Diest, P Y', 'Manoliu, R A', 'Wuisman, P I']","['Jiya TU', 'Van Royen BJ', 'Sugihara S', 'Van Diest PY', 'Manoliu RA', 'Wuisman PI']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Spine,7610646,,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Intervertebral Disc/*pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology/surgery', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Spinal Fusion']",1998/10/08 00:00,1998/10/08 00:01,['1998/10/08 00:00'],"['1998/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007632-199809010-00020 [doi]'],ppublish,Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 1998 Sep 1;23(17):1895-9. doi: 10.1097/00007632-199809010-00020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is certainly true for childhood malignancies and leukaemia but evidence that significantly improved survival is occurring in the common solid tumours is lacking. Since 1963 the University of Liverpool Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery has collected data on all patients with head and neck tumours presenting to the department. The present study investigates patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the four main sites: larynx, hypopharynx, oral cavity and oropharynx. From 1963 until the end of 1989, 2738 patients were seen by the department and from 1990 a further 717 patients have been seen. Since 1990 patients have tended to be in better general physical condition but, on the other hand, have tended to have more advanced disease at the primary site. The department has latterly tended to see fewer laryngeal cancers and more cancers of the oropharynx. Significantly fewer patients have presented with neck node metastases. Multiple logistic regression suggests that the most significant difference between the two groups is the great reduction in neck node recurrence rates in the group of patients seen since 1990 (P = 0.0001). The recurrence of tumours at the primary site since 1990 has been 35% compared with 41% before 1990, and recurrence in the neck nodes since 1990 has been 12%, compared with 15% before 1990. These differences are significant (P = 0.0141 and P = 0.0494, respectively). When studying survival in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the 5-year cure rate was 50%, whereas since 1990 the figure has risen to 60% tumour-specific 5-year survival--a significant difference. A similar effect was noted in observed survival. This improvement in cure rate occurred for all four main sites. The results were confirmed by Cox's proportional hazards model where year of treatment was highly significantly associated with improved survival (P = 0.0001). It has been demonstrated that locoregional recurrence has improved since 1990 and this is reflected in improved survival figures. Although there are differences in the parameters of tumours referred before 1990 and since 1990, multivariate analysis suggests that the improvement in neck node recurrence rates may be responsible for this improved survival rate. Multivariate analysis for survival also suggests that the improvement in cure rates is independent of compounding variables and dependent on the year of presentation of the tumour. This improved survival may be related to factors, such as the administration of radical postoperative radiotherapy.","['Jones, A S', 'Houghton, D J', 'Beasley, N J', 'Husband, D J']","['Jones AS', 'Houghton DJ', 'Beasley NJ', 'Husband DJ']","['University of Liverpool Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,Clinical otolaryngology and allied sciences,7701793,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*mortality/secondary/therapy', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/trends', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1998/10/08 00:00,1998/10/08 00:01,['1998/10/08 00:00'],"['1998/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2273.1998.00146.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci. 1998 Aug;23(4):319-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2273.1998.00146.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CP-PGs) are powerful antiproliferative endogenous substances that may act as electrophilic regulating compounds, by virtue of the presence of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring. Nevertheless, differential resistance to CP-PG cytotoxic/cytostatic effect has been reported in different cell types. It is reported that the activity/expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis) can be inducibly activated by electrophiles, including CP-PGs. The response of the human cancer strains HEp-2 (larynx carcinoma) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) cells to treatment with the CP-PG PGA1 in culture was investigated by evaluating the time-course of GSH synthesis and activity of enzymes of GSH metabolism, other than gamma-GCS, after PGA1 addition. HEp-2 cells, being more resistant to PGA1 cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, have basal GSH levels that were 2.4-fold higher than that of HL-60 cells. The activities of GSH S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GSRd) and glutathione peroxidase (GSPx) are constitutively higher in HL-60 cells than in HEp-2 cells (respectively, 17.0-, 28.5- and 12.3-fold). When challenged with PGA1, both cell types exhibited a dose-dependent rise in GSH content that was maximal 18 h after PGA1 addition and was preceded by a rise in GST and GSRd activities in both cell types (at 12 h). GSPx activity increased only in HEp-2 (PGA1 evoked a 93.4%-inhibition in HL-60 cells). Moreover only HEp-2 cells exhibited early capacity to enhance GSH content (1-2 h just after PGA1 addition). These results and earlier data showing that leukemia cells are sensitive to CP-PG treatment suggest that deficiencies in GSH metabolism may be strategically in therapeutic approaches to the treatment of human leukemias.","['de Bittencourt, P I Jr', 'Miyasaka, C K', 'Curi, R', 'Williams, J F']","['de Bittencourt PI Jr', 'Miyasaka CK', 'Curi R', 'Williams JF']","['Department of Physiology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. pauloivo@vortex.ufrgs.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/08 02:01,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/10/08 02:01'],"['1998/10/08 02:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/10/08 02:01 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15216549800203472 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1998 Sep;45(6):1255-64. doi: 10.1080/15216549800203472.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have measured the total lipid content in separated lymphoid cells and several tumour cell lines, among which, T-cell leukaemia, monocytic leukaemia, melanoma, fibrosarcoma, lung carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma are included.

Commercially available alpha-satellite DNA probes specific for the centromere regions of chromosome 8 and chromosome 12, respectively, were used. After application of the Fast-FISH protocol, and microscopic images of the fluorescence-labelled cell nuclei were recorded by the true color CCD camera Kappa CF 15 MC and evaluated quantitatively by computer analysis on a PC. These results were compared to results obtained from the same type of specimens using the same analysis system but with a standard FISH protocol. In addition, automated spot counting after both FISH techniques was compared to visual spot counting after standard FISH. A total number of about 3,000 cell nuclei was evaluated. For quantitative brightness parameters, a good correlation between standard FISH labelling and Fast-FISH was found. Automated spot counting after Fast-FISH coincided within a few percent to automated and visual spot counting after standard FISH. The examples shown indicate the reliability and reproducibility of Fast-FISH and its potential for automatized interphase cell diagnostics of numerical chromosome aberrations. Since the Fast-FISH technique requires a hybridization time as low as 1/20 of established standard FISH techniques, omitting most of the time consuming working steps in the protocol, it may contribute considerably to clinical diagnostics.

No data on their simulataneous effects are available. Similarities to human AIDS induced early by Friend leukemia complex (FLC) and its replication competent helper Rowson-Parr virus (RPV) provides a mouse model to study drug-virus action. Leukemia susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice were infected, then at time intervals their nylon wool-separated splenocytes were exposed to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for 3h. Natural killer (NK) cell activity against Yac-1 cells was assayed by 51Cr-release for 4 and 18h. Recovery of splenocytes was found to be suppressed by FLC, but in BALB/c only by RPV. After a transient enhancement in C57BL/6 by FLC, NK cell activity of both mice became suppressed early (2 to 4 days), normalized subsequently and enhanced late (11 to 14 days) postinfection. A moderate increase in BALB/c, no change in C57BL/6 were induced by low (1-2.5 microgram/ml) THC doses. NK cell activity of BALB/c became suppressed exponentially by higher (5-10 microgrtam/ ml) THC doses in 18h as compared to 4h assays, while its proportional and moderate impairment was seen in C57BL/6. The magnitude of NK cell activity of infected mice was determined by THC: enhancement or impairment followed those of untreated, infected counterparts, but on the level of THC-treated cells. Low doses hardly, high doses additively influenced NK cells of infected BALB/c.

However, a predictable pattern of apoptosis is observed in adult kidney in two settings, during which parts of the developmental pattern are recapitulated. These are regeneration following acute ischemic injury and the process of cystogenesis in polycystic kidney disease. Apoptosis in kidney is regulated by agents both intrinsic and extrinsic to the renal cell. The protooncogene b-cell lymphoma/leukemia gene product-2 (bcl-2) is an important intrinsic factor. The growth factor epidermal growth factor is an important extrinsic regulator. A thorough understanding of the control of renal apoptosis during development and recovery from ischemic injury and in cystogenesis may lead to new therapies to prevent or ameliorate abnormalities of kidney formation, to enhance regeneration following acute ischemic injury, and to slow the progression of renal failure in polycystic kidney disease.","['Hammerman, M R']",['Hammerman MR'],"[""George M.

A few years later the poor Jewish family emigrated to the United States. Lempert obtained his MD degree at Long Island Medical College, and soon after that established a small hospital of his own in Manhattan. Later he bought an old five-storey building and converted it into a new otological medical center, which he called Endaural Hospital. His life was rather difficult with the wave of antisemitism in the United States and the adversity which he encountered so many times. However his contribution to the microsurgical treatment of conductive deafness is immense. He elaborated and introduced a new method of mastoidectomy and, first of all, fenestration--a new one-stage surgical technique to be applied in cases of otosclerosis. This precise, sophisticated operation revolutionized surgical treatment. With a dentist's drill Lempert created a new window on the horizontal canal, in this way the sound wave could stimulate the inner ear. He was to call it ""fenestration nov-ovalis"". Lempert was never a member of any ENT society and worked in his hospital alone. When suddenly his only son was stricken with leukemia and died, Lempert was completely broken, and never returned to this work. The next blows were new operative methods of otosclerosis: stapes mobilisation introduced by Rosen and stapedectomy by Shea. He never accepted these new techniques. It was a painful experience for a surgical genius who had at so many times been hurt during his life. He could not believe that his fenestration was definitely gone. Lempert quickly deteriorated physically and mentally, and died in 1958.","['Pietruski, J']",['Pietruski J'],,['pol'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Portrait']",Poland,Otolaryngol Pol,Otolaryngologia polska = The Polish otolaryngology,0404453,,IM,"['Fenestration, Labyrinth/*history/methods', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Otolaryngology/history', 'Otosclerosis/history/surgery', 'Poland', 'United States']",1998/10/07 00:00,1998/10/07 00:01,['1998/10/07 00:00'],"['1998/10/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Otolaryngol Pol. 1998;52(3):341-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,Juliusz Lempert (1890-1958)--tworca fenestracji.,,,,,['Lempert J'],"['Lempert, J']",

We observed that during this process, both protein and mRNA levels for PARS markedly decreased in U937 cells. Through deletion analysis of the PARS regulatory gene, we found that the sequence within the first intron region was responsible for the TPA-dependent repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Southwestern blot analysis indicate that this element bound specifically to a nuclear protein. TPA treatment abolished the binding of the protein in U937 cells but not in HeLa cells. DNase I footprinting data show that the cis regulatory element is located between residues 328 and 383. We further examined the function of this cis element (BS207) in a basal promoter regulatory reporter construct and found that this cis element (BS207) functions as an enhancer via the binding of an unknown trans-acting factor. TPA treatment diminished the binding activity of the factor in U937 cells, resulting in a decrease in the enhanced activity to the basal level. These results suggest that abolishment of the binding of a special nuclear protein to the first intron of the PARS gene is related to the TPA-responsive downregulation of PARS in U937 cells.","['Nie, J', 'Ota, K', 'Morisawa, K', 'Auer, B', 'Schweiger, M', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Nie J', 'Ota K', 'Morisawa K', 'Auer B', 'Schweiger M', 'Taniguchi T']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Medical Research Center, Kochi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*drug effects', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",1998/10/07 00:00,1998/10/07 00:01,['1998/10/07 00:00'],"['1998/10/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi980859h [doi]', 'bi980859h [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Oct 6;37(40):14181-8. doi: 10.1021/bi980859h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rare ALL cases the Ph chromosome may appear in leukemic cells during the course of the disease. We report here the case of a 5.5-year-old male patient with T-ALL who was found to have the b2a2 BCR-ABL mRNA transcript by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at first marrow relapse. At the time of initial diagnosis, no BCR-ABL transcripts had been detected by PCR in the patient's blood and marrow samples. Further studies were performed using a competitive PCR titration assay and the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method to monitor the leukemic clone. Progression of the disease was associated with a higher BCR-ABL transcript level and an increasing proportion of BCR-ABL-positive cells. Metaphase FISH analysis identified the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene on a normal chromosome 22. This study shows that a late-appearing Ph translocation in ALL may be cytogenetically invisible. Quantitative RT-PCR and FISH techniques are appropriate and efficient methods for detecting these rare ALL variants expressing the BCR-ABL fusion gene and for estimating the level of residual disease following treatment.","['Tchirkov, A', 'Bons, J M', 'Chassagne, J', 'Schoepfer, C', 'Kanold, J', 'Briancon, G', 'Giollant, M', 'Malet, P', 'Demeocq, F']","['Tchirkov A', 'Bons JM', 'Chassagne J', 'Schoepfer C', 'Kanold J', 'Briancon G', 'Giollant M', 'Malet P', 'Demeocq F']","['Laboratoire de Cytogenetique Medicale, Faculte de Medecine, Clermont-Ferrand, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Child', 'Cytogenetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male']",1998/10/06 00:00,1998/10/06 00:01,['1998/10/06 00:00'],"['1998/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050412 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Jul-Aug;77(1-2):55-9. doi: 10.1007/s002770050412.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal aberrations in addition to trisomy 21 have only rarely been described. In many cases of infant acute leukemia band q23 of chromosome 11 is involved in nonrandom translocations, often resulting in a rearrangement of the ALL-1 (MLL, HRX, HTRX 1) gene. Generally, this translocation carries a bad prognosis. We describe two newborn girls with Down syndrome and TMD in whom the constitutional trisomy 21 was combined with an acquired abnormality of chromosome 11. During the TMD the morphological and immunologic features were consistent with those of megakaryoblastic leukemia. The chromosome 11 abnormalities were del(ll)(q23), but rearrangements of the ALL-1 gene were not found. Our patients had remissions that occurred spontaneously or after a mild chemotherapy. The important finding is that additional chromosomal changes may occur during TMD in Down syndrome. The fact that the abnormality was in region 11q23 raises the question of whether the risk for developing leukemia is increased under these conditions.","['Granzen, B', 'Bernhard, B', 'Reinisch, I', 'Skopnik, H', 'Mertens, R']","['Granzen B', 'Bernhard B', 'Reinisch I', 'Skopnik H', 'Mertens R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Technical University of Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*genetics']",1998/10/06 00:00,1998/10/06 00:01,['1998/10/06 00:00'],"['1998/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050411 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Jul-Aug;77(1-2):51-4. doi: 10.1007/s002770050411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, all imaging techniques have to be repeated in cases of suspected fungal infection. Therefore, use of the CT or MRI scan is limited. Only ultrasound (US) examinations can be repeated as often as needed. The disadvantage of US is a lack of sufficient documentation. We analyzed the value of computer-assisted documentation in serial ultrasonography of leukemia patients with suspected chronic disseminated candidiasis. From November 1996 until October 1997, a total of 220 ultrasound examinations (Kranzbuhler Logiq 500, 3.5 MHz convex array) were performed in 58 patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Initial US pictures were stored on a personal computer and compared with the live US at the time of reevaluation in cases of persistent fever. Ultrasound detected microabscesses in liver and/or spleen in eight of the 58 patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy/biopsy (n = 6), blood culture (n = 1), and a significant Candida antibody titer (n = 1). Focal lesions occurred only after neutrophil recovery. However, a newly evolving nonhomogeneous, micronodular pattern of liver and spleen occurred during febrile neutropenia in three patients, and two of these developed focal lesions subsequently. Follow-up was easy, since US pictures could be compared directly with stored examinations on screen. We conclude that serial US is sensitive in detecting microabscesses in the liver or the spleen. Computer-assisted US documentation proved to be a helpful tool for detection as well as in the follow-up of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis.","['Karthaus, M', 'Huebner, G', 'Elser, C', 'Geissler, R G', 'Heil, G', 'Ganser, A']","['Karthaus M', 'Huebner G', 'Elser C', 'Geissler RG', 'Heil G', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Candidiasis/complications/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/standards', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Liver/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Spleen/diagnostic imaging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color']",1998/10/06 00:00,1998/10/06 00:01,['1998/10/06 00:00'],"['1998/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050409 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Jul-Aug;77(1-2):41-5. doi: 10.1007/s002770050409.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the control human bone marrow cells from four adults and nine children who had localized malignancy and histologically normal-looking marrow. TPO alone effectively stimulated megakaryocyte colony formation, and interleukin-3 (IL-3) synergized this. In 17 patients (13 adults and four children) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis, TPO stimulated leukemic colony formation in only one patient with FAB M7 subtype. In 11 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis, TPO did not enhance leukemic colony formation. After 17 courses of induction chemotherapy, nine for AML and eight for ALL, TPO stimulated megakaryocyte colony formation to a level of 51%, of that in the control human bone marrow cells. This may suggest that the administration of TPO to patients with M7 subtype warrants caution, whereas it is probably safe to give TPO at any time to patients with ALL.

Parent RBL2H3 cells, expressing autoactivated c-kit, readily adhered to Fn-coated surface, developed typical leukocyte adhesion machinery (podosome), and migrated toward Fn without cytokine priming, thus provided a simple experimental system to analyze Fn-mediated outside-in signaling. While overexpression of Csk or the Csk mutants did not significantly affect cell adhesion to the Fn surface or alpha5 integrin recruitment to the attachment sites, Csk suppressed and mCsk almost abolished Fn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, filamentous actin assembly to podosomes, and cell migration, but mCsk(-) did not. Coexpression of LynA devoid of C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine in mCsk cells successfully restored Fn-mediated podosome formation and cell migration. Coexpression of c-Src lacking the C-terminal tyrosine reconstructed podosomes, but could not restore the cell migration regardless of its expression level. Collectively, these observations provide evidence that Src family protein tyrosine kinases are required, and that Lyn could transmit sufficient signal for Fn-mediated cytoskeletal changes leading to cell locomotion in RBL2H3 cells, and they suggest that Lyn and c-Src are differentially involved in cell motility.","['Suzuki, T', 'Shoji, S', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Nada, S', 'Okada, M', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Honda, Z']","['Suzuki T', 'Shoji S', 'Yamamoto K', 'Nada S', 'Okada M', 'Yamamoto T', 'Honda Z']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.23 (CSK protein, human)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Movement/genetics/*immunology', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",1998/10/06 00:00,1998/10/06 00:01,['1998/10/06 00:00'],"['1998/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Oct 1;161(7):3694-701.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells became refractory in terms of the junB gene response to exposure to a second round of LPS or lipid A, but not to PMA. The LPS-induced desensitized state was not due to the shortening of the half-life of junB mRNA, but was suggested, by nuclear run-on analysis, to be caused by reduction of junB gene transcription. Pretreating cells with herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, substantially inhibited LPS-induced expression of junB mRNA and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of 38- to 42-kDa proteins, which comigrated with p38 and p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Parallel to down-regulation of junB mRNA expression, activation of the p38 MAP kinase was markedly reduced in LPS-tolerant cells, whereas activation of p42 MAP kinase was relatively constant. The specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB202190, potently inhibited LPS-induced junB mRNA expression. These results suggest that the LPS-induced desensitization of junB gene expression occurs at or upstream of the level of gene transcription and may be involved in a defective LPS-induced p38 MAP kinase pathway.","['Fujihara, M', 'Ikebuchi, K', 'Maekawa, T L', 'Wakamoto, S', 'Ogiso, C', 'Ito, T', 'Takahashi, T A', 'Suzuki, T', 'Sekiguchi, S']","['Fujihara M', 'Ikebuchi K', 'Maekawa TL', 'Wakamoto S', 'Ogiso C', 'Ito T', 'Takahashi TA', 'Suzuki T', 'Sekiguchi S']","['Japanese Red Cross, Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Genes, jun/drug effects/*immunology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/genetics/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1998/10/06 00:00,1998/10/06 00:01,['1998/10/06 00:00'],"['1998/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Oct 1;161(7):3659-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemokines produced play a critical role in the polarization and recruitment of NK cells as well as in the NK effector-target cell conjugate formation. Chemokines induce the formation of two specialized regions in the NK cell: the advancing front or leading edge, where chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 cluster, which might guide the cells toward the chemotactic source, and the uropod, where adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and -3 are redistributed. NK cell polarity was intrinsically involved in conjugate formation. The redistribution of both adhesion receptors and CCR was preserved during the formation of NK-target cell conjugates. Time-lapse videomicroscopy studies of the formation of effector-target conjugates showed that morphologic poles are also functionally distinct; while the binding to target cells was preferentially mediated through the leading edge, the uropod was found at the rear of migrating NK cells and recruited additional NK cells to the vicinity of K562 target cells. Inhibition of cell polarization and adhesion receptor redistribution blocked the formation of NK-K562 cell conjugates and the cytotoxic activity of NK cells.

In the present study we demonstrate that hyporesponsiveness of CLL-B cells can be overcome by stimulatory pathways mediated by activated CD4(+) T cells. In contrast to CD40 ligation, costimulation with activated T cells promotes a proliferative response in CLL-B cells identical to that in normal B cells. Furthermore, coculture with activated T cells improved survival of CLL-B cells in vitro. Differentiation of CLL-B cells into IgM producing cells was promoted, as well. However, the capacity for IgM secretion remained impaired compared to that of normal B cells. For T-cell-mediated B cell activation direct cellular contact with activated T helper cells is absolutely required. Prevention of CD40/CD40L interaction by CD40 antibody caused only partial inhibition of B cell activation, suggesting that additional signals are involved in T-B cell interaction. Whereas interruption of the ligand pairs CD11a/CD54, CD5/CD72, CD27/CD70 had no influence, the addition of CD58 antibody completely inhibited B cell activation by activated T cells. In costimulation with cellular signals the presence of B-cell-tropic cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-4, was required to optimize B-CLL proliferation, as demonstrated by the use of neutralizing antibodies. We conclude from these results that proliferative hyporesponsiveness by CLL-B cells can be circumvented by antigen-nonspecific signals in addition to CD40 which are mediated by direct contact with activated T helper cells.","['Tretter, T', 'Schuler, M', 'Schneller, F', 'Brass, U', 'Esswein, M', 'Aman, M J', 'Huber, C', 'Peschel, C']","['Tretter T', 'Schuler M', 'Schneller F', 'Brass U', 'Esswein M', 'Aman MJ', 'Huber C', 'Peschel C']","['Third Department of Medicine, The Johannes Gutenberg University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",1998/10/06 00:00,1998/10/06 00:01,['1998/10/06 00:00'],"['1998/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(98)91360-0 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1998.1360 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1998 Oct 10;189(1):41-50. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1998.1360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

In the current study, we tested the hypotheses that Axl expression would parallel neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid, and that Axl expression would be regulated by growth factors present at sites of vascular injury. Ribonuclease protection assay showed dynamic increases in Axl mRNA in vessels, with peak expression 7 and 14 days after injury. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed these results and demonstrated that Axl protein expression was localized primarily to cells of the neointima after injury. Northern blot analysis indicated increased mRNA expression for the secreted Axl ligand, Gas6, in injured carotids, with a time course paralleling that of Axl upregulation. Axl and Gas6 expression were temporally correlated with neointima formation, suggesting a role for Axl signaling in this process. Other studies, performed in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells, revealed positive regulation of Axl mRNA expression by thrombin or angiotensin II but not by basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, or transforming growth factor-ss1. Western blot analysis confirmed these results, showing that Axl protein expression was specifically increased by thrombin or angiotensin II.

Although serious infections after fludarabine therapy have been described, a systematic analysis of the risk factors for such infections in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for major infection in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine. DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records. SETTING: Cancer center. PATIENTS: 402 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia not previously treated or treated with chlorambucil (with or without prednisone) who received fludarabine (30 mg/m2 of body surface area per day for 5 days) with or without prednisone at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: Infections occurred more often in previously treated (144 of 248 [58%]) than in previously untreated (53 of 154 [34%]) patients (P < 0.001). Listeriosis or pneumocystosis occurred in 12 of 170 (7%) previously treated patients receiving fludarabine plus prednisone, 0 of 78 previously treated patients receiving fludarabine alone, and 2 of 154 (1%) previously untreated patients receiving fludarabine plus prednisone (P = 0.003). Univariate analysis identified previous chemotherapy, advanced disease, failure to respond to fludarabine, elevated serum beta2-microglobulin level (P < 0.001), low serum albumin level (P = 0.024), elevated serum creatinine concentration (P = 0.008), and low granulocyte count (P = 0.003) as risk factors for infection. Multivariate analysis identified Rai stage III or IV (odds ratio, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.17 to 3.94]), previous treatment (odds ratio, 2.24 [CI, 1.43 to 3.51]), and elevated serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio, 1.98 [CI, 1.09 to 3.67]) as statistically significant independent risk factors for major infection.

Five (26%) of 19 patients with a CD4 count less than 50 cells/mL developed cutaneous zoster compared with 9 (6%) of 139 patients with a CD4 count greater than 50 cells/mL (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine used in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be associated with infections involving T-cell dysfunction, such as listeriosis, pneumocystosis, mycobacterial infections, and opportunistic fungal and viral infections. Prophylaxis or presumptive therapy should be initiated in the appropriate setting.","['Anaissie, E J', 'Kontoyiannis, D P', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Robertson, L', 'Lerner, S', 'Keating, M J']","['Anaissie EJ', 'Kontoyiannis DP', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Robertson L', 'Lerner S', 'Keating MJ']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Opportunistic Infections/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-129-7-199810010-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1998 Oct 1;129(7):559-66. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-129-7-199810010-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured the serum levels of PTHrP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and calcium in three patients with hypercalcemia due to leukemia. RESULTS: Serum levels of PTHrP, LDH and calcium were elevated at admission in all patients, and these levels were reduced to within the normal range after chemotherapy. However, normalization of serum PTHrP concentration occurred more rapidly than normalization of serum LDH levels after chemotherapy. The increase in serum PTHrP concentration accompanied leukemic cell proliferation and preceded the increases in serum LDH and calcium. Serum LDH concentration increased, but serum PTHrP concentration did not after administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that serum PTHrP may be a more useful marker than serum LDH or calcium in assessing the status of leukemic patients with hypercalcemia.","['Oda, N', 'Nakai, A', 'Hayashi, R', 'Hayakawa, N', 'Hamada, M', 'Kojima, K', 'Tsuzuki, M', 'Matui, T', 'Ino, M', 'Hirano, M', 'Iwase, K', 'Itoh, M', 'Nagasaka, A']","['Oda N', 'Nakai A', 'Hayashi R', 'Hayakawa N', 'Hamada M', 'Kojima K', 'Tsuzuki M', 'Matui T', 'Ino M', 'Hirano M', 'Iwase K', 'Itoh M', 'Nagasaka A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis', 'Calcium/blood', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reference Values']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/eje.0.1390323 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 1998 Sep;139(3):323-9. doi: 10.1530/eje.0.1390323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the supernatant was obtained from a PMN suspension cultured with opsonized plantar SC, higher THP-1 chemotactic activity was detected as compared with that cultured with non-opsonized SC. Although some concentrations of the chemokines, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta, were detected in supernatants obtained from the PMN suspensions cultured with plantar SC than in the control suspensions of PMN alone, their production by PMN was not influenced by the opsonization procedure. In contrast, MCP-1 was found to be secreted from PMN suspensions constitutively, showing no correlation to this THP-1 chemotactic activity. Moreover, HPLC analysis of PMN suspensions indicated that factors with far higher molecular weight values than these chemokines are involved in the chemotaxis of THP-1 cells.","['Ozawa, M', 'Terui, T', 'Tanita, M', 'Kato, T', 'Tagami, H']","['Ozawa M', 'Terui T', 'Tanita M', 'Kato T', 'Tagami H']","['Department of Dermatology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', '*Complement Activation', 'Epidermis/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0625.1998.tb00316.x [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 1998 Aug;7(4):151-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.1998.tb00316.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 24 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders diagnosed by laparoscopic techniques included 14 patients with a new diagnosis of lymphoma and 10 patients with recurrent disease; pathologic findings were diagnostic of diffuse large cell lymphoma (11 patients), follicular lymphoma (11 patients), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1 patient), and lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease (1 patient). Previous abdominal cytologic or core-needle biopsy specimens from 11 lymphoma patients did not yield an unequivocal diagnosis or subtype of lymphoma. The 11 patients (22%) in whom laparoscopic techniques did not produce a tissue sample needed laparotomy (10 patients) or femoral lymph node biopsy (1 patient) to document the diagnosis of large cell lymphoma (2 patients), follicular lymphoma (5 patients), composite lymphoma (1 patient), myeloma (1 patient), neurofibroma (1 patient), and reactive lymph nodes (1 patient).

Undesired side-effects are the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the occurrence of pancytopenia in some patients. In a pilot study, we investigated if unmanipulated G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells which naturally contain large numbers of T lymphocytes (D-PBSC/LI) would be equally effective or even superior than DLI in generating a graft-versus-leukemia reaction (GVL) but could mitigate or prevent the development of pancytopenia. We treated 12 patients with CML chronic phase (n = 5), CML blast crisis (n = 2), AML (n = 2), ALL (n = 1), CLL (n = 1) and multiple myeloma (n = 1). In five patients with acute leukemia or CML blast crisis D-PBSC/LI followed intensive chemotherapy (group A), in seven patients D-PBSC/LI were given without any prior chemotherapy (group B). In group A two patients were evaluable for hematologic toxicity. Leukopenia <1000/microl lasted for 10 and 19 days, and thrombocytopenia <20,000/microl for 11 and 13 days, respectively. In group B leukopenia <1000/microl and thrombocytopenia <20,000/microl was observed in only one patient. Moderate cytopenia developed in four of five evaluable patients. A complete remission could be achieved in all seven patients with CML who all developed acute and/or chronic GVHD. None of the remaining five patients achieved a complete remission despite acute and/or chronic GVHD in two of them. Four patients died from disease progression, one patient from a secondary lymphoma, and one patient as a result of uncontrolled GVHD. In conclusion, D-PBSC/LI is effective in inducing GVL reaction but it does not prevent pancytopenia in each case. It remains unclear if it mitigates the incidence and severity of pancytopenia.","['Siegert, W', 'Beyer, J', 'Kingreen, D', 'Blasczyk, R', 'Baurmann, H', 'Schwella, N', 'Schleicher, J', 'Kirsch, A', 'Huhn, D']","['Siegert W', 'Beyer J', 'Kingreen D', 'Blasczyk R', 'Baurmann H', 'Schwella N', 'Schleicher J', 'Kirsch A', 'Huhn D']","['Abteilung fur Innere Medizin und Poliklinik mS Hamatologie und Onkologie, Virchow Klinikum, Humboldt Universitat, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/prevention & control', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701387 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Sep;22(6):579-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701387.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For GVHD suppression, one of the most frequently used regimens has been the combination of cyclosporin (CsA) and a short course of methotrexate (MTX) although the optimal usage of these agents remains unclear. Here, we report the results of 55 patients with standard risk leukaemia who have undergone allogeneic transplantation using either bone marrow (n = 48) or G-CSF mobilised peripheral blood stem cells (n = 7) using CsA and MTX for GVHD prophylaxis where the dosage of CsA was regularly adjusted to maintain a trough whole blood level of 95-205 ng/ml for the first 50 days post-transplant. To achieve this level of CsA in the immediate post-transplant period, over 40% of patients required dose adjustments of CsA as a result of sub-therapeutic levels on day +1 post-transplant. The achievement of CsA levels within the therapeutic range was expedited following the introduction of a sliding scale for dose adjustment. With this regimen we have observed a low incidence of acute GVHD with only 11% of patients developing > or =grade II disease. With a median follow-up of 66 months (range 8-132) the probability of relapse is only 6.6%. The disease-free survival probability for all patients was 72% at 5 years. These results demonstrate that effective GVHD prevention with CsA and MTX can be achieved without a high risk of recurrent leukaemia provided that rapid attainment of therapeutic CsA levels is achieved and maintenance within a low therapeutic range may help to maximise this effect.","['Byrne, J L', 'Stainer, C', 'Hyde, H', 'Miflin, G', 'Haynes, A P', 'Bessell, E M', 'Russell, N H']","['Byrne JL', 'Stainer C', 'Hyde H', 'Miflin G', 'Haynes AP', 'Bessell EM', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital and University of Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701396 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Sep;22(6):541-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701396.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Type-I AL were not seen in herpes zoster (n = 15) aseptic meningeal reactions (n = 15), or in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (n = 14). Type-II AL were often present in meningitis of various aetiologies and in aseptic meningeal reactions, but not in leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The presence of type-I AL in the CSF was found to be indicative of enteroviral meningitis with the highest predictive value (69%), while type-II AL had a lower diagnostic positive predictive value in meningitis of the five aetiologies above. Type-I AL immunostained for CD4, while type-II AL were stained for CD8. The presence of type-I AL in CSF strongly suggests enteroviral meningitis, which warrants careful follow-up without antifungal, antituberculous or antibacterial agents.

To identify trophic factors that promote survival of these neurons, an in vitro model system was established in which organotypic cultures of the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were maintained in chemically-defined medium. We observe that the majority of magnocellular vasopressinergic neurons die in these cultures, while other cell populations such as corticotrophin-releasing factor producing parvicellular and oxytocin producing magnocellular cells retain a well preserved cytoarchitectonic organization. Degenerating vasopressinergic cells exhibit morphological signs of apoptosis and stained positively when analysed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotinylated dUTP nick end-labelling assay. Partial survival of vasopressinergic neurons occurred after co-culturing the paraventricular nucleus with neurohypophyseal explants, indicating that target-derived factors may be required for the survival of these neurons. Cell survival is dramatically increased by the administration of ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibiting factor, but not by interleukin 6 or the members of the neurotrophin family. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern analysis shows the presence of ciliary neurotrophic factor messenger RNA in the neurohypophysis. Thus, endogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibiting factor, produced by neurohypophyseal cells may function as a physiological survival factor for neurosecretory vasopressinergic neurons.","['Vutskits, L', 'Bartanusz, V', 'Schulz, M F', 'Kiss, J Z']","['Vutskits L', 'Bartanusz V', 'Schulz MF', 'Kiss JZ']","['Department of Morphology, University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11000-17-2 (Vasopressins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Brain Chemistry/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Ventricles/cytology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*genetics', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nerve Degeneration/physiopathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Neurons/chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Neurosecretory Systems/chemistry/physiology', 'Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus/cytology', 'Pituitary Gland, Posterior/chemistry/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vasopressins/analysis/*genetics']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(98)00177-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00177-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1998 Dec;87(3):571-82. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00177-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addressed the question: Could differences in the incidence of childhood leukaemia (age <15) be demonstrated between urban and rural communities in Taiwan between 1981 and 1990? METHODS: The log-linear regression model was used to assess the effects of age, level of urbanization, and calendar year on the variation of childhood leukaemia incidence rates between 1981 and 1990. RESULTS: Between 1981 and 1990, the overall incidence rate of childhood leukaemia increased by 20% (rate ratio (RR) = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.5). As compared to rural areas, metropolitan regions showed a significantly higher incidence rate during the study period (RR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6). This urban-rural difference was particularly notable among children <5 years old (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9). Dose-response analysis further indicated that risk of childhood leukaemia was monotonically associated with levels of urbanization. The significant gradient in the risk of childhood leukaemia with urbanization was contributed solely by children in the 0-4 years age group. CONCLUSIONS: We noticed a relationship between urbanization and risk of leukaemia in children. Because of a dramatic influx of people into metropolitan areas during the 1980s, our findings may have provided support for the putative association between 'population mixing' or 'population density' and risk of childhood leukaemia. Whether such association can be attributable to virus infection or other aetiologically related leukemogens warrants further investigations.","['Li, C Y', 'Lin, R S', 'Lin, C H']","['Li CY', 'Lin RS', 'Lin CH']","['Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Hsinchuang, Taipei Hsien, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ije/27.4.587 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1998 Aug;27(4):587-91. doi: 10.1093/ije/27.4.587.,,,,,,"['PIP: 138013', 'POP: 00281409']","['A log-linear regression model was applied to national cancer registry data on all', 'childhood leukemia cases diagnosed and reported in Taiwan during 1979-90 in a', 'study to measure the effects of age, level of urbanization, and calendar year', 'upon the variation of childhood leukemia incidence rates between 1981 and 1990.', 'Urban Taiwan underwent a period of rapid socioeconomic development during the', '1980s. 1498 cases of leukemia among people under age 15 years were diagnosed', 'during 1981-90 and reported to the Cancer Registry Center of Taiwan. 57.6% of', 'these cases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 25.6% were nonlymphoblastic', 'leukemia, and 16.8% were chronic leukemia and those unclassified.

However, transcript and enzyme activity levels of core 2 GlcNAc-transferase (C2GnT) were significantly down-regulated during TPA treatment. Following transfection and constitutive expression of full-length exogenous C2GnT transcript, C2GnT enzyme activities were maintained at high levels even after TPA treatment and down-regulation of cell surface sLex antigen expression by TPA was completely abolished. Furthermore, in the transfected cells, the KM93 reactivity of gp150 was not reduced by TPA treatment, and the inhibition of cell adhesion by TPA was also blocked. These results suggest that sLex expression is critically regulated by a single glycosyltransferase, C2GnT, during differentiation of KM3 cells.","['Nakamura, M', 'Kudo, T', 'Narimatsu, H', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Kikuchi, J', 'Asakura, S', 'Yang, W', 'Iwase, S', 'Hatake, K', 'Miura, Y']","['Nakamura M', 'Kudo T', 'Narimatsu H', 'Furukawa Y', 'Kikuchi J', 'Asakura S', 'Yang W', 'Iwase S', 'Hatake K', 'Miura Y']","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Minamikawachi, Tochigi 329-04, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.102 (beta-1,3-galactosyl-O-glycosyl-glycoprotein', 'beta-1,6-acetylglucosaminyl transferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'DNA Primers', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/10/03 00:00,1998/10/03 00:01,['1998/10/03 00:00'],"['1998/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.41.26779 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59812-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 9;273(41):26779-89. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.41.26779.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that wild type PML, but not PML-RARalpha, is covalently modified by the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Kamitani, T., Nguyen, H. P., Kito, K., Fukuda-Kamitani, T., and Yeh, E. T. H. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 3117-3120). To understand the mechanisms underlying the differential sentrinization of PML versus PML-RARalpha, extensive mutational analysis was carried out to determine which Lys residues are sentrinized. We show that Lys65 in the RING finger domain, Lys160 in the B1 Box, and Lys490 in the nuclear localization signal contributes three major sentrinization sites. The PML mutant with Lys to Arg substitutions in all three sites is expressed normally, but cannot be sentrinized. Furthermore, the triple substitution mutant is localized predominantly to the nucleoplasm, in contrast to wild type PML, which is localized to the nuclear bodies. Thus, sentrinization of PML, in the context of the RING finger and the B1 box, regulates nuclear body formation. Furthermore, we showed that sentrinization of PML-RARalpha could be restored by overexpression of sentrin, but not by retinoic acid treatment. These studies provide novel insight into the pathobiochemistry of acute promyelocytic leukemia and the sentrinization pathway.","['Kamitani, T', 'Kito, K', 'Nguyen, H P', 'Wada, H', 'Fukuda-Kamitani, T', 'Yeh, E T']","['Kamitani T', 'Kito K', 'Nguyen HP', 'Wada H', 'Fukuda-Kamitani T', 'Yeh ET']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",1998/10/03 02:14,2000/05/20 09:00,['1998/10/03 02:14'],"['1998/10/03 02:14 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/03 02:14 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.41.26675 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59799-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 9;273(41):26675-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.41.26675.,,['HL-45851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were randomized to receive oral dexamethasone of 2 or 4 mg/m2 during radiotherapy. The diagnosis of SS was made clinically based on symptoms of somnolence. All patients were followed for a minimum of 8 months. The overall incidence of SS was 40%. The development of SS was steroid dose dependent. In low dose steroid arm the incidence of SS was 64.3% (9/14), compared to 17.6% (3/17) in high dose arm with statistically significant difference (P = 0.008). The median time to development of SS was 4 weeks. The most common symptom of SS was drowsiness followed by anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased activity, irritability, fever and ataxia, respectively. The duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 14 days. The development of SS was not related to the presence of acute reactions, age at the time of CRT and sex. In all cases the symptoms subsided completely and spontaneously. Our results suggest that steroid coverage at a dose of 4 mg/m2 during CRT reduces the incidence of SS.

Thus, TUNEL application has been restrained to a narrow spectrum of sample conditions which has limited, in particular, retrospective surveys and apoptotic nuclei-protein double labelings. In the apoptotic nucleus two main obstacles intervene between TUNEL reagents and their targets: DNA hypercondensation and proteins around DNA. The former increases in the course of apoptosis and both are worsened by crosslinking and precipitating fixatives. This point out that TUNEL is an ambitious approach whose target, apoptotic DNA breaks, is less accessible than breaks occurring in non-apoptotic less compacted DNA. However, TUNEL has an advantage: the far greater degree of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. How to obtain a frank differential staining between apoptotic and non-apoptotic DNA? It appears that the answer relies on the pretreatment step and not in modifying the TUNEL staining protocol, which is optimal.

This influx is not linked with the amine-carboxyborane activating the calcitonin receptor in the tumor cells. Neither the agents nor TNF alpha directly inhibits DNA topoisomerase II activity but both did cause decreased phosphorylation of the enzyme by protein kinase C (PKC). The two agents caused synergistic inhibition. This event correlated with increased DNA protein linked breaks, DNA fragmentation and cell death. These protein linked breaks are additive with etoposide's effects but the latter agent's mechanism is different than phosphorylation of topoisomerase II. There was no evidence that the DNA fragmentation was caused by a calcium induced endonuclease enzyme in these cancer cells.

Studies of MMTVs allowed considerable insights into the mechanisms at work in breast tumorigenesis. MMTVs are essentially insertional mutagenes. Numerous oncogenes have been found altered by MMTVs, either specific for MMTVs or not. However, despite considerable attempts, the involvement of MMTVs in human breast cancer remains questionable. Yet a retroviral etiology of human breast cancer cannot be discarded since retroviruses are good candidates to play a role in diseases which, like human breast cancer, appear either as sporadic or inherited. Due to their replication cycle, retroviruses can be propagated not only as infectious agents able to freely infect host cells, but also as cellular genes which can be passed on to progeny. It is suggested here to search for a new human retrovirus in sporadic breast cancer, using the techniques which led to the isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1st January 1983 to 31st December 1993, 117 patients were treated at Centre Alexis Vautrin in Nancy for epithelial ovarian cancer by abdominal and/or pelvic irradiation after surgery. They were aged from 24 to 85 with a median of 56 years. There were ten patients with stage I (9%), 28 patients with stage II (24%), 60 patients with stage III (61%) and 19 patients with stage IV (16%) disease. Results of surgery were determined as follows: satisfactory with absence of tumoral residuum in 26% cases (30 patients) and with residuum inferior to 20 mm in 46% cases (52 patients; incomplete in 26% cases (31 patients) either because of residuum superior in 20 mm and/or incomplete surgery; and not evaluable in 3% cases (four patients). Seventy-seven patients were sent to the Centre for postoperative treatment (66% patients of the series), 48 of them (62.4%) after non-satisfactory surgery, 29 after satisfactory surgery (37.6%). Chemotherapy was administered to only 104 patients (89% cases), and contained platinum salts and cyclophosphamid for 87% of these patients. Fourteen patients (12%) received a single irradiation dose after surgery: three in stage I, three with poor evaluation of the disease in the initial stage, three with medical contraindications to chemotherapy treatment, six with contraindications due to advanced age (?? Makes 15 ). Histologically, 46% of patients had a serous adenocarcinoma, 9% a mucinous adenocarcinoma, 11% an endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 2% a clear cell adenocarcinoma, 1% an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, and 31% an epithelial carcinoma without any other indication. The histological grade which was recently introduced was rarely indicated. Complementary radiotherapeutic treatment consisted of pelvic irradiation for 14 patients (12%), abdomino-pelvic irradiation for 63 patients (54%), and total abdominal irradiation with a pelvic boost for 40 patients (34%). RESULTS: The immediate tolerance to irradiation can be considered as globally satisfactory since 9% of the patients (ten cases) had no problems and 64% of the patients developed a minor intolerance easily controlled by symptomatic treatments. There were also digestive complications: nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for 66% of the patients (50 cases); to a lesser extent, 20% of the cases experienced associated digestive and hematological complications (15 patients); 9% isolated hematological troubles such as anemia (seven patients); 4% digestive complications (three patients) and 1% hematological and urinary digestive troubles (one patients). Late irradiation sequelae were evaluated for 89 patients with a follow-up lasting from 4 months to 11 years. Sixty-six patients had no sequelae, eleven patients had minor tolerability problems--mainly digestive for more than half of them. Five patients presented severe complications, including hematological problems such as chronic thrombopenia in two cases, urinary-problems in two other cases, and one patient presented with a case of histologically proven malabsorption. Two patients presented major problems; one case of radic cystitis and one of radic bowel. Two patients died of iatrogenic causes: one of induced leukemia, the other of treatment-induced digestive and renal complications. The overall survival rate was 30% at 5 years and 22% at 10 years. It was 90% at 5 and 10 years for stage I patients, 60% at 5 years and 30% at 10 years for stage II patients, 22% at 5 years and 8% at 10 years for stage III patients, and finally 10% at 5 years for stage IV patients. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis of 117 epithelial ovarian cancers, treated over 10 years and which all received pelvic and/or abdominal irradiation, we can conclude that this treatment is globally well tolerated and that it yields a","['Quetin, P', 'Marchal, C', 'Hoffstetter, S', 'Cutuli, B', 'Beckendorf, V', 'Lapeyre, M', 'Peiffert, D', 'Bey, P']","['Quetin P', 'Marchal C', 'Hoffstetter S', 'Cutuli B', 'Beckendorf V', 'Lapeyre M', 'Peiffert D', 'Bey P']","['Departement de radiotherapie, centre Paul-Strauss, Strasbourg, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Cancer Radiother,Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique,9711272,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/10/02 00:00,1998/10/02 00:01,['1998/10/02 00:00'],"['1998/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S127832189880348X [pii]', '10.1016/s1278-3218(98)80348-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Radiother. 1998 Jul-Aug;2(4):366-74. doi: 10.1016/s1278-3218(98)80348-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,Tolerance et place de l'irradiation dans le traitement des cancers epitheliaux de l'ovaire.,,,,,,,

The structure of [Pt(cis-1,4-DACH)trans-(acetate)2Cl2] (1) was determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystals were monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n (no. 14) with a = 10.193(2), b = 10.687(2), c = 14.265(3) A, beta = 99.67(3) degrees, Z = 4. The total reflections collected were 2556. The structure refinement converged to R1 = 0.0539 and wR2 = 0.1531. In this complex, platinum has distorted octahedral geometry, and cis-1,4-DACH is in a unique twist-boat configuration. cis-1,4-DACH forms a seven-member chelating ring with platinum, leading to considerable strain in bidentate DACH binding. The strain is evidenced by a large 126.5(9) degrees C-N-Pt angle. The N-Pt-N angle is expanded to 97.4(5) degrees owing to geometric constraints of the cis-1,4-DACH geometry. Three lower homologs of the cis-1,4-DACH-Pt(IV) series were tested in the murine L1210/0 leukemia model for antitumor activity. The results indicate that activity decreases in ascending the homologous series, and that the activity of two of the complexes is substantially better than that of cisplatin with respect to increase in life span and cures.","['Shamsuddin, S', 'Santillan, C C', 'Stark, J L', 'Whitmire, K H', 'Siddik, Z H', 'Khokhar, A R']","['Shamsuddin S', 'Santillan CC', 'Stark JL', 'Whitmire KH', 'Siddik ZH', 'Khokhar AR']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (bis(acetato)(1,4-diaminocyclohexane)dichloroplatinum(IV))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",1998/10/02 00:00,1998/10/02 00:01,['1998/10/02 00:00'],"['1998/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0162-0134(98)10029-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0162-0134(98)10029-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 1998 Aug;71(1-2):29-35. doi: 10.1016/s0162-0134(98)10029-6.,,['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These have been shown to act both in an autocrine and paracrine manner to regulate preimplantation embryo development and migration which is necessary for placental development. The creation of mouse strains lacking genes for receptors or growth factors has proved important in defining which of these are essential in reproduction in this species and those that play a lesser role. Using this approach, a lack of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the murine endometrium has been shown to result in failed implantation. Evidence from infertile women supports the notion that abnormal expression of LIF, or the related cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the endometrium may underlie some forms of human infertility. This offers the opportunity for therapeutic intervention, if levels of these cytokines can be altered in a specific and controlled way. The recently described method of delivery of genes to the uterine epithelium provides a powerful new approach by which this could be achieved. The ability to regulate the function of specific genes in the endometrium by direct gene transfer raises the prospect of novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","['Smith, S K', 'Charnock-Jones, D S', 'Sharkey, A M']","['Smith SK', 'Charnock-Jones DS', 'Sharkey AM']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Maternity Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Infertility, Female', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy']",1998/10/02 00:00,1998/10/02 00:01,['1998/10/02 00:00'],"['1998/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_3.237 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1998 Jun;13 Suppl 3:237-43; discussion 244-6. doi: 10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_3.237.,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include Npt1 (type I), Npt2 (type II), and the cellular receptors for gibbon ape leukemia virus (Glvr-1) and amphotropic murine retrovirus (Ram-1) (type III). We defined the tissue distribution as well as the relative renal abundance of Npt1, Npt2, Glvr-1, and Ram-1 mRNAs and examined the effects of low-Pi diet, the Hyp mutation, and growth hormone (GH) on their renal expression by ribonuclease protection assay. In normal mouse kidney, Npt1, Npt2, Glvr-1, and Ram-1 accounted for 15 +/- 1.0, 84 +/- 1.0, 0.5 +/- 0.2, and 0.5 +/- 0.3% of total Na+-Pi cotransporter mRNAs, respectively. Evidence was obtained for low-abundance Npt1 mRNA expression in liver and Npt2 mRNA expression in intestine, whereas Glvr-1 and Ram-1 mRNAs were also detected in bone, intestine, heart, and liver. Npt2 mRNA was localized to proximal tubules in the renal outer cortex, whereas Glvr-1 transcripts were detected throughout the kidney by in situ hybridization. The Hyp mutation elicited a significant reduction in renal Npt1 and Npt2 mRNAs (78 +/- 8 and 57 +/- 3% of normal, respectively), whereas neither low-Pi diet nor GH influenced the renal abundance of Npt1 and Npt2 transcripts. Renal Glvr-1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in Hyp mice and GH-treated mice (145 +/- 6 and 165 +/- 5% of control, respectively), whereas the renal abundance of Ram-1 transcript was unaffected by either the Hyp mutation, low-Pi diet, or GH treatment. In summary, we demonstrate that Npt2 is the predominant Na+-Pi cotransporter in mouse kidney, that Npt2 and Glvr-1 have distinct patterns of renal expression, and that the Hyp mutation modulates the renal expression of Npt1, Npt2, and Glvr-1 mRNAs. Our results suggest that increased renal Glvr-1 mRNA may contribute to GH stimulation of renal Na+-Pi cotransport.","['Tenenhouse, H S', 'Roy, S', 'Martel, J', 'Gauthier, C']","['Tenenhouse HS', 'Roy S', 'Martel J', 'Gauthier C']","[""Medical Research Council Genetics Group, McGill University-Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute, Departments of Pediatrics and Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3H 1P3.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc17a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc17a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Organ Specificity', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1998/10/01 00:00,1998/10/01 00:01,['1998/10/01 00:00'],"['1998/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajprenal.1998.275.4.F527 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1998 Oct;275(4):F527-34. doi: 10.1152/ajprenal.1998.275.4.F527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1152/ajprenal.1998.275.4.F527 [doi]

Tzeng, Y.-M. Kim, B. R. Pitt, A. Lizonova, I. Kovesdi, and T. R. Billiar. Surgery 122: 255-263, 1997). In the present study, we confirmed this observation by establishing stable transfectants after retroviral gene transfer [replication-deficient retrovirus (DFG)] of human iNOS (DFG-iNOS) SPAECs and then used all three approaches (Ad, DFG, and SNAP) to determine underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. Continuous endogenous production of NO in itself did not cause apoptosis as assessed by phase-contrast microscopy, nuclear morphology, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Prolonged (72-96 h) synthesis of NO, however, after DFG- or replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad. CMV)-iNOS or SNAP (100 microM, 96 h) inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis. The kinetics of such protection suggested that NO may be inducing other gene products. Ad-mediated transfer of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) decreased the sensitivity of wild-type SPAECs to LPS-induced apoptosis. MnSOD, however, was not induced in an NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)-sensitive time-dependent fashion after Ad.CMV-iNOS. Other inducible genes that may be affected by NO and that may protect against potential oxidant-mediated LPS-induced apoptosis including 70-kDa heat shock protein, heme oxygenase-1, metallothionein, and Bcl-2 also were not elevated in an L-NMMA-sensitive, time-dependent fashion. Although the candidate gene product underlying NO-induced protection remains unclear, we did note that prolonged synthesis of NO inhibited LPS-induced activation of an interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-like cysteine protease (cysteine protease protein-32-like) in a dithiothreitol-sensitive fashion, suggesting that S-nitrosylation of an important downstream target of convergence of apoptotic signals may contribute to the sensitivity of SPAECs to LPS.","['Ceneviva, G D', 'Tzeng, E', 'Hoyt, D G', 'Yee, E', 'Gallagher, A', 'Engelhardt, J F', 'Kim, Y M', 'Billiar, T R', 'Watkins, S A', 'Pitt, B R']","['Ceneviva GD', 'Tzeng E', 'Hoyt DG', 'Yee E', 'Gallagher A', 'Engelhardt JF', 'Kim YM', 'Billiar TR', 'Watkins SA', 'Pitt BR']","['Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Pulmonary Artery', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Sheep', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vacuoles/ultrastructure', 'omega-N-Methylarginine/pharmacology']",1998/10/01 00:00,1998/10/01 00:01,['1998/10/01 00:00'],"['1998/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajplung.1998.275.4.L717 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1998 Oct;275(4):L717-28. doi: 10.1152/ajplung.1998.275.4.L717.,,"['R29 HL057854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-44100/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-09368/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32154/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1152/ajplung.1998.275.4.L717 [doi]

MATERIAL: Two Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors, thapsigargin (TG) and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), and three hydroquinone-antioxidants, 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (DTBHQ), 2,5-di-(tert/amyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (DTAHQ), 2-(tertbutyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (MTBHQ) were used. TREATMENT: Cells were treated with TG, CPA, DTBHQ, DTAHQ and MTBHQ for 3 h in the presence of 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and released TNF-alpha from the cells was measured (n > or = 4). RESULTS: All Ca2--ATPase inhibitors (TG, CPA, DTBHQ and DTAHQ) induced TNF-alpha release in a dose-dependent manner. TNF-alpha release was inhibited by treatment with protein kinase C inhibitors (staurosporine, Ro31-8220, calophostin C) (p < or = 0.05). In contrast, MTBHQ, which does not induce increases in [Ca2+]i, did not induce the release of TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha release induced by DTBHQ and CPA was inhibited by treatment with actinomycin-D, the immunosuppressant FK506 and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (p < or = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 1) that [Ca2+]i increase and subsequent activation of protein kinase C is necessary for the release of TNF-alpha, and they work synergistically, 2) that the TNF-alpha release induced by Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors can be regulated at the transcriptional level.","['Teshima, R', 'Onose, J', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Sawada, J']","['Teshima R', 'Onose J', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Sawada J']","['Division of Biochemistry and Immunochemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. rteshima@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Mutant TNF 471, from which 7 N-terminal amino acids of native TNF were deleted and Pro8, Ser9 and Asp10 were replaced by Arg, Lys and Arg, possessed the highest activity among the TNF mutants, and its activity was 120-fold that of native TNF. The various biological activities of TNF were signaled through 2 distinct receptors, p55 and p75. Although cytotoxicity was reported to involve mainly p55, this differentiation-inducing activity was not well understood. The fact that the affinity of TNF 471 was higher to p55 and lower to p75 than that of native TNF by a binding competition assay suggested that the differentiation-inducing activity was also signaled through p55. To verify this hypothesis, the human myelogenous leukemic cell line, KG-1, which scarcely expresses either receptor and does not differentiate with TNF, was transduced with the p55 or p75 gene. Subsequently p55 transfectants manifested a greater ability to differentiate; however, p75 transfectants did not differ from parental cells or from mock-transfectants. Further, the differentiation of p55 transfectants induced by TNF was reduced by the inhibitor of protein-kinase-C (PKC), staurosporine. These results indicate that the differentiation-inducing activity was signaled through the TNF receptor, p55, via PKC and that the excellent ability of TNF 471 to induce differentiation was related to its high affinity for p55.","['Sato, T', 'Watanabe, N', 'Yamauchi, N', 'Sasaki, H', 'Kobayashi, D', 'Tsuji, N', 'Okamoto, T', 'Hagino, T', 'Niitsu, Y']","['Sato T', 'Watanabe N', 'Yamauchi N', 'Sasaki H', 'Kobayashi D', 'Tsuji N', 'Okamoto T', 'Hagino T', 'Niitsu Y']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics/*pharmacology']",1998/10/01 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/01 02:02'],"['1998/10/01 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/01 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19981005)78:2<223::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19981005)78:2<223::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Oct 5;78(2):223-32. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19981005)78:2<223::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M-07e cells proliferated in response to IL-15, while UT-7 and TF-1 cells failed to respond. In addition, IL-15 supported long-term proliferation of M-07e cells, thus allowing selection of a subline (M-07SB), which displayed an enhanced sensitivity to IL-15. M-07e and M-07SB cells undergo apoptosis following 48-hr growth factor (GM-CSF or IL-15) starvation, as detected by cytofluorimetric analysis and DNA laddering. IL-15 (20 ng/ml) prevented apoptosis in both cell lines. M-07e and M-07SB expressed IL-2R beta, IL-2R gamma, Jak-1 and Jak-3 mRNA, while IL-15R alpha mRNA was undetectable. In contrast, IL-15R alpha was expressed in UT-7 and TF-1 cells, which lacked expression of IL-2R beta mRNA and, in the case of UT-7, also of Jak-3 mRNA. Accordingly, surface IL-2R beta protein was identified only in M-07e and M-07SB cells, by indirect immunofluorescence, while no expression of IL-2R alpha and IL-15R alpha was detected. Anti-IL-2R beta antibodies (10 microg/ml) efficiently blocked (90% inhibition) the proliferation and the anti-apoptotic effect induced by IL-15, while anti-GM-CSFR alpha antibodies had no effect. Anti-IL-2R gamma antibodies were less efficient at proliferation inhibition but synergized with suboptimal concentrations of anti-IL-2R beta antibodies.

We have also suggested that P-glycoprotein-mediated MTX transport arises in these cells due to a deficiency in the normal MTX transport route, the reduced folate carrier (RFC). We have now determined the nucleotide sequence of the RFC gene in CEM/MTX R1-3 cells and confirm that the carrier is defective in these cells as a result of a premature stop mutation at codon 99, which severely truncates the encoded protein. CEM/MTX R3 cells were removed from MTX, and a series of sublines with increasing MDR1 expression were derived, following selection with vincristine. These cells show increasing cross-resistance to vincristine as well as other drugs associated with the multidrug resistance phenotype. More importantly, the increased P-glycoprotein expression correlates with increased resistance to MTX, supporting the hypothesis that in cells with a defective carrier protein, MTX can become a substrate for P-glycoprotein.

The TNF/TNF receptor system also plays a significant role in AICD of mature T cells and in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. We previously demonstrated that in human Jurkat leukemia cells, AICD is triggered mainly by the rapid release of preformed FasL upon TCR stimulation. In the present work, we show that the cytotoxic cytokine APO2 ligand (APO2L; also known as TRAIL) is constitutively expressed as an intracytoplasmic protein in Jurkat T cells and derived sublines. APO2L is also detected in fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a significant number of donors, and the amount of both FasL and APO2L substantially increases upon blast generation. A neutralizing anti-APO2L monoclonal antibody (mAb) partially suppresses the cytotoxicity induced by supernatants of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-prestimulated Jurkat or human PBMC on non-activated Jurkat cells, indicating that APO2L is released by these cells and contributes to AICD. A combination of neutralizing anti-APO2L and anti-Fas mAb blocks around 60 % of the toxicity associated with supernatants from PHA-activated human PBMC. These results show that FasL and APO2L account for the majority of cytotoxic activity released during AICD, and suggest that additional uncharacterized factors may also contribute to this process.","['Martinez-Lorenzo, M J', 'Alava, M A', 'Gamen, S', 'Kim, K J', 'Chuntharapai, A', 'Pineiro, A', 'Naval, J', 'Anel, A']","['Martinez-Lorenzo MJ', 'Alava MA', 'Gamen S', 'Kim KJ', 'Chuntharapai A', 'Pineiro A', 'Naval J', 'Anel A']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1998/10/01 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/01 02:02'],"['1998/10/01 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/01 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199809)28:09<2714::AID-IMMU2714>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199809)28:09<2714::AID-IMMU2714>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Sep;28(9):2714-25. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199809)28:09<2714::AID-IMMU2714>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunol. 1993. 23: 1417-1421). The role of TCR complementarity-determining region (CDR)3alpha residues 93 and 100-102 was examined by site-directed mutagenesis, following expression of the TCR alpha and beta extracellular domains from one clone as a TCR zeta fusion heterodimer in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells. For the first time we have measured direct binding of tetrameric HLA B*2705/NP383-391 complexes to transfected TCR. Independently peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APC) were used to induce TCR-mediated degranulation of RBL transfectants. Our results show a key role for the conserved TCRalpha CDR3 J alpha-encoded residue Y102 in recognition of HLA B27/NP383-391. Thus the Y102D mutation abolished both tetramer binding and degranulation in the presence of peptide-pulsed APC. Even the Y102F mutation, differing only by a single hydroxyl group from the native TCR, abolished detectable degranulation. Further mutations F93A and S100R also abolished recognition. Interestingly, the N101A mutation recognized HLA B27/NP in functional assays despite having significantly reduced tetramer binding, a finding consistent with ""kinetic editing"" models of T cell activation. Modeling of the GRb TCR CDR3alpha loop suggests that residue Y102 contacts the HLA B*2705 alpha1 helix. It is thus possible that selection of germ-line TCRAJ-encoded residues at position 102 may be MHC driven.","['Bowness, P', 'Allen, R L', 'Barclay, D N', 'Jones, E Y', 'McMichael, A J']","['Bowness P', 'Allen RL', 'Barclay DN', 'Jones EY', 'McMichael AJ']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, GB. pbowness@worf.molbiol.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (HLA-B27 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', '*Complementarity Determining Regions', 'HLA-B27 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/*immunology', 'Influenza A virus/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology']",1998/10/01 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/10/01 02:02'],"['1998/10/01 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/10/01 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199809)28:09<2704::AID-IMMU2704>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199809)28:09<2704::AID-IMMU2704>3.0.CO;2-B [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Sep;28(9):2704-13. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199809)28:09<2704::AID-IMMU2704>3.0.CO;2-B.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the granules of all the tumor cells were negative for peroxidase activity, they all demonstrated chloroacetate-esterase and acid phosphatase activity. All the tumors reacted with cross-reacting antibodies against the CD3 antigen (epsilon chain) and did not react with a cross-reacting monoclonal antibody directed against epitopes on cytoplasmic domains of the CD20 antigen. Three tumors had a positive reaction with a monoclonal human CD57-like antibody. This is highly suggestive of either a cytotoxic T cell or a natural killer cell origin of the neoplasias. In three cats, although other abdominal organs were affected to a variable extent, the main neoplastic lesions were localized in the gastrointestinal tract and the jejunal lymph nodes. In contrast, in the other three cats, organ involvement was more widespread, affecting the lung (two), myocardium (two), precardiac mediastinum (one), salivary gland (one), and spinal cord (one); in addition, leukemia was present in two of these cats.

This agenda will need to be multidisciplinary. It should include epidemiology, pediatrics, exposure assessment, toxicology, and health economics. The ultimate goals of this agenda need to be (1) the identification of etiologic associations between environmental exposures and pediatric disease; (2) the elucidation of disease mechanisms; (3) improved treatment; and (4) prevention.","['Landrigan, P J']",['Landrigan PJ'],"['Department of Community Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Hazardous Substances)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Asthma/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/prevention & control', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hazardous Substances/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/10/01 00:00,1998/10/01 00:01,['1998/10/01 00:00'],"['1998/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 1998;11(2):189-94.,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study is to determine possible differences in the status of oral health between the hospitalized cancer-ward children and children hospitalized, but with good general health, in order to develop special prophylactic measures as required. The visual oral findings included the prevalence of caries (DMF/T, Decayed, Missed, Filled/Tooth), oral hygiene, severe periodontal diseases, records of defects of the oral mucosa, and information was collected on fluoridation. For both groups of children, the degree of treatment-need of the remaining dentition was 63%. Caries-free dentition was found in 53.7% of the surgery patients and 40.7% of the cancer-ward children. Good oral hygiene was found in only 49% of the cases among the cancer-ward children, while among the children without systemic illness the figure climbed to 87% of the cases. Gingivitis among the children without general illness was only diagnosed in 7.4% of the cases, but in contrast, among the cancer-ward children the percentage of gingivitis (62.8% ) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001). The present study strongly suggests that for children with cancer and subject to aggressive therapy and/or long hospitalizations, beyond the general medical examination on hospital admission, a dental examination should also be instituted.","['Willershausen, B', 'Lenzner, K', 'Hagedorn, B', 'Ernst, C']","['Willershausen B', 'Lenzner K', 'Hagedorn B', 'Ernst C']","['Department of Restorative Dentistry and Periodontology, Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Augustusplatz 2, D-55131 Mainz, Germany. willersh@goofy.zdv.Uni-Mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dental Caries/complications/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Gingivitis/complications/prevention & control', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/*pathology/therapy', '*Oral Health']",1998/10/01 00:00,1998/10/01 00:01,['1998/10/01 00:00'],"['1998/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med Res. 1998 Oct 14;3(10):480-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IF-5A contains an unusual amino acid, hypusine (N-epsilon-(4-aminobutyl-2-hydroxy)lysine), that is required for its function. The first step in the post-translational modification of lysine to hypusine is catalyzed by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase, the structure of which has been published recently. RESULTS: IF-5A from the archebacterium Pyrobaculum aerophilum has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli with selenomethionine substitution. The crystal structure of IF-5A has been determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and refined to 1.75 A. Unmodified P. aerophilum IF-5A is found to be a beta structure with two domains and three separate hydrophobic cores. CONCLUSIONS: The lysine (Lys42) that is post-translationally modified by deoxyhypusine synthase is found at one end of the IF-5A molecule in an turn between beta strands beta4 and beta5; this lysine residue is freely solvent accessible. The C-terminal domain is found to be homologous to the cold-shock protein CspA of E. coli, which has a well characterized RNA-binding fold, suggesting that IF-5A is involved in RNA binding.","['Peat, T S', 'Newman, J', 'Waldo, G S', 'Berendzen, J', 'Terwilliger, T C']","['Peat TS', 'Newman J', 'Waldo GS', 'Berendzen J', 'Terwilliger TC']","['Life Sciences Division Los Alamos National Laboratory Mail Stop M888, Los Alamos, New Mexico, 87545, USA peat@proi1.lanl.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Structure,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",101087697,"['0 (DNA, Archaeal)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (aIF-5A)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA, Archaeal/chemistry', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Static Electricity', 'Thermoproteaceae/*chemistry/genetics']",1998/10/01 00:00,1998/10/01 00:01,['1998/10/01 00:00'],"['1998/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-2126(98)00120-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-2126(98)00120-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Structure. 1998 Sep 15;6(9):1207-14. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(98)00120-8.,"['PDB/1BKB', 'PDB/1VIE', 'PDB/R1BKBSF']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects in this cascade are correlated with an impaired cytokine-inducible differentiation of various other myeloid cell lines. Although treatment with IL-6 increased the amount of activated transcription factor Stat3 in the myeloid leukemia line C, differentiation was not induced. However, after cotransfection with expression constructs for the tyrosine kinase Jak2 and Stat factors 3 or 5a, treatment of the cells with IL-6 caused a decrease in the number of viable cells. In parallel, an increase in the percentage of differentiated cells occurred.

As they all expressed IL-6R and as none of them responded to exogenous IL-6 under conventional serum-supplemented culture conditions, we investigated whether signaling through IL-6R plays any role in maintaining their spontaneous colony growth. This was done by treating the cells with monoclonal antibodies made against the ligand-specific IL-6R alpha-chain or the signal transducer gp130. In serum-supplemented cultures inhibition of gp130 function did not affect the cell line growth, whereas anti-IL-6R alpha-chain antibody reduced colony growth. While some of the cell lines also showed similar growth characteristics in a serum-free environment, some others changed their growth pattern and stopped responding to anti-IL-6R alpha-chain treatment. At the same time, these cell lines also began to respond to exogenously added IL-6 and, interestingly, were stimulated by anti-gp130 antibody. Hence, in some of the blast cells, clonogenic cell growth seemed to be also negatively controlled by an endogenously produced growth-depressing cytokine or cytokines that utilize gp130. All the cell lines, whether cultured in the presence or absence of serum expressed IL-6 both at mRNA and protein level. The current results indicate that AML cells can use IL-6 as a growth stimulating factor, supplied either paracrinely or autocrinely. This could implicate the use of anti-IL-6R alpha-chain antagonists in AML treatment, not IL-6.","['Saily, M', 'Koistinen, P', 'Zheng, A', 'Savolainen, E R']","['Saily M', 'Koistinen P', 'Zheng A', 'Savolainen ER']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/agonists/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01083.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Sep;61(3):190-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01083.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HLA-A-, HLA-B-, and HLA-DR-compatible unrelated bone marrow was given to 132 patients. The diagnoses included chronic myeloid leukemia (n=43), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=29), acute myeloid leukemia (n=27), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=4), lymphoma (n=3), myeloma (n=1), myelofibrosis (n=1), severe aplastic anemia (n=12), and metabolic disorders (n=12). The median age was 25 years (range 1-55 years). HLA class I was typed serologically, and class II was typed by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primer pairs. Immunosuppression consisted of antithymocyte globulin or OKT3 for 5 days before transplantation and methotrexate combined with cyclosporine. RESULTS: Engraftment was seen in 127 of 132 patients (96%). Bacteremia occurred in 47%, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in 49%, and CMV disease in 8%. The cumulative incidences of acute GVHD > or = grade II and of chronic GVHD were 23% and 50%, respectively. The 5-year transplant-related mortality rate was 39%.

Bone marrow from 14 donors and their HLA-identical recipients undergoing BMT for haematological malignancies were studied. Using non-radioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (cold SSCP) of complementary DNA encoding CD33 and CD34, three DNA polymorphisms, two in CD33 and one in CD34 were found and sequenced. Two were in non-coding regions, but in CD33, ATA or ATG at codon 183 resulted in an Ile or Met in the protein sequence. Nonapeptides derived from both alleles were predicted to bind to HLA A68.1. Thus two alleles of CD33 protein exist that could be mHA. With an alternate allele frequency of < 10%, allo-responses against CD33 would be uncommon after marrow transplantation. However, donors homozygous for this allele could be used to generate cytotoxic T cells against the frequent CD33 allele, for adoptive therapy of leukaemia.","['Raptis, A', 'Clave, E', 'Mavroudis, D', 'Molldrem, J', 'Van Rhee, F', 'Barrett, A J']","['Raptis A', 'Clave E', 'Mavroudis D', 'Molldrem J', 'Van Rhee F', 'Barrett AJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1652, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Hematologic Diseases/*immunology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00906.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Sep;102(5):1354-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00906.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of cases show uniform morphological and phenotypic features characterized by a monotonous proliferation of small-to-medium-sized irregular B cells that express CD5 and bright surface immunoglobulin IgM and IgD. By sequence analysis of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (VH), it has been shown that these lymphoma cells carry little if no somatic mutations, as described for the fetal CD5+ cells or B1 cells. Besides mantle cell lymphoma with classic histological features, a morphological variant of mantle cell lymphoma with blastic features and a more aggressive clinical course has been described. To investigate whether this variant is closely related, by the cell of origin, to typical cases, we analysed the presence and the pattern of somatic mutations of the VH genes in a series of nine cases diagnosed as such. Our cases of blastic mantle cell lymphomas rearrange most frequently VH4 and VH3 family genes. In three cases there was a complete homology to published germline genes, and a near complete homology was documented in another three. In contrast, the remaining three cases showed somatic mutations in their rearranged VH genes. Mutation analysis revealed evidence for antigen selection in one of these three cases. Taken together, these data are similar to those of normal adult-type B1 cells and those described for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) but slightly different to those reported for classic mantle cell lymphoma. It is likely that blastic mantle cell lymphoma as well as CLL originates from adult-type B1 cells. More cases will need to be studied to determine whether classic mantle cell lymphoma is different from the blastic subtype and if it arises from fetal-type B1 cells.","['Pittaluga, S', 'Tierens, A', 'Pinyol, M', 'Campo, E', 'Delabie, J', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C']","['Pittaluga S', 'Tierens A', 'Pinyol M', 'Campo E', 'Delabie J', 'De Wolf-Peeters C']","['Department of Pathology II, University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sequence Analysis']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00907.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Sep;102(5):1301-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00907.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells subsequently migrate within the stroma, a process also involving VLA-4. A variant of the pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line NALM-6, designated 4A1, lacking expression of VLA-4, was generated by radiation-induced mutagenesis followed by several rounds of negative selection with immunomagnetic beads, fluorescence activated cell sorting and clonal expansion. In vitro assays using 4A1 cells showed reduced binding to, and migration under, the murine stromal line M2-10B4. Sublethally irradiated mice (n=19) with severe combined immunodeficiency were injected intravenously with NALM-6 cells. Animals developed signs of leukaemia with hind-limb paralysis at a median of 30 d (95% confidence interval 28-30). Although there were no gross abnormal findings at autopsy, histological analysis revealed extensive marrow replacement and focal liver infiltration with leukaemic blasts, which were confirmed to be of human origin by flow cytometry. 12 mice were injected with a similar number of cells from the VLA-4-negative variant cell line 4A1. Six mice developed signs of leukaemia after 43-74d, with the remaining six being free of signs of disease after > 100d (P<0.001). Mice in this group with leukaemia had a lower incidence of hind-limb paralysis and less leukaemic infiltration in the marrow, but in some cases had large tumour nodules elsewhere. After a single 500 microg intraperitoneal injection of anti-murine VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (MK2.7), five additional mice were injected with an identical number of wild-type (VLA-4+) NALM-6. All animals developed signs of leukaemia after a similar period to those injected with wild-type NALM-6 only.

Recent studies have shown that the HLA-C locus encodes two ligands (NK1 and NK2) recognized by receptors on natural killer (NK) cells. HLA-Cw alleles encoding these ligands are dimorphic, dependent on whether they encode one or other NK ligand. To determine whether susceptibility to the common (CD10+) form of childhood ALL (c-ALL) is associated with NK1 or NK2, we carried out a molecular analysis of 94 childhood c-ALL patients and 136 infant controls.

We compared our results with those obtained by analysis of colonies from newly diagnosed patients (n=4) and patients achieving no cytogenetic response (n=1) or incomplete cytogenetic response to treatment with IFN-alpha (n=5). A total of 1239 informative colonies were analysed. A small proportion of BCR-ABL-positive colonies was detected in all eight patients in complete cytogenetic remission, suggesting the persistence of leukaemia that could potentially lead to relapse. The overall proportion of BCR-ABL-positive colonies in patients achieving a cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha correlated with the levels of BCR-ABL transcripts detected in the peripheral blood by competitive RT-PCR (P=0.004). We conclude that residual disease detected in the peripheral blood of complete cytogenetic responders to IFN-alpha is at least partly derived from clonogenic myeloid cells.

She was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia in 1994, and has since then received chemotherapy.

Molecular analysis indicated that the patient was heterozygous at the RH locus, carrying one haplotype in which the RHD gene exhibited a single nucleotide deletion (G600) resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon, and a normal RHCE gene (allele Ce). The second haplotype contained only the RHCE gene (allele ce) and was normal. Further analysis carried out on total leucocytes, purified neutrophils, EBV-lymphoblastoid cell line and cultured erythroblasts indicated that the G600 deletion was restricted to the myeloid lineage.

We have utilized a recently developed method that enables the rapid and convenient detection of mutations at the cDNA level, namely, the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) to analyse Btk sequences from 27 patients with different types of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The only alteration that we observed was a polymorphism at position 2031. This polymorphism has already been seen in previous studies. Furthermore, using the same methodology, we identified the Btk mutations in six XLA (X-linked agammaglobulinaemia) patients.

Synergistic stimulatory effects of TPO with stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were observed in both TPO-responding cases (9/17) and TPO-non-responding cases (8/13). In a leukaemic blast colony assay. significant growth response to TPO was observed in 5/6 CD7+ and 4/17 CD7-AML cases examined. However, the effect of TPO on the growth of CD7+ leukaemic blasts was not so potent as that of IL-3 and SCF, both of which support the proliferation of primitive haemopoietic progenitors. Expression of c-mpl (TPO receptor) was significantly higher in CD7+ AML cases than in CD7- cases, suggesting a relationship between expression of c-mpl and proliferative response to TPO. These data indicate that CD7+ leukaemic blasts express functional TPO receptors and proliferate in response to TPO. These observations also imply that CD7 expression on AML blasts may indicate involvement of leukaemic progenitors at an early stage of multipotent haemopoietic stem cells.","['Tokunaga, Y', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Okamura, T', 'Eto, T', 'Gondo, H', 'Kamimura, T', 'Okamura, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Tokunaga Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Okamura T', 'Eto T', 'Gondo H', 'Kamimura T', 'Okamura S', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00915.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Sep;102(5):1232-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00915.x.,,,['Br J Haematol. 1999 Mar;104(3):642-3.

The incidence of secondary NHL is associated to individual parameters (age), first cancer (chronic lympho proliferative syndrome, Hodgkin's disease) and previous chemo- and/or radiotherapy.

We and others have recently demonstrated efficient transduction by using an HIV-1-based vector gene delivery system into various human cell types including human CD34(+) cells or terminally differentiated neurons. Here we compare the transduction efficiency of two vectors, HIV-based and murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-based vectors, on untreated and highly purified human HSC subsets that are virtually all in G0/G1. The HIV vector, but not MuLV vector supernatants, transduced freshly isolated G0/G1 HSC from mobilized peripheral blood. Single-step transduction using replication-defective HIV resulted in HSC that expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene while retaining their stem cell phenotype; clonal outgrowths of these GFP+ HSC on bone marrow stromal cells fully retained GFP expression for at least 5 weeks. MuLV-based vectors did not transduce resting HSC, as measured by transgene expression, but did so readily when the HSC were actively cycling after culture in vitro for 3 days in a cytokine cocktail. These results suggest that resting HSC may be transduced by lentiviral-based, but not MuLV, vectors and maintain their primitive phenotype, pluripotentiality, and at least in vitro, transgene expression.","['Uchida, N', 'Sutton, R E', 'Friera, A M', 'He, D', 'Reitsma, M J', 'Chang, W C', 'Veres, G', 'Scollay, R', 'Weissman, I L']","['Uchida N', 'Sutton RE', 'Friera AM', 'He D', 'Reitsma MJ', 'Chang WC', 'Veres G', 'Scollay R', 'Weissman IL']","['SyStemix, Inc., A Norvartis Company, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. nuchida@stemcell.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Thy-1 Antigens/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.20.11939 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Sep 29;95(20):11939-44. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.20.11939.,,['K08 CA71671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC21744,,,,

To study the functional properties of hematopoietic cells expressing SCL, we have generated mutant mice (SCLlacZ/w) in which the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene has been ""knocked in"" to the SCL locus, thereby linking beta-galactosidase expression to transcription from the SCL promoter. Bone marrow cells from heterozygous SCLlacZ/w mice were sorted into fractions expressing high, intermediate and low levels of beta-galactosidase (designated lacZhigh, lacZint, and lacZneg). Cells that were lacZhigh or lacZint were enriched for day 12 spleen colony-forming units and myeloid and erythroid colony-forming cells (CFCs). These fractions included >99% of the erythroid and >90% of the myeloid CFCs. Culture of sorted bone marrow populations on stromal cells secreting interleukin-7 or in fetal thymic organ cultures showed that B and T lymphoid progenitors were also present in the lacZhigh and lacZint fractions. These data provide a functional correlation between SCL expression and colony-forming ability in immature hematopoietic cells. Our data also suggested that expression of SCL was transient and confined to hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells, because the differentiated progeny of most lineages (except the erythroid) were beta-galactosidase-negative.","['Elefanty, A G', 'Begley, C G', 'Metcalf, D', 'Barnett, L', 'Kontgen, F', 'Robb, L']","['Elefanty AG', 'Begley CG', 'Metcalf D', 'Barnett L', 'Kontgen F', 'Robb L']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, P.O.

The mechanisms underlying this phenotype are not fully understood, but there is evidence that some of the properties of BCR/ABL-expressing cells are dependent on the activation of downstream effector molecules such as RAS, PI-3k, and bcl-2. We show here that the small GTP-binding protein Rac is activated by BCR/ABL in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Upon transfection with a vector carrying the dominant-negative N17Rac, BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells retained the resistance to growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis but showed a decrease in proliferative potential in the absence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and markedly reduced invasive properties. Moreover, compared with BCR/ABL-expressing cells, fewer BCR/ABL plus N17Rac double transfectants were capable of homing to bone marrow and spleen. Consistent with these findings, survival of SCID mice injected with the BCR/ABL plus N17Rac double transfectants was markedly prolonged as compared with that of mice injected with BCR/ABL-expressing cells. Together, these data support the important role of a Rac-dependent pathway(s) controlling motility in BCR/ABL-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Skorski, T', 'Wlodarski, P', 'Daheron, L', 'Salomoni, P', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Majewski, M', 'Wasik, M', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Wlodarski P', 'Daheron L', 'Salomoni P', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Majewski M', 'Wasik M', 'Calabretta B']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Blumle Life Science Building 630, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.20.11858 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Sep 29;95(20):11858-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.20.11858.,,['R29 CA70815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC21730,,,,

B cell lymphomas commonly display multiple somatic mutations clustering in the 5'-regulatory region of BCL-6, a proto-oncogene encoding for a POZ/Zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells and required for GC formation. To determine whether BCL-6 mutations represent a tumor-associated phenomenon or reflect a physiologic mechanism, we screened single human tonsillar GC B cells for mutations occurring in the BCL-6 5'-noncoding region and in the Ig variable heavy chain sequences. Thirty percent of GC B cells, but not naive B cells, displayed mutations in the 742 bp region analyzed within the first intron of BCL-6 (overall frequency: 5 x 10(-4)/bp). Accordingly, an expanded survey in lymphoid malignancies showed that BCL-6 mutations are restricted to B cell tumors displaying GC or post-GC phenotype and carrying mutated Ig variable heavy chain sequences. These results indicate that the somatic hypermutation mechanism active in GC B cells physiologically targets non-Ig sequences.","['Pasqualucci, L', 'Migliazza, A', 'Fracchiolla, N', 'William, C', 'Neri, A', 'Baldini, L', 'Chaganti, R S', 'Klein, U', 'Kuppers, R', 'Rajewsky, K', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Pasqualucci L', 'Migliazza A', 'Fracchiolla N', 'William C', 'Neri A', 'Baldini L', 'Chaganti RS', 'Klein U', 'Kuppers R', 'Rajewsky K', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Departments of Pathology and Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Germinal Center/cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.20.11816 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Sep 29;95(20):11816-21. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.20.11816.,,"['CA-44029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-75553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC21723,,,,

To address this fundamental problem in antisense research, we synthesized ""molecular beacon"" (MB) reporter oligodeoxynucleotides with matched fluorescent donor and acceptor chromophores on their 5' and 3' ends. In the absence of a complementary nucleic acid strand, the MB remains in a stem-loop conformation where fluorescence resonance energy transfer prevents signal emission. On hybridization with a complementary sequence, the stem-loop structure opens increasing the physical distance between the donor and acceptor moieties thereby reducing fluorescence resonance energy transfer and allowing a detectable signal to be emitted when the beacon is excited by light of the appropriate wavelength. Solution hybridization studies revealed that in the presence of a complementary strand targeted MB could yield up to a 60-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in comparison to control MB. By using a fluorescence microscope fitted with UV fluoride lenses, the detection limit of preformed MB/target sequence duplexes microinjected into cells was found to be >/=1 x 10(-1) ag of MB, or approximately 10 molecules of mRNA. On the basis of this exquisite sensitivity, real-time detection of MB/target mRNA hybridization in living cells was attempted by microinjecting MB targeted to the vav protooncogene, or control MB, into K562 human leukemia cells. Within 15 min, confocal microscopy revealed fluorescence in cells injected with targeted, but not control, MB. These studies suggest that real-time visualization and localization of oligonucleotide/mRNA interactions is now possible. MB could find utility in studying RNA processing, trafficking, and folding in living cells. We hypothesize that MB may also prove useful for finding targetable mRNA sequence under physiologic conditions.","['Sokol, D L', 'Zhang, X', 'Lu, P', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Sokol DL', 'Zhang X', 'Lu P', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 422 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Naphthalenesulfonates)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '50402-56-7 (5-((2-aminoethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid)', '6268-49-1 (4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'A49L8E13FD (p-Dimethylaminoazobenzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Microinjections', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Naphthalenesulfonates/chemistry', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'p-Dimethylaminoazobenzene/analogs & derivatives/chemistry']",1998/09/30 00:00,1998/09/30 00:01,['1998/09/30 00:00'],"['1998/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.20.11538 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Sep 29;95(20):11538-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.20.11538.,,"['P01 CA072765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA72765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA66731/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC21676,,,,

To date, the prognostic impact of cytarabine dose escalation within various cytogenetic groups of AML has not been assessed. We describe 285 newly diagnosed patients with primary AML who had adequate karyotypes and were enrolled on a prospective Cancer and Leukemia Group B cytogenetic study. All patients were randomly assigned to postremission treatment with standard-, intermediate-, or high-dose cytarabine intensification. Patients were categorized to one of three cytogenetic groups: (a) core binding factor type [(CBF); ie., t(8;21) inv(16), t(16;16), and del(16)]; (b) normal; and (c) other abnormality karyotype. An evaluation of these patients after a median follow-up time of over 7 years was performed to determine the relationship of intensification to outcome by cytogenetic group. Patients included 57 patients with CBF AML, 140 patients with normal karyotype AML, and 88 patients with other cytogenetic abnormalities. The treatment outcome of CBF AML patients was superior, with an estimated 50% still in complete remission (CR) after 5 years as compared with 32 and 15% for patients with normal karyotype AML and other abnormality AML, respectively (P < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed the following nonkaryotype factors to predict a prolonged CR duration: (a) younger age (P < 0.008); (b) lower leukocyte count (P=0.01); (c) the presence of Auer rods (P=0.004); (d) a lower percentage of bone marrow blasts (P=0.001) at the time of diagnosis, (e) and a higher postremission cytarabine dose (P < 0.001). The impact of cytarabine dose on long-term remission was most marked (P < 0.001) in the CBF AML group (after 5 years, 78% of those with a dose of 3 g/m2 were still in CR, 57% of those with a dose of 400 mg/m2 were still in CR, and 16% of those with a dose of 100 mg/m2 were still in CR) followed by normal karyotype AML (P=0.01; after 5 years, 40% of those with a dose of 3 g/m2 were still in CR, 37% of those with a dose of 400 mg/m2 were still in CR, and 20% of those with a dose of 100 mg/m2 were still in CR). In contrast, cytarabine at all doses produced only a 21% or less chance of long-term continuous CR for patients with other cytogenetic abnormalities. A multivariate analysis of CR duration assessed the independent impact of each of these variables on cure. Significant factors entering this model in descending order of importance were cytogenetic group (CBF > normal > other abnormality; P=0.00001), cytarabine dose (3 g/m2 > 400 mg/m2 > 100 mg/m2; P=0.00001), logarithm of leukocyte count at the time of diagnosis (P=0.0005), and histological subtype of AML (P=0.005).

We observed a reduction in dCK activity in a number of CCRF-CEM-derived cell lines that are resistant to these drugs and hypothesized that this reduction is due to DNA methylation of the 5' region of the dCK gene. The DNA methylation state was analyzed at the DNA sequence level after bisulfite modification of genomic DNA. The investigated region included 0.3 kb of DNA upstream to the start site of transcription, exon 1 and part of intron 1. Sensitive cells (CCRF-CEM/0) and three resistant cell lines (CCRF-CEM/CdA4000, CCRF-CEM/CAFdA100 and CCRF-CEM/CAFdA4000) were investigated. The region that was analyzed contained no methylated cytosine residues in the parental cell line CCRF-CEM/0 or in the resistant cell lines.

Stimulation of this network, which has positive and negative regulators, results in the induction or inhibition of certain hematopoietic events. A cytokine can have multiple effects on various cell types, and combinations of cytokines with each other or with other exogenous substances produce more pronounced effects than any cytokine or agent individually. The mechanisms by which cytokines affect normal and leukemic cell growth and viability may vary depending on the target cell or the cytokine(s) in question. Diseases such as leukemia may result from abnormalities in the cytokine network or their receptors. Cytokines play a major role in leukemogenesis. Normally, hematopoietic cells require certain cytokines for their viability and growth. When the viability factors are withdrawn, apoptotic cell death naturally occurs. Prevention of programmed cell death by the abnormal production of a cytokine may release the cell from normal growth control leading to malignant transformation. Disregulation of genes for hematopoietic growth factors and their receptors may be one of the events that leads to leukemogenesis through an aberrant autocrine growth mechanism. However, cytokines have been used as therapeutic agents in various ways. Differentiation therapy has been widely investigated and proven effective in certain types of cancer. Gene therapy, where the cytokine cDNA is used to reduce tumorigenicity and/or increase immunogenicity is promising. Another kind of therapy using alkylated growth factors has been under focus. This review summarizes the actions and interactions of cytokines that are related to leukemic cell viability and growth. The use of cytokines as therapeutic agents is also discussed.","['Moqattash, S', 'Lutton, J D']","['Moqattash S', 'Lutton JD']","['Department of Human and Clinical Anatomy, College of Medicine, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. moqatash@gto.net.om']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Heavy infiltrations of CD20+ cells with lambda light chain restriction were found in the synovial tissue. Sequencing demonstrated overexpansion of a single B cell clone (DP58/D/J(H)4b and IGLV3S2/Jlambda2-Jlambda3 for V(H) and V(L), respectively) in the peripheral blood. Identical V(H) and V(L) rearrangements were found in the synovial infiltrates. Somatic mutations were found in both the peripheral blood and the synovial clone.

In contrast, TNFalpha, interferon-gamma, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were rarely found in the synovial infiltrates.

Overexpression of Pgp may result in multidrug resistance (MDR). Modulators can block Pgp efflux and sensitize multidrug resistant cells to these oncolytics. To study the interaction of modulators with Pgp, Pgp-ATPase activity was examined, using plasma membranes isolated from the multidrug-resistant cell line CEM/VLB100. A survey of modulators indicated that verapamil, trifluoperazine, and nicardipine stimulated ATPase activity by 1.3- to 1.8-fold, whereas two others, trimethoxybenzoylyohimbine (TMBY) and vindoline, had no effect. Further evaluation showed that TMBY completely blocked the stimulation by verapamil of ATPase activity by competitive inhibition, with a Ki of 2.1 microM. When the effects of these two modulators on the formation of the enzyme-nucleotide complex important in the catalytic cycle were examined, verapamil increased the amount of vanadate-trapped 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP bound to Pgp by two-fold, whereas TMBY had no effect. Moreover, TMBY blocked the verapamil stimulation of vanadate-8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP. Together, these data indicate that verapamil and TMBY bind to Pgp at a common site or overlapping sites, but only verapamil results in enhanced Pgp-ATP hydrolysis and formation of the vanadate-nucleotide-enzyme complex.","['Shepard, R L', 'Winter, M A', 'Hsaio, S C', 'Pearce, H L', 'Beck, W T', 'Dantzig, A H']","['Shepard RL', 'Winter MA', 'Hsaio SC', 'Pearce HL', 'Beck WT', 'Dantzig AH']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285-0424, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (trimethoxybenzoylyohimbine)', '2Y49VWD90Q (Yohimbine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', ""53696-59-6 (8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Azides/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Protein Conformation', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Yohimbine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1998/09/29 00:00,1998/09/29 00:01,['1998/09/29 00:00'],"['1998/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00212-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00212-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Sep 15;56(6):719-27. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00212-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By investigating a series of derivatives of oxatomide with different inhibiting activities on exocytosis, we aimed to evaluate the role of their effects on the early steps of the signal transduction cascade in the inhibition of exocytosis. The active compounds induced hyperphosphorylation of tyrosine residues both in stimulated as well as in resting cells. Furthermore, some elevation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation upon antigen activation was observed for the active derivatives. Ca2+ fluxes were also studied. The inhibition of the antigen-induced 45Ca2+ influx correlated with the effects of the drugs on exocytosis. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity on antigen- and thapsigargin-mediated exocytosis correlated well. Adherence of the cells to fibronectin, stimulating cellular integrin receptors, was synergistic to antigen activation of the RBL cells. However, oxatomide did lack any effect on integrin-mediated processes, as the IC50 value for exocytosis was identical for fibronectin-adhered cells and standard cultured cells. We conclude that oxatomide and its analogs inhibit exocytosis, mainly by inhibiting Ca2+ influx over store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels. The drugs have a direct effect on the store-operated Ca2+ channels or affect the direct regulation of these channels.","['Paulussen, J J', 'Fischer, M J', 'Roozendaal, R L', 'van der Heijden, V C', 'van Dijken, P', 'de Mol, N J', 'Janssen, L H']","['Paulussen JJ', 'Fischer MJ', 'Roozendaal RL', 'van der Heijden VC', 'van Dijken P', 'de Mol NJ', 'Janssen LH']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'J31IL9Z2EE (oxatomide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism/physiology', 'Calcium Radioisotopes', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1998/09/29 00:00,1998/09/29 00:01,['1998/09/29 00:00'],"['1998/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00038-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00038-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Sep 15;56(6):693-701. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00038-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inappropriate apoptosis may underlie the pathogenesis of immunodeficiencies, as well as pathogenesis and drug/radiation resistance of human leukemias and lymphomas, which makes control of apoptosis an important potential target for therapeutic interventions. Therefore, identification of the molecular regulators of apoptosis is an area of intense investigation. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is the first tyrosine kinase to be identified as a dual-function regulator of apoptosis, which promotes radiation-induced apoptosis but inhibits Fas-activated apoptosis in B-cells. BTK functions in a pro-apoptotic manner when B-cells are exposed to reactive oxygen intermediates, at least in part, by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic activity of STAT-3 transcription factor. In contrast, BTK associates with the death receptor Fas and impairs its interaction with Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), which is essential for the recruitment and activation of FLICE by Fas during the apoptotic signal, thereby preventing the assembly of a pro-apoptotic death inducing signaling complex (DISC) after Fas-ligation. The identification of BTK as a dual-function regulator of apoptosis will significantly increase our understanding of both the biological processes involved in programmed cell death and the diseases associated with dysregulation of apoptosis. New agents with BTK-modulatory activity may have clinical potential in the treatment of B-cell malignancies (in particular acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer), as well as B-cell immunodeficiencies.","['Uckun, F M']",['Uckun FM'],"['Wayne Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology']",1998/09/29 00:00,1998/09/29 00:01,['1998/09/29 00:00'],"['1998/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00122-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00122-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Sep 15;56(6):683-91. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00122-1.,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that better control of acute GVHD and treatment of early stage complications are clearly important to improving the outcome of BMTs from unrelated donors, especially for high and super-high risk patients.","['Sao, H', 'Kitaori, K', 'Kasai, M', 'Shimokawa, T', 'Kato, H', 'Hayakawa, M', 'Kato, C', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Kamiya, Y', 'Yanada, M', 'Morishima, Y']","['Sao H', 'Kitaori K', 'Kasai M', 'Shimokawa T', 'Kato H', 'Hayakawa M', 'Kato C', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Kamiya Y', 'Yanada M', 'Morishima Y']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Meitetsu Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/29 00:00,1998/09/29 00:01,['1998/09/29 00:00'],"['1998/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1998 Jul;39(7):473-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective review of records of oncology unit patients requiring general surgical consultation for abdominal complaints in a 1-year period. SETTING: Oncology unit of a tertiary care, university teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients diagnosed as having neutropenic enterocolitis were managed conservatively with operation reserved for failure of conservative therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data from patients at the time of presentation and during treatment for neutropenic enterocolitis. RESULTS: All 14 patients diagnosed as having neutropenic enterocolitis were receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or leukemias. Seven patients were undergoing stem cell or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Presenting symptoms and physical examination findings were nonspecific. All patients except one had neutropenia at the time of diagnosis. Computed tomographic scans of the abdomen were the most useful confirmatory study for the diagnosis of neutropenic enterocolitis. All patients except one had resolution of neutropenic enterocolitis with conservative therapy. One patient whose course of conservative management failed had protracted neutropenia and required operation for resection of bowel with full-thickness necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Neutropenic enterocolitis has evolved from a complication of patients with leukemia to a disease of patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy for many malignancies, solid as well as hematologic. Diagnosis of neutropenic enterocolitis continues to be a challenge, as patients typically present with nonspecific gastrointestinal tract symptoms. Neutropenia and computed tomographic scan findings are useful adjuncts in diagnosing neutropenic enterocolitis. Timely conservative treatment frequently allows resolution of neutropenic enterocolitis without operation.","['Song, H K', 'Kreisel, D', 'Canter, R', 'Krupnick, A S', 'Stadtmauer, E A', 'Buzby, G']","['Song HK', 'Kreisel D', 'Canter R', 'Krupnick AS', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Buzby G']","['Department of Surgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Surg,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",9716528,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Enterocolitis/complications/*diagnosis/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archsurg.133.9.979 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Surg. 1998 Sep;133(9):979-82. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.133.9.979.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study analyses the role of spontaneous bioelectrical activity (SBA) and neurotrophic factors on the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in rat visual cortical neurons using organotypic monocultures prepared from newborn animals and in situ hybridization to detect the NPY messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Spontaneously active cortex cultures display NPY mRNA expression in about 7% of all cortical neurons from 10 days in vitro (DIV) on. Blocking the SBA by chronic application of 10 mM Mg2+ for 3-30 DIV reduces the percentage of NPY neurons to about 2%. Allowing an initial phase of SBA (1-20 DIV) followed by an SBA blockade (for 21-50 DIV) results in 2% labelled neurons, indicating a dramatic reduction of NPY mRNA expression in the absence of SBA. Surprisingly, the reverse experiment (a period of SBA blockade for 1-20 DIV followed by a period of SBA recovery for 21-40 DIV) does not cause an upregulation of NPY mRNA expression. However, allowing cultures to differentiate as spontaneously active cultures, then applying a transient period of SBA blockade which is followed by a second period of SBA, does rescue the NPY mRNA expression in 7% of the cortical neurons. We conclude that SBA is a main trigger for NPY mRNA expression and it is particularly important during an early postnatal period of differentiation. We then analysed whether neurotrophic factors known to modulate cortical neuropeptide expression are able to do so in the absence of SBA. Supplementing chronically blocked cultures with the neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) and the cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), reveals that BDNF and NT-3 are unable to increase the percentage of NPY neurons. In contrast, LIF and NT-4/5 increase the percentage of NPY neurons to 4 and 6-7%, respectively. Moreover, neurons treated with NT-4/5 display a very high level of NPY mRNA expression in somata and in the dendritic trees. The data suggest a complex interplay and a hierarchy of epigenetic factors in regulating the neurochemical architecture of the developing neocortex.","['Wirth, M J', 'Obst, K', 'Wahle, P']","['Wirth MJ', 'Obst K', 'Wahle P']","['AG Entwicklungsneurobiologie, Fakultat fur Biologie, Ruhr-Universitat, Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '145172-44-7 (neurotrophin 5)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",IM,"['Action Potentials/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Neocortex/drug effects', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/*genetics', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Visual Cortex/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00157.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1998 Apr;10(4):1457-64. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00157.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cutaneous sensory neurones of the trigeminal ganglion, which show an early, transient survival response to BDNF and NT3 before becoming NGF-dependent, were supported by CNTF, LIF, OSM and CT-1 during the late fetal period, several days after the neurones become NGF-dependent. At this stage of development, these cytokines promoted the survival of a subset of NGF-responsive neurones. The enteroceptive neurones of the nodose ganglion, which retain dependence on BDNF throughout fetal development, were supported throughout their development by CNTF, LIF, OSM and CT-1, and displayed an additional survival response to IL-6 in the late fetal period. These findings indicate that populations of sensory neurones display different developmental patterns of cytokine responsiveness and show that embryonic trigeminal neurones pass through several phases of differing neurotrophic factor survival requirements.","['Horton, A R', 'Barlett, P F', 'Pennica, D', 'Davies, A M']","['Horton AR', 'Barlett PF', 'Pennica D', 'Davies AM']","['School of Biological and Medical Sciences, Bute Medical Buildings, University of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'Brain/*cytology/*growth & development', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/*drug effects', 'Nodose Ganglion/cytology/drug effects/growth & development', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/cytology/drug effects/growth & development']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00079.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 1998 Feb;10(2):673-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00079.x.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy was given in 28-day cycles (AAB, AAB), with cycle A = vincristine (0.065 mg/kg) intravenously on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (65 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1, and cycle B = cisplatinum (4 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and etoposide (6.5 mg/kg) intravenously on days 3 and 4. Five of the 198 children developed second malignancies, with a cumulative risk at 8 years of 11.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-39%). Four of the five second malignancies occurred in children younger than 2 years of age at diagnosis, with a cumulative risk at 8 years of 18.9% (CI, 0-70%).

We report a case of successful pregnancy in a patient who received high-dose whole-body irradiation (WBI) (1,575 cGy) as part of her treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE: A 26-year-old woman received high-dose cyclophosphamide accompanied by high-dose (1,575 cGy) WBI as part of her treatment for AML when she was 23 years of age. The patient received oral contraceptives before, during and after treatment. After WBI, the patient developed ovarian failure and amenorrhea, which was confirmed by hormonal evaluation. The amenorrhea persisted for one year. No recurrence of AML was found. The patient was placed on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) because of vasomotor changes. An unexpected pregnancy occurred 14 months later; HRT was discontinued. The patient delivered a normal female infant at 38 weeks of gestation. The infant was followed for eight months; her development appeared to be normal. CONCLUSION: In this case report, it is unclear whether pregnancy resulted from active folliculogenesis remote from radiation therapy or from possible ovarian protection rendered by the use of oral contraceptives. The benefit of oral contraceptives in protecting the ovary from radiation injury is unknown and remains an area for future research.","['Chao, H T', 'Wang, P H', 'Yuan, C C', 'Lee, W L']","['Chao HT', 'Wang PH', 'Yuan CC', 'Lee WL']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Reprod Med,The Journal of reproductive medicine,0173343,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Contraceptives, Oral/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy', 'Ovary/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Remission Induction', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Reprod Med. 1998 Aug;43(8):703-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of bone marrow transplantation after total body irradiation can be understood in terms of tumour cell killing, engraftment, and normal tissue damage, each of these endpoints being influenced by irradiation-, disease-, transplant-, and patient-related factors. Interpretation of clinical data is further hampered by the overwhelming influence of logistic constraints, the small numbers of randomised studies, and the concomitant variations in total dose and fraction size or dose rate. So far, three cautious conclusions can be drawn in order to tentatively adapt the total body irradiation schedule to clinically-relevant situations. Firstly, the organs at risk for normal tissue damage (lung, liver, lens, kidney) are protected by delivering small doses per fraction at low dose rate. This suggests that, when toxicity is at stake (e.g., in children), fractionated irradiation should be preferred, provided that interfraction intervals are long enough. Secondly, fractionated irradiation should be avoided in case of T-cell depleted transplant, given the high risk of graft rejection in this setting. An alternative would be to increase total (or fractional) dose of fractionated total body irradiation, but this approach is likely to induce more normal tissue toxicity. Thirdly, clinical data have shown higher relapse rates in chronic myeloid leukaemia after fractionated or low dose rate total body irradiation, suggesting that fractionated irradiation should not be recommended, unless total (or fractional) dose is increased. Total body irradiation-containing regimens, primarily cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation, are either equivalent to or better than the chemotherapy-only regimens, primarily busulfan/cyclophosphamide.

In some in vitro studies a relation has been observed between topo I, IIalpha or IIbeta expression and sensitivity to topo inhibitors. Drug resistance to topo inhibitors may, however, be multifactorial. Several topo inhibitors are substrates for drug membrane transporters. As most topo inhibitors are cell cycle specific, disturbances in cell cycle regulation can also confer resistance, and downstream events following DNA damage induced by topo inhibitors may be involved in regulating cell death or survival. Several studies in patient specimens have shown a relation between topo IIalpha expression and the proliferative state of the tumor, higher topo IIalpha levels being seen in more highly proliferating tumor types. In contrast, topo IIbeta appears to be expressed in both proliferating and quiescent cells. Furthermore, higher topo I levels were observed in some tumors when compared to their normal counterparts. In some studies a reduced topo IIalpha level was seen in samples taken after chemotherapy treatment, as compared with specimens prior to treatment. No unequivocal relation was observed, however, between expression or activity of the topo genes and response to chemotherapy; nonetheless only a few studies have properly addressed this question. This review summarizes the results of the clinical studies performed so far, and analyzes the critical issues in performing studies on patient material.","['Dingemans, A M', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Giaccone, G']","['Dingemans AM', 'Pinedo HM', 'Giaccone G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4781(98)00141-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(98)00141-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Oct 1;1400(1-3):275-88. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(98)00141-9.,,,,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two forms of treatment-related AML (t-AML). Each form has a de novo counterpart. Alkylating agents cause t-AML characterized by antecedent myelodysplasia, a mean latency period of 5-7 years and complete or partial deletion of chromosome 5 or 7. The risk is related to cumulative alkylating agent dose. Germline NF-1 and p53 gene mutations and the GSTT1 null genotype may increase the risk. Epipodophyllotoxins and other DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors cause leukemias with translocations of the MLL gene at chromosome band 11q23 or, less often, t(8;21), t(3;21), inv(16), t(8;16), t(15;17) or t(9;22). The mean latency period is about 2 years. While most cases are of French-American-British (FAB) M4 or FAB M5 morphology, other FAB AML subtypes, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) occur. Between 2 and 12% of patients who receive epipodophyllotoxin have developed t-AML. There is no relationship with higher cumulative epipodophyllotoxin dose and genetic predisposition has not been identified, but weekly or twice-weekly schedules and preceding l-asparaginase administration may potentiate the risk. The translocation breakpoints in MLL are heterogeneously distributed within a breakpoint cluster region (bcr) and the MLL gene translocations involve one of many partner genes. DNA topoisomerase II cleavage assays demonstrate a correspondence between DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites and the translocation breakpoints. DNA topoisomerase II catalyzes transient double-stranded DNA cleavage and rejoining. Epipodophyllotoxins form a complex with the DNA and DNA topoisomerase II, decrease DNA rejoining and cause chromosomal breakage. Furthermore, epipodophyllotoxin metabolism generates reactive oxygen species and hydroxyl radicals that could create abasic sites, potent position-specific enhancers of DNA topoisomerase II cleavage. One proposed mechanism for the translocations entails chromosomal breakage by DNA topoisomerase II and recombination of DNA free ends from different chromosomes through DNA repair. With few exceptions, treatment-related leukemias respond less well to either chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation than their de novo counterparts, necessitating more innovative treatments, a better mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis, and strategies for prevention.","['Felix, C A']",['Felix CA'],"[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Abramson Research Center, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. felix@kermit.oncol.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Podophyllotoxin/therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4781(98)00139-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(98)00139-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Oct 1;1400(1-3):233-55. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(98)00139-0.,,['R29CA66140-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Postganglionic sympathetic axotomy leads to a prolonged leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors. To study regulation of LIF-dependent activation of STAT proteins and to mimic the loss of target-derived NGF resulting from postganglionic axotomy in vivo, SCG were explanted into media lacking NGF and activation of STAT proteins was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Like postganglionic axotomy in vivo. STAT proteins were activated for up to 8 days after explantation of SCG in vitro. SCG cultured in the presence of NGF showed decreased STAT binding when compared to ganglia cultured in NGF-free media. This inhibition of STAT activation by NGF was only present in ganglia cultured for more than 5 days and was mimicked by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The serine kinase inhibitor H7 augmented the increase of STAT binding produced by explantation, suggesting the presence of a labile repressor of STAT activation in the SCG. These data indicated that the neuropoietic cytokine-signaling pathway interacts with neurotrophin and H7-sensitive-signaling pathways to regulate activation of STAT proteins in sympathetic neurons. Moreover, these data suggest that one of the mechanisms leading to prolonged activation of STAT proteins after postganglionic axotomy in vivo is loss of target-derived neurotrophins.","['Rajan, P', 'Gearan, T', 'Fink, J S']","['Rajan P', 'Gearan T', 'Fink JS']","['Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA. rajan@codon.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Axotomy', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Male', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology']",1998/09/28 00:00,1998/09/28 00:01,['1998/09/28 00:00'],"['1998/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(98)00611-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00611-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1998 Aug 17;802(1-2):198-204. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00611-8.,,"['MH-11205/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The other two adjacent regions designated as region C (-4464/-4445) showed no known consensus binding sites, and their specific placental JEG-3 nuclear extract binding was not evident in nonplacental nuclear extracts and was not competed by a trophoblast specific element (TSE), indicating that region C is a novel placenta-specific element (PSE, CATTTCCTGAACTAGTTTTT). Footprinting localized the binding boundary of PSE-binding protein (PSEB), and three Gs were found to be important for specific PSE binding. UV cross-linking showed that PSEB had a molecular mass of approximately 160 kDa, substituting the PSE with two previously reported placenta elements TSE or chorionic somatomammotropin enhancer factor 1 (CSEF-1) motifs resulted in markedly different promoter activities, indicating that PSEB is indeed different from TSE binding protein or CSEF-1. These results are the first demonstration that a novel PSE is the major element for placenta-specific enhancer activity in human LIFR gene.","['Wang, Z', 'Melmed, S']","['Wang Z', 'Melmed S']","['Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (HCFC1 protein, human)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (SNAPC protein complex, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Host Cell Factor C1', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection/genetics']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.40.26069 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59924-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 2;273(40):26069-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.40.26069.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25944-25952). These cells were found to have two point mutations in the reduced folate carrier (RFC), resulting in a replacement of isoleucine 48 by phenylalanine and of tryptophan 105 by glycine. Each mutation contributes to the resistance phenotype. Genomic DNA from resistant cells contained both the wild-type and mutant alleles, but wild-type message was not detected. Folic acid was a much better substrate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was a poorer substrate for transport in L1210/D3 cells relative to L1210 cells. Enhanced transport of folic acid was due to a marked, approximately 20-fold, decrease in the influx Km. Influx of methotrexate and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate were minimally altered. Transfection of mutated rfc cDNA into RFC-null L1210/A cells produced the substrate specificity and 5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate resistance observed in the L1210/D3 line. Transfection of the mutant cDNA into wild-type cells also conferred resistance to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate. We conclude that the I48F and W105G mutations in RFC caused resistance to 5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, that the region of the RFC protein near these two positions defines the substrate-binding site, that the wild-type allele was silenced during the multistep development of resistance, and that this mutant phenotype represents a genetically dominant trait.","['Tse, A', 'Brigle, K', 'Taylor, S M', 'Moran, R G']","['Tse A', 'Brigle K', 'Taylor SM', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.40.25953 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59910-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 2;273(40):25953-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.40.25953.,,['CA 27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug-resistant phenotype selected was conditional to the folate compound used to support growth: grown on folic acid cells were 400-fold resistant, whereas they were 2.5-fold more sensitive to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate than wild-type L1210 cells when grown on folinic acid. In folic acid-containing media, polyglutamation of 5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate was markedly reduced, yet folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity was not different from that in parental L1210 cells. Resistance was due to two changes in membrane transport: a minor increase in the Km for 5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate influx, and a major increase in folic acid transport. Enhanced folic acid transport resulted in an expanded cellular content of folates which blocked polyglutamation of 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate. We propose that polyglutamation of 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate is limited by feedback inhibition by cellular folates on folylpolyglutamate synthetase, an effect which reflects a mechanism in place to control the level of cellular folates. Although the primary alteration causative of resistance is different from those reported previously, all 5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolate resistance phenotypes result in decreased drug polyglutamation, reflecting the centrality of this reaction to the action of 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate.","['Tse, A', 'Moran, R G']","['Tse A', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Feedback/physiology', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics', 'Mice', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.40.25944 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59909-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Oct 2;273(40):25944-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.40.25944.,,['CA 27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified in the presence of competitive templates for RFC and beta-actin. RFC transcripts were normalized to transcripts for beta-actin. In a series of K562 sublines, a approximately 30-fold range of RFC transcripts measured by PCR assay closely agreed with results of Northern analysis and varied in proportion to RFC protein on Western blots and [3H]methotrexate transport. RFC transcripts varied over a 88-fold range in 49 specimens from 48 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Median RFC transcripts were similar for 15 T-cell and 33 B-precursor ALL samples (RFC/beta-actin = 6.13 x 10(-3) and 7.92 x 10(-3), respectively) and for 41 diagnostic (7.20 x 10(-3)) and 8 relapse (5.58 x 10(-3)) samples. Whereas PCR measurements of RFC transcripts approximated changes in methotrexate transport in B-precursor ALL blasts (n = 10), for T-ALL blasts (n = 12) there was no apparent relationship between these parameters. For hyperdiploid B-precursor blasts (n = 11) with greater than 52 chromosomes and three to five copies of chromosome 21, the median RFC transcript level was approximately 3-fold higher than that for diploid B-precursor blasts. RFC transcripts were also elevated for two of three B-precursor specimens with acquired trisomy 21. Our results suggest that RFC gene expression is far more predictive of methotrexate uptake capacity in B-precursor than T-ALL and that increased copies of chromosome 21 in B-precursor ALL blasts are generally associated with increased RFC transcripts. Hence, the good prognosis for children with hyperdiploid B-precursor ALL treated with antimetabolite-based chemotherapy and the high levels of methotrexate and methotrexate polyglutamates accumulated may, in part, reflect elevated RFC gene expression and capacities for methotrexate transport.","['Zhang, L', 'Taub, J W', 'Williamson, M', 'Wong, S C', 'Hukku, B', 'Pullen, J', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Matherly, L H']","['Zhang L', 'Taub JW', 'Williamson M', 'Wong SC', 'Hukku B', 'Pullen J', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Matherly LH']","['Experimental and Clinical Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Ploidies', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Sep;4(9):2169-77.,,"['R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between these two variables and to propose a unified conceptual framework for the construct and interpretation of clinical trials. Definitions and variables with respect to dose include potency, therapeutic index, standard dose, efficacy, relative efficacy, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), dose rate, dose density, dose intensity, and fractional dose intensity. Our overarching concept, that is, summation dose intensity (SDI), was calculated in several ways, depending upon the nature of the data, and included the relative efficacy method, the unit regimen method, and the high dose method. The SDI concept was then applied to disease categories and strategies to determine its usefulness and effectiveness in integrating dose and combinations. The tumors and settings were: mustargen-vincristine-procarbazine-prednisone in Hodgkin's disease, combination chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia in children, metastatic breast cancer including dose and combinations, selected other solid tumors, alternating chemotherapy, and high dose studies in the leukemias and lymphomas. SDI was effective in integrating and quantifying dose and combination chemotherapy. For classical AAs, the implication of SDI for the construct and analysis of clinical trials was emphasized. In addition to new drug development, emphasis should be given to reducing or eliminating DLTs, such as those of the marrow, now and, in the future, those of the gastrointestinal tract toxicity and other DLTs. The above was derived from and applies to the classical AAs. Whether they will apply to, with appropriate adjustment, agents with significantly different dose-response curves, such as biotherapeutics and hormonal agents, remains to be determined.","['Frei, E 3rd', 'Elias, A', 'Wheeler, C', 'Richardson, P', 'Hryniuk, W']","['Frei E 3rd', 'Elias A', 'Wheeler C', 'Richardson P', 'Hryniuk W']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",1998/09/25 02:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/09/25 02:03'],"['1998/09/25 02:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 02:03 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Sep;4(9):2027-37.,,,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the parasitised B-sarcoma TBL3, AP-1 induction occurs in the absence of any JNK activity. In contrast, in infected macrophage and B-cell lines, AP-1 transcriptional activity is strictly associated with the parasite-induced constitutive activation of JNK and subsequent c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation.

Microinjection of cyclin D3-neutralizing antibody inhibited G1/S transition in human (IMR-90) and rat (R12) diploid fibroblasts, indicating that analogous to cyclins D1 and D2, cyclin D3 is essential for timely progression through G1. In contrast to cyclins D1 and D2, cyclin D3 was (i) ubiquitously expressed among a panel of 70 human cultured cell types; (ii) strongly upregulated upon induction of HL-60 leukaemia cells to differentiate; and (iii) accumulated to high levels in a wide range of quiescent cell types in mouse and human differentiated tissues. Complementary analyses of human biopsies and mouse tissues at different stages of foetal and postnatal development revealed lineage-dependent transient or long-term accumulation of the cyclin D3 protein, correlating with initiation/establishment or maintenance of the mature phenotypes, respectively.

Bcr-Abl contains several autophosphorylation sites which serve as potential docking sites for SH2-containing signaling molecules. Mutational analysis has indicated that these autophosphorylation sites play a critical role in the transforming capability of Bcr-Abl. It has been shown that the SH2-containing adapter protein Grb2 binds to the autophosphorylation site Tyr(p)177 whereby it couples Bcr-Abl to the Ras pathway. The biological consequences of this interaction, however, are presently unclear. A Tyr177-mutated Bcr-Abl which lacks the ability to interact with the Grb2-SH2 domain still transforms myeloid cells and generates tumors in nude mice. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify signaling proteins which bind to distinct Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation sites. Autophosphorylation of Bcr-Abl in yeast was accomplished by using the DNA binding protein LexA which permits dimerization and crossphosphorylation of the fused bait. Using a LexA-Bcr-Abl full length fusion protein as bait, we identified several SH2-containing proteins. Among them we confirmed molecules already shown by others to interact with Bcr-Abl, in vivo, including Grb2, PI-3-kinase and Crk indicating that dimerization in yeast leads to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues crucial for Bcr-Abl signaling in vivo. More importantly, we identified the SH2-containing protein Grb10 as a new binding partner for Bcr-Abl. This binding occurs in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner at Bcr sites of Bcr-Abl. Both Abl and Bcr alone, as well as a kinase-defective Bcr-Abl, failed to interact with Grb10 in yeast. Mutational analysis uncovered a new SH2 binding site in Bcr-Abl located between Bcr aa242-446, which is different from the Grb2 binding site. Binding could be demonstrated in vitro and also in vivo as shown by co-immunoprecipitation analysis in CML cells. Using a temperature sensitive Bcr-Abl stably overexpressed in hematopoetic cells, we demonstrated that complex formation of Grb10 with Bcr-Abl was kinase activation-dependent in vivo. Notably, a Bcr-Abl mutant protein (Bcr/1-242-Abl) which lacks the ability to interact with Grb10 partially alleviated IL-3 dependence of Ba/F3 cells, indicating that the Grb10/Bcr-Abl interaction is important for Bcr-Abl-induced IL-3 independence of Ba/F3 cells. In addition, the Bcr/1-242-Abl mutant has a reduced capacity to induce focus formation in fibroblasts.","['Bai, R Y', 'Jahn, T', 'Schrem, S', 'Munzert, G', 'Weidner, K M', 'Wang, J Y', 'Duyster, J']","['Bai RY', 'Jahn T', 'Schrem S', 'Munzert G', 'Weidner KM', 'Wang JY', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proteins)', '151441-47-3 (GRB10 Adaptor Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'GRB10 Adaptor Protein', 'Genetic Vectors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*src Homology Domains']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202024 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Aug 27;17(8):941-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202024.,,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To validate those findings, we conducted immunohistochemical analyses of erbB-2 and p53 protein expression in an additional cohort of 595 patients (set B) from CALGB 8541, as well as a molecular analysis of erbB-2 gene amplification in tumors from all patients (sets A and B). Marker data were compared with clinical, histologic, treatment, and outcome data. RESULTS: Updated analyses of data from set A (median follow-up, 10.4 years) showed an even stronger interaction between erbB-2 expression and CAF dose, by use of either immunohistochemical or molecular data. A similar interaction between erbB-2 expression and CAF dose was observed in all 992 patients, analyzed as a single group. However, for set B alone (median follow-up, 8.2 years), results varied with the method of statistical analysis. By use of a proportional hazards model, the erbB-2 expression-CAF dose interaction was not significant for all patients. However, in the subgroups of patients randomly assigned to the high- or the moderate-dose arms, significance was achieved. When patient data were adjusted for differences by use of a prognostic index (to balance an apparent failure of randomization in the low-dose arm), the erbB-2 expression-CAF dose interaction was significant in all patients from the validation set B as well. An interaction was also observed between p53 immunopositivity and CAF dose. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that patients whose breast tumors exhibit high erbB-2 expression benefit from dose-intensive CAF should be further validated before clinical implementation. Interactions between erbB-2 expression, p53 expression, and CAF dose underscore the complexities of predictive markers where multiple interactions may confound the outcome.","['Thor, A D', 'Berry, D A', 'Budman, D R', 'Muss, H B', 'Kute, T', 'Henderson, I C', 'Barcos, M', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Edgerton, S', 'Allred, C', 'Norton, L', 'Liu, E T']","['Thor AD', 'Berry DA', 'Budman DR', 'Muss HB', 'Kute T', 'Henderson IC', 'Barcos M', 'Cirrincione C', 'Edgerton S', 'Allred C', 'Norton L', 'Liu ET']","['Evanston Hospital and Northwestern University, IL 60201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*chemistry/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.18.1346 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Sep 16;90(18):1346-60. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.18.1346.,,"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Sep 16;90(18):1320-1.

This new emphasis has stimulated progress in several areas. Recent findings suggest that poor early responses to therapy and detection of minimal residual disease at the postremission induction period by immunologic methods are reliable indicators of an adverse prognosis warranting modification of treatment. In this regard, timely administration of intensified chemotherapy, including a second reinduction/intensification phase, may nullify the adverse prognosis conferred by a delayed response to induction therapy. Comparative analysis of survival outcomes in T-cell patients who received chemotherapy or cranial irradiation (12 Gy) to prevent overt leukemia in the central nervous system suggests that the latter modality should be retained for cases with leukocyte counts > 100 x 10(9)/L. Recent innovations in histocompatibility matching, prevention of graft-versus-host disease, and antiviral prophylaxis have enhanced the applicability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, making this procedure available to candidates lacking matched sibling donors. Finally, demonstration that acute lymphoblastic leukemia has an angiogenic phase in bone marrow raises the possibility of effective treatment with antiangiogenic agents, such as endostatin. Remaining challenges in the treatment of childhood leukemia include 1) the development of specific and more effective therapy for high-risk cases and 2) the reduction of long-term complications associated with intensive chemotherapy and cranial irradiation.","['Pui, C H']",['Pui CH'],"[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Radiotherapy', 'Recurrence']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-199807000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 1998 Jul;5(4):292-301. doi: 10.1097/00062752-199807000-00009.,,"['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Irradiation (lambda exc = 355 nm) of cells in the presence of thiopyridone esters, specific photolytic precursors of sulfur-, carbon- and oxygen-centered radicals, caused toxicity that was unambiguously demonstrated to result from radical photosensitization mechanisms. Cellular morphological changes were observed following irradiation but apoptosis was not found to take place. A good correlation was evident between lipid peroxidation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid method, and phototoxicity, assessed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, indicating that the ester derivatives exert their effects mainly in plasma and/or subcellular membranes. Irradiation performed under deaerated conditions also induced significant phototoxicity but the effects of deaeration were dependent on the ester used and are discussed in terms of the nature of the primary radical species generated in each case. Irradiation of L1210 cells in the presence of N-hydroxypyridine-2(1H)-thione, a nonspecific, photochemical source of hydroxyl radical, was also found to trigger phototoxicity and lipid peroxidation. However in this case, photodamage cannot yet be definitely attributed to a radical or type II mechanism although the apparent oxygen independence of phototoxicity would indicate that type II contribution is not significant.","['Aveline, B M', 'Redmond, R W']","['Aveline BM', 'Redmond RW']","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Dermatology, Boston 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'U86ZGC74V5 (Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/*chemistry', 'Free Radicals', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Light/adverse effects', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*radiation effects', 'Liposomes/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Photolysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1998 Sep;68(3):266-75.,,['R01 CA68524 A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the bacterial lacZ gene as a model, all three sites of the mouse (skeletal muscle, dermis of abdominal skin or of the ear pinna) could express the gene product beta-gal but varied in expression time with muscle tissue showing the longest expression. Expression time, however, did not correlate with immune response intensity. The ear pinna was by far the most effective and muscle the least effective priming site for specific humoral and cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune responses. Following intra-pinna DNA inoculation, beta-gal expressing cells were detectable around the injection site and in the major draining lymph node. Efficiency of immunization was also dependent on the promoter and expression vector used. The cytomegalus virus promoter driven pCMV beta vector was superior to the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR driven BAG vector. LacZ DNA immunization was also compared with cell-based vaccination with lacZ-transfected tumor cells, in which case again the pinna was the best site for inducing strong immune responses. Tumor-specific T cell responses could also be well induced in the pinna, leading to cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction and protective antitumor immunity. Thus, the pinna was found to be a privileged site for induction of antitumor responses and for genetic immunization, an important finding of immediate practical and potential future clinical implications.","['Forg, P', 'von Hoegen, P', 'Dalemans, W', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Forg P', 'von Hoegen P', 'Dalemans W', 'Schirrmacher V']","['German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Division of Cellular Immunology, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Vaccines, DNA)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', '*Ear, External', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lac Operon', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Skin', 'Vaccines, DNA/*administration & dosage', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300628 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1998 Jun;5(6):789-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300628.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DISCUSSION: We attributed this blueberry muffin baby syndrome to T cell proliferation but we were unable to distinguish between extramedullary leukopoiesis and leukemia. Despite the absence of systematic disease and the complete regression, no exact diagnosis and prognosis could be established in the case. The association of blueberry muffin baby syndrome with a polymalformative syndrome was probably related to a genetic anomaly on chromosome 20 not previously reported.","['Zenon, C', 'Bouffioux, B', 'Louis, J']","['Zenon C', 'Bouffioux B', 'Louis J']","['Service de Dermatologie, Clinique Notre-Dame, Charleroi.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Cryptorchidism/genetics/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/genetics', 'Histiocytosis/congenital', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/congenital', 'Macrostomia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Polydactyly/genetics/*pathology', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Skin Diseases, Papulosquamous/*congenital/genetics/*pathology', 'Syndrome']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AD-03-1998-125-3-0151-9638-101019-ART97 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1998 Mar;125(3):199-201.,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Blueberry muffin baby"".",,,,,,,

Cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and other agents can rescue neutrophils from apoptosis but the molecular mechanisms involved in this rescue are undefined. Here, we show by Western blotting that human neutrophils do not express Bcl-2 or Bcl-X but constitutively express Bax. However, cellular levels of these proteins are unaffected by agents which either accelerate or delay neutrophil apoptosis. In contrast, neutrophils express the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and levels of this protein correlate with neutrophil survival. Thus, cellular levels of Mcl-1 decline as neutrophils undergo apoptosis and are enhanced by agents (eg, GM-CSF, interleukin-1beta, sodium butyrate, and lipopolysaccharide) that promote neutrophil survival. Neutrophils only possess few, small mitochondria, and much of the Mcl-1 protein seems to be located in nuclear fractions. These observations provide the first evidence implicating a Bcl-2 family member in the regulation of neutrophil survival. Moreover, this work also provides a potential mechanism whereby cytokine-regulated gene expression regulates the functional lifespan of neutrophils and hence their ability to function for extended time periods during acute inflammation.","['Moulding, D A', 'Quayle, J A', 'Hart, C A', 'Edwards, S W']","['Moulding DA', 'Quayle JA', 'Hart CA', 'Edwards SW']","['School of Biological Sciences, Life Sciences Building; and the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74547-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2495-502.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the PDE target for theophylline in CLL remains unknown, we examined the ability of isoform-specific PDE inhibitors to increase cAMP levels and induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of purified CLL cDNA amplified transcripts for PDE1B, 4A and 4B. The type 4 PDE inhibitor rolipram but not the type 1 inhibitor vinpocetine increased CLL cAMP levels. Rolipram-inhibitable (type 4) but not calcium-calmodulin augmented (type 1) PDE enzyme activity was detected in CLL samples. In samples from 13 of 14 CLL patients, rolipram induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion over a 48-hour period. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-cultured whole mononuclear cells (WMC) and anti-Ig stimulated CD19(+) B cells were resistant to the induction of apoptosis by rolipram while unstimulated CD19(+) B cells, which had a high basal apoptotic rate, were more sensitive. Rolipram stimulated elevations in cAMP levels in all four of these cell populations, suggesting that they differed in sensitivity to cAMP-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, incubation with the cell permeable cAMP analog dibutyryl-cAMP induced apoptosis in CLL cells and unstimulated B cells but not in IL-2-cultured WMC or anti-Ig stimulated B cells. These data identify PDE4 as a family of enzymes whose inhibition induces apoptosis in CLL cells.","['Kim, D H', 'Lerner, A']","['Kim DH', 'Lerner A']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '543512OBTC (vinpocetine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrrolidinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rolipram', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74546-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2484-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the proliferative effect of SCF(100 ng/mL), provided as the sole stimulus, on individual CD34(+) cells from five normal donors and five chronic-phase CML patients. Forty-eight percent of isolated single CML CD34(+) cells proliferated after 6 days of culture to a mean of 18 cells, whereas only 8% of normal CD34(+) cells proliferated (mean number of cells generated was 4). SCF, as a single agent, supported the survival and expansion of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) from CML CD34(+)CD38(+) cells and the more primitive CML CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. These CFU-GM colonies were all bcr-abl positive, showing the specificity of SCF stimulation for the leukemic cell population. Coculture of CML and normal CD34(+) cells showed exclusive growth of Ph+ cells, suggesting that growth in SCF alone is not dependent on secretion of cytokines by CML cells. SCF augmentation of beta1-integrin-mediated adhesion of CML CD34(+) cells to fibronectin was not increased when compared with the effect on normal CD34(+) cells, suggesting that the proliferative and adhesive responses resulting from SCF stimulation are uncoupled. The increased proliferation may contribute to the accumulation of leukemic progenitors, which is a feature of CML.","['Moore, S', 'Haylock, D N', 'Levesque, J P', 'McDiarmid, L A', 'Samels, L M', 'To, L B', 'Simmons, P J', 'Hughes, T P']","['Moore S', 'Haylock DN', 'Levesque JP', 'McDiarmid LA', 'Samels LM', 'To LB', 'Simmons PJ', 'Hughes TP']","['Leukemia Research Laboratory, Division of Haematology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, IMVS, Adelaide, SA, Australia. sarah.moore@invs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Female', 'Fibronectins', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74543-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2461-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, analysis has not been reported for hematopoietic cells on the consequences of this activity for c-jun promoter regulation within its distinctive proximal 8-base consensus CRE-like element, an element linked to JNK-mediated increase in c-jun transcription. In the present study, regulation of the proximal c-jun promoter was studied in murine myeloid cells transformed by p210 BCR-ABL. Promoter regulation in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells was compared with regulation of the promoter in nontransformed interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent parental cells. The composition of nuclear AP-1 proteins contained within cells with p210 BCR-ABL, and their binding to the c-jun promoter proximal CRE-like element, was compared with the composition and binding of AP-1 proteins in IL-3-treated parental cells without p210 BCR-ABL. The present analysis found fivefold increased c-jun transcription occurring in p210 BCR-ABL transformed murine myeloid cells possessing a corresponding magnitude of increased kinase activity of JNK, compared with IL-3-stimulated parental cells. Augmented JNK activity was accompanied by increased nuclear abundance of c-jun and c-fos proteins that bound specifically to the proximal c-jun promoter CRE element. Also, representative human leukemic cell lines expressing p210 BCR-ABL and possessing abundant kinase activity of JNK, when compared with parental cells that were deficient in JNK activity, had increased c-jun and c-fos proteins. Finally, to show the relevance of these observations in model systems, we studied blast cells from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemic transformation, and observed comparable activities of JNK catalysis and c-jun/AP-1 protein relative to the cell lines that possessed p210 BCR-ABL and JNK activity.

The common novel structural motiff for almost all the analogs included removal of C-19 (19-nor); each also had unsaturation of the side chain. All the compounds were potent; for example, the concentration of analogs producing a 50% clonal inhibition (ED50) ranged between 1 x 10(-9) to 4 x 10(-11) mol/L when using the HL-60 cell line. The most active compound [1, 25(OH)2-16,23E-diene-26-trifluoro-19-nor-cholecalciferol (Ro 25-9716)] had an ED50 of 4 x 10(-11) mol/L; in contrast, the 1,25D3 produced an ED50 of 10(-9) mol/L with the HL-60 target cells. Ro 25-9716 (10(-9) mol/L, 3 days) was a strong inducer of myeloid differentiation because it caused 92% of the HL-60 cells to express CD11b and 75% of these cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). This compound (10(-8) mol/L, 4 days) also caused HL-60 cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (88% cells in G1 v 48% of the untreated control cells). The p27(kip-1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which is important in blocking the cell cycle, was induced more quickly and potently by Ro 25-9716 (10(-7) mol/L, 0 to 5 days) than by 1,25D3, suggesting a possible mechanism by which these analogs inhibit proliferation of leukemic growth. The NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells cultured with the Ro 25-9716 were also inhibited in their clonal proliferation (ED50, 5 x 10(-11) mol/L) and their expression of CD11b was enhanced (80% positive [10(-9) mol/L, 4 days] v 27% untreated NB4 cells). Moreover, the combination of Ro 25-9716 (10(-9) mol/L) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 10(-7) mol/L) induced 92% of the NB4 cells to reduce NBT, whereas only 26% of the cells became NBT positive after a similar exposure to the combination of 1,25D3 and ATRA. Surprisingly, Ro 25-9716 also inhibited the clonal growth of poorly differentiated leukemia cell lines (RA-res HL-60 [ED50, 4 x 10(-9) mol/L] and Kasumi-1 [ED50, 5 x 10(-10) mol/L]). For HL-60 cells, Ro 25-9716 markedly decreased the percent of the cells in S phase of the cell cycle and increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27(kip-1). In summary, 19-nor vitamin D3 compounds strongly induced differentiation and inhibited clonal proliferation of various myeloid leukemia cell lines, suggesting a therapeutic niche for their use in myeloid leukemia.","['Asou, H', 'Koike, M', 'Elstner, E', 'Cambell, M', 'Le, J', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Kamada, N', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Asou H', 'Koike M', 'Elstner E', 'Cambell M', 'Le J', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Kamada N', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74541-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2441-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, we identified two endogenous inhibitors in this system. One is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which is equally active on primitive normal and CML progenitors. The other we now show to be monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Thus, MCP-1, when added to LTC, blocked the activation of primitive normal progenitors but did not arrest the cycling of primitive CML progenitors. Moreover, the endogenous inhibitory activity of LTC stromal layers could be overcome by the addition of neutralizing antibodies to MCP-1, but not to macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). However, neither of these antibodies antagonized the inhibitory activity of NAc-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) on primitive normal but not CML progenitor cycling in this system. Moreover, none of six other -C-C- or -C-X-C- chemokines, previously shown to inhibit primitive normal human CFC proliferation in semisolid assays, were found to act as negative regulators when added to normal LTC. These results provide further support for the concept that primitive CML progenitor cell proliferation is deregulated when these cells are exposed to limiting concentrations of multiple inhibitors, only some of which have differential actions on normal and Ph+/BCR-ABL+ cells.","['Cashman, J D', 'Eaves, C J', 'Sarris, A H', 'Eaves, A C']","['Cashman JD', 'Eaves CJ', 'Sarris AH', 'Eaves AC']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency and the Departments of Medical Genetics, Medicine, and Pathology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74529-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2338-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To learn more about the problem, we studied a group of children whose leukemia had been in remission for 10 or more years before relapse and tried to determine whether they had true recurrences or second malignancies. We studied children treated on Medical Research Council ALL protocols between 1970 and 1984 and followed up by the Clinical Trial Service Unit in Oxford. Detailed clinical and laboratory data was collected from the centers concerned on all who were reported to have had a recurrence of their leukemia after 10 or more years from the time of achieving first complete remission (CR1). To prove that the relapse was a true recurrence rather than a second or secondary leukemia, DNA extracted from archived marrow smears was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the presence of an identical Ig heavy chain (IgH) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement at initial diagnosis and subsequent relapse. A total of 1,134 of 2,746 children had survived 10 years or more (range, 10 to 24 years) in CR1 and of those, 12 (approximately 1%) had subsequently relapsed. Relapse blast cells were shown to express the common ALL antigen (CD 10) in all cases and an identical clonal IgH or TCR gene rearrangement was found on PCR analysis of DNA from diagnosis and relapse in all eight cases where DNA extraction was successful. A further program of therapy was successful in inducing a second CR in all patients, four of whom have succumbed to a second relapse after 12 to 27 months. The remaining eight are in continuing CR2 at a follow-up of 12 to 108 months (median, 52) from relapse.

The Medical Research Council Adult and Children's Leukaemia Working Parties.",2322-33,"Cytogenetics is considered one of the most valuable prognostic determinants in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, many studies on which this assertion is based were limited by relatively small sample sizes or varying treatment approach, leading to conflicting data regarding the prognostic implications of specific cytogenetic abnormalities. The Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial, which included children and adults up to 55 years of age, not only affords the opportunity to determine the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics in the context of large patient groups receiving comparable therapy, but also to address their impact on the outcome of subsequent transplantation procedures performed in first complete remission (CR). On the basis of response to induction treatment, relapse risk, and overall survival, three prognostic groups could be defined by cytogenetic abnormalities detected at presentation in comparison with the outcome of patients with normal karyotype. AML associated with t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16) predicted a relatively favorable outcome. Whereas in patients lacking these favorable changes, the presence of a complex karyotype, -5, del(5q), -7, or abnormalities of 3q defined a group with relatively poor prognosis. The remaining group of patients including those with 11q23 abnormalities, +8, +21, +22, del(9q), del(7q) or other miscellaneous structural or numerical defects not encompassed by the favorable or adverse risk groups were found to have an intermediate prognosis. The presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities did not modify the outcome of patients with favorable cytogenetics. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the three cytogenetically defined prognostic groups retained their predictive value in the context of secondary as well as de novo AML, within the pediatric age group and furthermore were found to be a key determinant of outcome from autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first CR. This study highlights the importance of diagnostic cytogenetics as an independent prognostic factor in AML, providing the framework for a stratified treatment approach of this disease, which has been adopted in the current MRC AML 12 trial.","['Grimwade, D', 'Walker, H', 'Oliver, F', 'Wheatley, K', 'Harrison, C', 'Harrison, G', 'Rees, J', 'Hann, I', 'Stevens, R', 'Burnett, A', 'Goldstone, A']","['Grimwade D', 'Walker H', 'Oliver F', 'Wheatley K', 'Harrison C', 'Harrison G', 'Rees J', 'Hann I', 'Stevens R', 'Burnett A', 'Goldstone A']","[""Departments of Haematology, University College London; the Royal Free and Great Ormond St Children's Hospitals, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Aneuploidy', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/ultrastructure', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/classification/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74527-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2322-33.,,,['Blood. 2000 Sep 1;96(5):2002.

The normal range for 500 interphase nuclei was </=4 (</=0.8%) nuclei based on 10 bone marrow and 10 blood specimens from normal individuals. The percentage of neoplastic nuclei was usually lower in blood than bone marrow. However, changes in the percentage of neoplastic nuclei in blood and bone marrow tracked closely over the course of therapy and with the results of quantitative cytogenetic studies on bone marrow. This result indicates that D-FISH is useful to test blood from patients with CML to monitor therapy. Moreover, by analysis of 6,000 nuclei with D-FISH, residual disease was identified in bone marrow and blood for patients in complete cytogenetic remission. Consequently, D-FISH analyses of interphase nuclei from blood could substitute for Q-cytogenetic studies on bone marrow. Thus, it may not be necessary to collect bone marrow samples so frequently to monitor therapy in CML.","['Buno, I', 'Wyatt, W A', 'Zinsmeister, A R', 'Dietz-Band, J', 'Silver, R T', 'Dewald, G W']","['Buno I', 'Wyatt WA', 'Zinsmeister AR', 'Dietz-Band J', 'Silver RT', 'Dewald GW']","['Division of Laboratory Genetics and Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'Blood Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Organ Specificity', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74526-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2315-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On day 5 patients not responding or progressing on low-dose 6MPred could be switched to high-dose 6MPred. All patients, aged 1 to 55 years, were recipients of unmanipulated BMT from HLA identical sibling donors. Patients were stratified at randomization for age (</>/= 20 years), disease (acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], nonneoplastic disease), disease status (early/advanced), and GvHD prophylaxis (cyclosporin/cyclosporin + methotrexate). Primary endpoints were response to treatment and evolution of aGvHD to grade III-IV. Secondary endpoints were cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and relapse. The median interval between BMT and treatment was 12 days (6 to 43). Results in the two groups (2 v 10 mg/kg) were as follows: response of aGvHD 68% versus 71% (P = .9), evolution to aGvHD grade III-IV 17% versus 20% (P = . 6), CMV infections 55% versus 60% (P = .7), 3-year actuarial TRM 28% versus 32% (P = .7), relapse 17% versus 7% (P = .1). The actuarial survival at 3 years was 63% versus 62% (P = .9) with a median follow up of 580 and 778 days. On day 5 of therapy, 26 patients assigned to low-dose (2 mg/kg) 6MPred were switched to a higher dose of 6MPred because of no response or progression. Their actuarial TRM was 46%, which is significantly higher than TRM of patients who responded on 2 mg/kg and continued with tapering doses (TRM = 16%, P = .007). In conclusion, early treatment of acute GvHD with 6MPred 10 mg/kg/d does not improve the response rate as compared with 2 mg/kg/d, nor does it prevent evolution to aGvHD grade III-IV. CMV infections, TRM, and survival were also comparable. A group of patients at high risk of TRM can be identified after 5 days of treatment with 6MPred 2 mg/kg and could be eligible for alternative forms of therapy.","['Van Lint, M T', 'Uderzo, C', 'Locasciulli, A', 'Majolino, I', 'Scime, R', 'Locatelli, F', 'Giorgiani, G', 'Arcese, W', 'Iori, A P', 'Falda, M', 'Bosi, A', 'Miniero, R', 'Alessandrino, P', 'Dini, G', 'Rotoli, B', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Van Lint MT', 'Uderzo C', 'Locasciulli A', 'Majolino I', 'Scime R', 'Locatelli F', 'Giorgiani G', 'Arcese W', 'Iori AP', 'Falda M', 'Bosi A', 'Miniero R', 'Alessandrino P', 'Dini G', 'Rotoli B', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Divisione Ematologial, Ospedale San Martino, Genova; Clinica Pediatrica, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/chemically induced', 'Hypertension/chemically induced', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74523-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2288-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the scarce Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells in involved tissue synthesize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and costimulatory molecules such as CD40 or CD86, it is unclear whether these tumor cells are operational antigen-presenting cells (APC). We developed an immunofluorescence-based assay to determine the number of MHC class II molecules present on the surface of single living HRS cells. We found that in fresh Hodgkin's disease lymph node biopsies, a subset of HRS cells express a substantial number of surface MHC class II molecules that are occupied by MHC class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP), indicating deficient loading of MHC class II molecules with antigenic peptides. Cultured Hodgkin's disease-derived (HD) cell lines, however, were found to express few MHC class II molecules carrying CLIP peptides on the cell surface and were shown to generate sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-stable MHC class II alphabeta dimers. In addition to showing deficient MHC class II antigen presentation in a subset of HRS cells, our results show that the widely used HD-cell lines are not ideal in vitro models for the disease. The disruption of MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation in HRS cells could represent a key mechanism by which these tumor cells escape immune surveillance.","['Bosshart, H', 'Jarrett, R F']","['Bosshart H', 'Jarrett RF']","['Leukemia Research Fund Virus Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-D Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74519-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2252-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA treatment induces downregulation of PML/RARalpha and reorganization of the PML-nuclear bodies. These events have been proposed to be essential for the induction of APL cell differentiation by RA. Here, we show that in the APL-derived NB4 cell line as well as in myeloid precursor U937 cells expressing the PML/RARalpha (U937/PR9) and in blasts from APL patients, the PML/RARalpha fusion protein is cleaved by a caspase 3-like activity induced by RA treatment. In fact, a caspase 3-like activity is detectable in PML/RARalpha expressing cells after RA treatment, and selective caspase inhibitor peptides are able to prevent the RA-induced degradation of the fusion protein in vivo and in vitro. Using recombinant caspases and PML/RARalpha deletion mutants we mapped a caspase 3 cleavage site (Asp 522) within the alpha-helix region of the PML component of the fusion protein. The extent of PML/RARalpha cleavage directly correlates with the ability of RA to restore the normal PML nuclear bodies (NBs) pattern. However, RA-induced differentiation is not prevented by the persistence of the fusion product and occurs in the absence of normally structured PML NBs. These results indicate that PML/RARalpha is directly involved in conferring RA sensitivity of APL cells and that the RA-induced reassembly of PML NBs is the consequence of the disappearance of PML/RARalpha.","['Nervi, C', 'Ferrara, F F', 'Fanelli, M', 'Rippo, M R', 'Tomassini, B', 'Ferrucci, P F', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Gelmetti, V', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Diverio, D', 'Grignani, F', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Testi, R']","['Nervi C', 'Ferrara FF', 'Fanelli M', 'Rippo MR', 'Tomassini B', 'Ferrucci PF', 'Ruthardt M', 'Gelmetti V', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Diverio D', 'Grignani F', 'Pelicci PG', 'Testi R']","['Dipartimento di Istologia ed Embriologia Medica and Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari e Ematologia, University of Rome ""La Sapienza,"" Rome. nervi@axrma.uniromal.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74518-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2244-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA-PK is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase that functions in DNA double-strand break repair and in the joining process in recombination mechanisms. In a series of 34 patients with B-CLL, either untreated (n = 16) or resistant to chlorambucil (n = 18), the kinase activity of the complex, as determined by its capacity to phosphorylate a peptide substrate in vitro, is increased in the resistant samples as compared with the untreated ones (24.4 +/- 2.6 arbitrary units [a.u.] [range, 12.7 to 55.8 a.u.] versus 8.1 +/- 2.8 a.u. [range, 0.9 to 44.5 a.u.], respectively (P < .0001]), independent of other clinical and biological factors. Linear regression analysis shows an excellent correlation between the level of DNA-PK activity and the inherent in vitro sensitivity of CLL lymphocytes to chlorambucil (r = .875, P =.0001). The regulation of DNA-PK activity was associated with increased DNA-binding activity of its regulatory subunit, the Ku heterodimer, in resistant samples. These results suggest that this activity is a determinant in the cellular response to chlorambucil and participates in the development of nitrogen mustard-resistant disease. The increase in DNA-PK activity might contribute to the enhanced cross-link repair that we previously postulated to be a primary mechanism of resistance to nitrogen mustards in CLL.","['Muller, C', 'Christodoulopoulos, G', 'Salles, B', 'Panasci, L']","['Muller C', 'Christodoulopoulos G', 'Salles B', 'Panasci L']","['Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale (CNRS UPR 9062), Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/09/25 00:00,1998/09/25 00:01,['1998/09/25 00:00'],"['1998/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74514-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Oct 1;92(7):2213-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MEL-cells rendered deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) activity by stable transfection with DNA encoding for either a mutant regulatory subunit or a specific peptide inhibitor of A-Kinase (PKI) are unable to differentiate normally in response to chemical inducers. We have identified by 2-D Western blotting 2 phosphorylated forms of p19, a highly conserved 18-19 kDa cytosolic protein that is frequently upregulated in transformed cells and undergoes phosphorylation in mammalian cells upon activation of several signal transduction pathways. The phosphorylation of the more acidic phosphorylated form is increased in a cAMP-dependent fashion and impaired in cells deficient in cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). Treatment of MEL-cells with the chemical inducer of differentiation hexamethylene-bisacetamide (HMBA) led to dephosphoryation of this phosphoform. Our data are compatible with previous observations which imply that phosphorylation of Ser 38 in p19 by p34cdc2-kinase leads to a more basic phosphoform and simultaneous phosphorylation by mitogen-activated kinase of Ser 25 in response to protein kinase C and the cAMP-dependent kinase creates the more acidic species.","['Scheele, J S']",['Scheele JS'],"['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)', '126195-39-9 (Stmn1 protein, rat)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/deficiency', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/drug effects', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Stathmin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/24 00:00,1998/09/24 00:01,['1998/09/24 00:00'],"['1998/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1016563720515 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1998 Aug;185(1-2):55-63. doi: 10.1023/a:1016563720515.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complete remission rates after conventional induction chemotherapy progressively decreases after the age of 60. This is explained by host-related factors and by differences in the biology of leukemia. The incidence of adverse prognostic factors (trilineage myelodysplasia, unfavorable karyotype, mdrl-positive phenotype) is higher in elderly patients. Three strategies are currently offered to older adults with acute myeloid leukemia: intensive chemotherapy, palliative treatment and attenuated dose chemotherapy. Currently, complete remission rates achieved with conventional chemotherapy range from 40-65% according to inclusion criteria. In the past few years, two approaches have been tested in order to improve the results of induction chemotherapy: modifications of chemotherapy regimens with new intercalating agents (idarubicin, mitoxantrone) and the use of myeloid growth factors. Myeloid growth factors have been administered with two objectives: to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the toxic death rate when given after induction chemotherapy, and to prime leukemic blasts when given during chemotherapy. The results of published placebo-controlled studies are discussed. The issues of palliative treatment and of attenuated dose chemotherapy are also addressed in the review, with special emphasis on the role of oral idarubicin.","['Harousseau, J L']",['Harousseau JL'],"['Department of Haematology, Hotel Dieu, NANTES, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",1998/09/24 00:00,1998/09/24 00:01,['1998/09/24 00:00'],"['1998/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(98)90012-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(98)90012-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1998 Sep;12(3):145-53. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(98)90012-1.,,,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To analyze clonality and residual disease in myeloid leukemia retrospectively, we applied FISH to bone marrow smears stored at ambient temperature for up to 9 years. RESULTS: When hybridization efficiency was investigated on stored control smears from patients without hematological malignancy, more than 96% of nuclei showed the expected number of signals using DNA probes specific for chromosome 7, X or Y. In combination with cell morphology, we observed much higher hybridization efficiency in blasts and granulomonocytic cells compared with lymphoid and erythroid cells. On the basis of good hybridization efficiency for old smear specimens, we applied FISH to stored bone marrow smears of myeloid leukemias, in which either loss of chromosome 7 or loss of sex chromosomes had been verified previously by conventional cytogenetics (one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and four with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; three M2 and one M7)). As a result, the loss of chromosome was detected in blasts from all patients and was observed in mature granulocytes, except in M7. In the CMML patient and one AML (M2) patient with t(8;21), lymphoid and erythroid cells also showed the loss of chromosomes, suggesting that it should occur at stem-cell level. A high amount of residual disease was detected in the morphological remission samples in one AML (M2) patient after induction therapy. The patient eventually succumbed to relapse. CONCLUSION: Thus, the present FISH technique is useful to analyze the clinical significance of clonality and the residual disease in myeloid leukemia, retrospectively.","['Hyakuna, N', 'Naritomi, K', 'Ito, E']","['Hyakuna N', 'Naritomi K', 'Ito E']","['First Department of Pathology, University of the Ryukyus, School of Medicine, Okinawa, Japan. hyakunan@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Preservation, Biological', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1998/09/24 00:00,1998/09/24 00:01,['1998/09/24 00:00'],"['1998/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1998.tb01939.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1998 Aug;40(4):318-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1998.tb01939.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic resistance and susceptibility to persistent lymphocytosis (PL), an advanced subclinical stage of infection characterized by a polyclonal expansion of the infected B cell population, have been mapped to structural motifs in bovine MHC DRB3 (class II) alleles. To determine whether alleles of DRB3 influence the number of BLV-infected B cells in peripheral blood, seven pairs of Holstein cows naturally infected with BLV were matched on the basis of DRB3 genotype (resistance or susceptibility to PL), age, and year of seroconversion. Flow cytometry was used to separate B cell populations that then were tested for the presence of provirus by a single-cell PCR methodology. Animals with the PL-resistance associated DRB3.2*11 allele had significantly fewer BLV-infected B cells than did age- and seroconversion-matched cows with DRB3 alleles associated with susceptibility to PL. Our results demonstrate that DRB3 or a closely linked gene may play a direct role in controlling the number of BLV-infected peripheral B cells in vivo. Association of MHC class II alleles with resistance to disease progression in cattle naturally infected with BLV provides a unique immunogenetic model for the study of host resistance to human and other animal retroviral infections.","['Mirsky, M L', 'Olmstead, C', 'Da, Y', 'Lewin, H A']","['Mirsky ML', 'Olmstead C', 'Da Y', 'Lewin HA']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 61801, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Anim Genet,Animal genetics,8605704,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Aging/immunology', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cell Separation/veterinary', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Monocytes/virology', '*Viral Load']",1998/09/24 00:00,1998/09/24 00:01,['1998/09/24 00:00'],"['1998/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2052.1998.00320.x [doi]'],ppublish,Anim Genet. 1998 Aug;29(4):245-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2052.1998.00320.x.,,['R01CA59148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We measured lower leg length and markers of bone formation [bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide (PICP)], bone resorption [pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline, and carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP)], soft tissue turnover [procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide (P3NP)], and the GH axis [IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), IGFBP-2, and urinary GH] at 1- to 4-week intervals from diagnosis to week 27 of treatment. In addition, GH-binding protein was measured at diagnosis. At diagnosis, mean SD scores were: bone ALP, -1.84; PICP -1.77; pyridinoline, -1.42; deoxypyridinoline, -1.66; ICTP, -0.42; P3NP, +1.45; GH, +24.4; IGF-I, -1.70; IGFBP-3, -0.88; IGFBP-2, +2.42; and GH-binding protein, -0.69. Bone ALP, PICP, and IGFBP-3 were all correlated (P < or = 0.03). During induction and intensification, there was shrinkage of the lower leg, with decreases in PICP, pyridinoline, ICTP, and P3NP (P < 0.05), whereas IGF-I and IGFBP-3 increased (P < 0.05). After prednisolone was discontinued, bone ALP and collagen markers increased markedly (P < 0.01), but there was no significant change in IGF-I and IGFBP-3. In 12 children who received high dose i.v. methotrexate, postglucocorticoid increases in bone ALP and PICP were less, whereas those in ICTP and P3NP were greater, compared to levels in children who did not receive methotrexate (P < 0.05). We conclude that ALL itself caused GH resistance and low bone turnover. During early intensive chemotherapy, further suppression of osteoblast proliferation and osteoclast activity occurred, not mediated through the systemic GH axis, probably by the direct action of prednisolone on bone. The postglucocorticoid increase in bone turnover was also independent of the GH axis and was modulated by high dose i.v. methotrexate, which depressed osteoblast recovery and enhanced osteoclast activity.","['Crofton, P M', 'Ahmed, S F', 'Wade, J C', 'Stephen, R', 'Elmlinger, M W', 'Ranke, M B', 'Kelnar, C J', 'Wallace, W H']","['Crofton PM', 'Ahmed SF', 'Wade JC', 'Stephen R', 'Elmlinger MW', 'Ranke MB', 'Kelnar CJ', 'Wallace WH']","['Department of Pediatric Biochemistry, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide)', '0 (procollagen Type III-N-terminal peptide)', '0 (procollagen type I carboxy terminal peptide)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Bone Remodeling', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen/blood/*metabolism', 'Collagen Type I', 'Human Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Peptides/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Procollagen/blood', 'Prospective Studies']",1998/09/24 00:00,1998/09/24 00:01,['1998/09/24 00:00'],"['1998/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.83.9.5133 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1998 Sep;83(9):3121-9. doi: 10.1210/jcem.83.9.5133.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, selective Na+ influx is accomplished through GTP-activated Na+ channels, the best characterized of which are found in renal epithelia. We have described recently a GTP-dependent Na+ current in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells that differs from previous reported Na+ channels in several ways including selectivity, pharmacology and mechanism of activation. In this report, we have investigated the biophysical properties of the RBL cell Na+ current using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Following activation by 250-500 microM GTP gamma S, hyperpolarizing steps to a fixed potential (-100 mV) from a holding potential of 0 mV evoked transient inward Na+ currents that declined during the pulse. If the holding potential was made more positive (range 0 to +100 mV), then the amplitude of the transient inward current evoked by the hyperpolarization increased steeply, demonstrating that the conductance of the channels was voltage-dependent. Using a paired pulse protocol (500 msec pulses to -100 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV), it was found that the peak amplitude of the current during the second pulse became larger as the interpulse potential became more positive. In addition, increasing the time at which the cells were held at positive potentials also resulted in larger currents, indicating a time-dependent conductance change. With symmetrical Na+ solutions, outward currents were recorded at positive potentials and these demonstrated both a time- and voltage-dependent increase in conductance. The results show that a nonvoltage activated Na+ channel in an electrically nonexcitable cell undergoes prominent voltage-dependent transitions. Possible mechanisms underlying this voltage dependency are discussed.","['Parekh, A B']",['Parekh AB'],"['Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Sodium Channels)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophysiology', 'Ion Channel Gating/physiology', 'Ion Transport/physiology', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Sodium Channels/*physiology']",1998/09/24 00:00,1998/09/24 00:01,['1998/09/24 00:00'],"['1998/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002329900428 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1998 Sep 15;165(2):145-51. doi: 10.1007/s002329900428.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of the COOH-terminal residues of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain has been shown to abolish its cell adhesive activity, which has been ascribed to the failure of the deletion mutants to associate with catenins. Based on our present results, this concept needs revision. As was reported previously, leukemia cells (K562) expressing E-cadherin with COOH-terminal deletion of 37 or 71 amino acid residues showed almost no aggregation. Cells expressing E-cadherin with further deletion of 144 or 151 amino acid residues, which eliminates the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain, showed E-cadherin-dependent aggregation. Thus, deletion of the membrane-proximal region results in activation of the nonfunctional E-cadherin polypeptides. However, these cells did not show compaction. Chemical cross-linking revealed that the activated E-cadherin polypeptides can be cross-linked to a dimer on the surface of cells, whereas the inactive polypeptides, as well as the wild-type E-cadherin polypeptide containing the membrane-proximal region, can not. Therefore, the membrane-proximal region participates in regulation of the adhesive activity by preventing lateral dimerization of the extracellular domain.","['Ozawa, M', 'Kemler, R']","['Ozawa M', 'Kemler R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan. mozawa@med2.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Catenins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (delta catenin)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cadherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Catenins', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.142.6.1605 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1998 Sep 21;142(6):1605-13. doi: 10.1083/jcb.142.6.1605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2141769,,,,

In the present study, we evaluated the QAA as inhibitors of cell growth and studied their mechanism of action. METHODS: We compared the effects of the QAA on the proliferation of human leukemia cell lines which are sensitive (HL-60) or resistant to ET-18-OCH3 (HL-60R and K562). In addition we used cell fractionation and enzymatic assays to determine the effects of QAA on protein kinase C (PKC) translocation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). RESULTS: The QAA and ET-18-OCH3 were approximately equally effective inhibitors of HL-60 cell growth. However, the QAA were more effective inhibitors of K562 and HL-60R cell proliferation. The HL-60R cells, which were selected for resistance to ET-18-OCH3, were also resistant to BM 41.440 which is structurally similar. In serum-free medium, the phosphorus-containing compounds (ET-18-OCH3, BM 41.440 and He-PC) were much more effective inhibitors (8-20-fold) of the K562 cell line while the activities of the QAA were only moderately increased (1.2-2.3-fold). When serum albumin was added to the serum-free medium, the K562 cells became resistant to ET-18-OCH3, suggesting that albumin is responsible for the differential sensitivity. The QAA compounds, which inhibit PKC activity in vitro, inhibited cell proliferation. However, a QAA which did not inhibit PKC did not inhibit cell proliferation. The phorbol ester TPA stimulates PKC translocation and causes HL-60 cell differentiation to adherent macrophage-type cells. The QAA inhibited TPA-induced cell differentiation and PKC translocation indicating that they also inhibit PKC in intact cells. CONCLUSIONS: The cellular effects of the QAA appear to be due to inhibition of PKC. In addition, these data indicate that albumin, which is important as a mediator of the uptake of ET-18-OCH3, has only a small effect on the uptake of QAA. Together these data indicate that the QAA are potential anticancer agents, showing a significant ability to inhibit growth of leukemia cell lines that are resistant to ET-18-OCH3.","['Civoli, F', 'Daniel, L W']","['Civoli F', 'Daniel LW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '113201-37-9 (SRI 62-834)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', '5ZZK34MC3V (ilmofosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylcholine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050824 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;42(4):319-26. doi: 10.1007/s002800050824.,,"['CA12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a multicenter study we investigated whether thioguanine (6TG), which is converted more directly to the cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGN), offers a therapeutic advantage over 6MP. In this study (COALL-92), 6TG was randomized versus 6MP in maintenance therapy, whereby the doses of both drugs had to be adjusted to a white blood cell (WBC) count of between 2 and 3/nl. In 19 children the plasma levels of both drugs and/or the accumulation of their metabolites in red blood cells (RBC) were measured during intensive treatment in two consecutive chemotherapy blocks, and in 54 children the metabolites in RBC were measured every 3 months during daily treatment in maintenance therapy. There was a marked interindividual difference in the plasma kinetics of the two drugs; after identical doses of 100 mg/m2 an about 4-fold higher peak concentration of the parent drug was reached with 6MP. The main metabolites of 6TG were thioguanine nucleotides (TGN), whereas during 6MP treatment, methylated thioinosine nucleotides (TIN) predominated in erythrocytes. In patients receiving 6TG during maintenance therapy (22 patients) the concentration of methylated TGN reached about 40% of that of unmethylated TGN; after 6MP administration (32 patients) the methylated TIN were concentrated about 26-fold higher in RBC than were TGN. In contrast to 6TG, for 6MP the pattern of metabolites shifted toward the methylated ones with increasing dose. The median TGN concentration was about 7-fold higher in the TG branch, although the median dose was only about 70% of that of 6MP. The WBC values were equivalent in the two treatment groups. Our results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of 6MP is not based solely on the formation of TGN.","['Erb, N', 'Harms, D O', 'Janka-Schaub, G']","['Erb N', 'Harms DO', 'Janka-Schaub G']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Hamburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thioinosine/blood', 'Thionucleotides/blood']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050816 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;42(4):266-72. doi: 10.1007/s002800050816.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of calcium-calmodulin-dependent enzymes sensitize resistant tumor cells to the topo II poison etoposide (VP-16) by enhancing DNA damage and an apoptotic response. In the present study, we have investigated the consequences of buffering intracellular calcium with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxy-methyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) on the sensitizing effects of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1-[N,O-bis(1,5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-piperazine (KN-62) in etoposide-resistant human leukemia HL-60 (HL-60/ADR0.05) cells. In cells pretreated with 20 microM BAPTA-AM for 2 hr, extracellular ATP failed to trigger intracellular calcium transients, and no effects on the accumulation of VP-16 were apparent. Also, the effect of KN-62 in significantly (P=0.002 to 0.042) enhancing the accumulation of VP-16 in HL-60/ADR0.05 cells was unaffected due to pretreatment with BAPTA-AM. In contrast, pretreatment with BAPTA-AM reduced the DNA damage induced by VP-16, and significantly (P=0.038) reversed the enhancement by KN-62 of VP-16-stabilized topo II-mediated DNA cleavable complex formation. The pretreatment of HL-60/ADR0.05 cells with BAPTA-AM was also associated with the hypophosphorylation of topo IIalpha. Consistent with the ability of BAPTA-AM to circumvent the potentiation by KN-62 of VP-16-induced DNA damage, survival of cells treated with 40 microM VP-16 in the absence of KN-62 and 10 microM VP-16 in the presence of KN-62 was significantly (P=0.026 to 0.031) higher due to BAPTA-AM pretreatment.

The present study was performed using a spectrofluorometric method with which it is possible to follow continuously the uptake and release of fluorescent molecules by living cells, as the incubation of the cells with the drug proceeds. Erythroleukemia K562 cell lines were used. It has been shown that the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of these three anthracyclines can be inhibited by vinca alkaloids derivatives. At pH 7.2, 50% of the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of daunorubicin and idarubicin was inhibited by about 40 +/- 10 microM vinblastine and that of pirarubicin by 10 +/- 2 microM vinblastine. The vinblastine concentration required to inhibit 50% of the active efflux of these anthracyclines did not depend on the anthracycline concentrations used, indicating that the inhibition was non competitive. The ability of navelbine, vincristine and vindesine to inhibit the active efflux of pirarubicin was also checked; 15 +/- 3 microM navelbine are required to inhibit 50% of the active efflux but at concentrations lower than 100 microM, neither vincristine nor vindesine were able to inhibit this efflux, indicating that the vinca alkaloids compounds which are the most efficient are the most lipophilic. For the four vinca alkaloids, the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the efflux was lower as the pH was higher. A detailed kinetics analysis of the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of pirarubicin in the presence of vinblastine indicates a non competitive inhibition with K(I) = 12 +/- 2 microM.","['Pereira, E', 'Tarasiuk, J', 'Garnier-Suillerot, A']","['Pereira E', 'Tarasiuk J', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie Biomoleculaire et Cellulaire (UPRES-A 7033), Universite Paris-Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Idarubicin/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'Vindesine/pharmacology', 'Vinorelbine']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(98)00036-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(98)00036-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1998 Jul 3;114(1-2):61-76. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(98)00036-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether lesions of this gene also occur in leukaemia, we have analysed a total of 97 patients (chronic myeloid leukaemia, CML, in chronic phase or blast crisis, n = 71; de novo acute leukaemia, n = 26) and 16 normal individuals. Intact FHIT transcripts from all cases were amplified using RT-PCR. In addition, smaller size bands that were less intense than the full-length products were amplified from several samples from patients with leukaemia and also from normal leucocytes. Sequencing of the small products revealed that they were derived from FHIT transcripts lacking whole exons. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, no mutations in the coding sequence were detected in any patient. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity was not seen in any of 36 informative patients at D3S1300 or D3S1481, markers located within the FHIT locus. We conclude that the FHIT gene and other uncharacterized tumour-suppressor genes at 3p14.2 are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of acute leukaemia or progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis. Moreover, low-abundance FHIT transcripts that lack whole exons are not specific to malignant cells and should not be taken as evidence of an abnormality in the absence of demonstrable genomic DNA lesions.","['Carapeti, M', 'Aguiar, R C', 'Sill, H', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Carapeti M', 'Aguiar RC', 'Sill H', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proteins/*genetics']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.547 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Sep;78(5):601-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.547.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2063063,,,,

Pgp may also be present in normal tissue, providing protection against toxic substances, but the physiological role of Pgp is not fully understood. Recently, it was shown that Pgp also takes part in the transport of certain growth-regulating cytokines (Drach et al, 1996; Raghu et al, 1996). Therefore, we studied the effect of the highly potent Pgp inhibitor PSC 833 on proliferation of three pairs of MDR and parental human cell lines (HB8065 hepatoma cells, KG1a and K562 leukaemia cells). The MDR phenotypes were characterized by Pgp overexpression, which was demonstrated by flow cytometry using the anti-Pgp antibody MRK16. Electronic cell counting of 72-96 h cultures revealed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect of PSC 833 in the resistant KG1a/200 and K562/150 cells. The half-maximal growth inhibitory concentrations (GI50) were 0.2 microM and 0.7 microM respectively. Exposure to PSC 833 induced cell death by apoptosis in both cell types, as revealed by flow cytometry and detection of 3'-hydroxy ends of DNA (the result of DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis), by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labelling (TUNEL). Similar effects were not found in the hepatoma cell lines or the parental leukaemia lines. These results demonstrated a discriminating cytotoxicity of PSC 833 in two human leukaemia MDR variants, representing a possible therapeutic indication which warrants consideration during the ongoing clinical evaluation of this drug.","['Lehne, G', 'Rugstad, H E']","['Lehne G', 'Rugstad HE']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, The National Hospital, Rikshospitalet, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclosporins/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.546 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Sep;78(5):593-600. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.546.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC2063045,,,,

To compare the metabolic effects induced by the anticancer drugs, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (MMPR), which may inhibit the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides or be mis-incorporated into DNA or RNA. METHODS: Leukaemia cells were grown in culture, exposed to a thiopurine and cell extracts were analyzed for NTPs, dNTPs, drug metabolites and P-Rib-PP. RESULTS: In leukaemia cells, 6-MP was converted to MPR-MP, thio-XMP, thio-GMP, thio-GDP and thio-GTP. Metabolites of 6-TG included thio-XMP, thio-GMP, thio-GDP and thio-GTP, while MMPR-MP was the only major metabolite of MMPR, MMPR (25 microM, 4 h) induced a 16-fold increase in P-Rib-PP and 6-MP (25 microM, 4 h) induced a delayed 5.2-fold increase. MPR-MP, thio-GMP and MMPR-MP are inhibitors of amido phosphoribosyltransferase from leukaemia cells with Ki values of 114 +/- 7.10 microM, 6.20 +/- 2.10 microM and 3.09 +/- 0.30 microM, respectively. CONCLUSION: The nucleoside-5'-monophosphate derivatives of the 3 thiopurines inhibit amido phosphoribosyltransferase in growing leukaemia cells but there is also an initial inhibition of the further conversion of IMP in the pathway. In growing cells, MMPR acts solely as an inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis while 6-TG and to a lesser extent, 6-MP, are converted to significant concentrations of di- and tri-phosphate derivatives which may have other mechanisms of cytotoxicity.","['Shi, R Z', 'Lyons, S D', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Shi RZ', 'Lyons SD', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Purines)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.4.2.14 (Amidophosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amidophosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(98)00053-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00053-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1998 Aug;30(8):885-95. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00053-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All children had an indwelling catheter. The most distinctive result of this investigation is that plasminogen shows a deeper and longer lasting decrease in the [CYC]/MTX/ASP-combination (median 65% NHP) compared to the HIDAC/ASP-combination (median 105% NHP) (p = 0.01). The other parameters showed the characteristic changes after ASP-therapy. None of our patients developed any clinical signs of thrombosis, even though two patients showed four altered coagulation parameters on the same day. This shows, that the coexistence of indwelling catheters plus four decreased coagulation parameters does not necessarily imply the development of thrombosis.

The majority of infections in the neutropenic patient present as fever of unknown origin without recovering a pathogen from the blood stream. The careful evaluation of bacteremic episodes is essential, since knowledge of the bacterial spectrum expected is crucial for the successful anti-infective treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1985 to 1995 all bacteremic episodes in pediatric oncology patients at the University Children's Hospital Freiburg were retrospectively analyzed with respect to the pathogens encountered, the antibiotic susceptibility profile and the underlying conditions. RESULTS: Overall, 113 bacteremic episodes were encountered in pediatric oncology patients, 68 of them in patients with hematological malignancies, and 45 in patients with solid tumors. In both patient groups, gram-positive bacteria were predominant with 72% and 58%, respectively. In patients with hematological malignancies, viridans streptococci were the most frequently isolated pathogens (35%) with a relevant morbidity (29% of patients developed a severe sepsis syndrome and/or ARDS), but were found only in 9% of patients with solid tumors. In 28% of patients with leukemia or lymphoma, gram-negative rods were cultured, in 6% Pseudomonas spec., in 4% Acinetobacter spec., and in 18% enterobacteria. In patients with solid tumors, in 38% gram-negative rods were isolated, 7% Pseudomonas spec., 16% Acinetobacter spec., 16% enterobacteria. In 3 patients, fungemia was observed. The antibiotic susceptibility profile was quite favorable in both, gram-positive and -negative bacteria: none of the gram-positive isolates was resistant to vancomycin, none of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates was resistant to oxacillin. All gram-negative bacteria were fully susceptible to ceftazidime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria account for 2/3 of all bacteremic episodes in pediatric oncology patients. Streptococcus viridans was the most important pathogen in hematological malignancies accounting for a significant, pathogen-specific morbidity.","['Berner, R', 'Sauter, S', 'Duffner, U', 'Brandis, M', 'Niemeyer, C M']","['Berner R', 'Sauter S', 'Duffner U', 'Brandis M', 'Niemeyer CM']",['Universitats-Kinderklinik Freiburg.'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/microbiology/mortality', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/microbiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/microbiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neoplasms/*microbiology/mortality', 'Neutropenia/*microbiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Streptococcal Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology/mortality', 'Survival Rate']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043888 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1998 Jul-Aug;210(4):256-60. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043888.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bakteriamie-Episoden bei padiatrisch-onkologischen Patienten, insbesondere durch Streptokokken der Viridans-Gruppe.",,,,,,,

In our retrospective analysis we tried to estimate prognosis after relapse in children treated with intensive relapse regimens and studied the impact of prognostic factors for second remission and survival. PATIENTS: 102 patients suffering from first relapse were treated intensively according to the relapse protocols BFM REZ91 and REZ93 or intensive salvage therapy consisting of double induction with high dose Ara-C, mitoxantrone and VP-16. Once in CR, patients continued to receive a 6-week consolidation and either allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). RESULTS: Time to relapse was in median 1.1 years, range 0-8 years. Fifty-two of 102 pts. (51%) achieved 2nd remission (CR), 10 (10%) partial remission, 37 (36%) were nonresponders, and 3(3%) died early during salvage therapy. Twenty-seven were still in CR, median 2.5 years, range 0.4-7.0 years, with an overall survival of 21%, SE 5% after 5 years. The response and survival rate was similar in all treatment groups. Fifty patients were transplanted, 43 being in 2nd CR, and 7 with residual blasts. Twenty-seven patients received an allograft: Twenty-one from a matched sibling (MSD), 1 from a haploid and 5 from a matched unrelated donor (MUD); 23 received an autograft. None of the patients transplanted in partial remission survived. Whereas 7 of 16 patients were alive after MSD in 2nd CR, 1 after haploid BMT. Four of 5 patients died after MUD BMT. Multivariate risk factor analysis revealed duration until relapse to be the most important factor for survival after relapse. The maximum risk-ratio was obtained at a threshold value of 1.5 years after diagnosis resulting in a 5-year survival of 10%, SE 5% for early relapse, and 40%, SE 10% for late relapse, p logrank 0.0001. CONCLUSION: Intensive relapse regimens can induce a 2nd CR in half of the patients.

Ten patients had received preventive cranial radiotherapy during front-line treatment, previously. In this group, the cumulative radiation dose ranged between 30 and 39 Gy. Patients received 12 to 30 intrathecal methotrexate doses (median 22). Compared with normative levels for age (100 points) performance IQ (89.9) and full scale IQ (92.0), Culture Fair IQ (88.3) and attention and concentration (90.9) were significantly impaired. Verbal IQ (95.5) was not significantly different from normal expectations. Neurological investigations of 16 patients showed mild signs in 7 (44%) of them, mostly of fine-motor skills and coordination, but no major motor disability. In MRI and CT, white matter changes or ventricular enlargement were noted in 10 of 16 patients (63%). Parent-completed questionnaires indicated problem behaviors in 5 children. Cumulative doses of methotrexate correlated significantly with neuropsychological test results. Children irradiated twice as well as girls had poorer cognitive functions, not being statistically significant. Despite pathological test results, all children attended a normal school and did not exhibit obvious impairment in daily life. In conclusion, CNS relapse and attendant therapy, mostly consisting of a second course of cranial radiotherapy, caused measurable intellectual deficits and CNS morbidity, which did not result in severely impaired performance. Periodic psychological und clinical examinations are recommended for recognition of delayed morbiditiy and early intervention.","['Steinberg, S', 'Hartmann, R', 'Wisniewski, S', 'Berger, K', 'Beck, J D', 'Henze, G']","['Steinberg S', 'Hartmann R', 'Wisniewski S', 'Berger K', 'Beck JD', 'Henze G']","['Kliniken und Polikliniken fr Kinderheilkunde und Kinderchirurgie des Universitatsklinikums Charite Medizinische Fakultat, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin.']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Learning Disabilities/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neurologic Examination/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043879 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1998 Jul-Aug;210(4):200-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043879.,,,,,,,,,,,,Untersuchung von Spatfolgen nach ZNS-Rezidiv einer akuten lymphoblastischen Leukamie im Kindesalter.,,,,,,,

Especially due to the long-term toxicity of CRT, reduction or elimination of radiotherapy appeared mandatory after cure rates of more than 70% had been achieved in ALL. The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) Study Group initiated several attempts in certain ALL subgroups to omit or reduce CRT while using more CNS-directed chemotherapy but without extended intrathecal treatment during maintenance therapy. This analysis summarizes the essential results that are in particular relevant because irradiation of the central nervous system (CNS) has been further reduced in the most recent trial ALL-BFM 95. PATIENTS AND METHODS: More than 4000 patients enrolled between 1981 and 1995 in one of the last four ALL-BFM trials have been analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency of intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy with or without reduced CRT in the prevention of CNS relapses. RESULTS: In trial ALL-BFM81, it was shown that only in low-risk (LR) patients preventive radiotherapy can be replaced safely by intermediate dose (0.5 g/m2) methotrexate (MHD-MTX). In intermediate risk (IR) patients this attempt failed: IR pts had 8 times more CNS relapses if treated by MHD-MTX without CRT. In the subsequent trial ALL-BFM 83, all pts received MHD-MTX. IR pts were randomly treated with 12 or 18 Gy of preventive CRT which did not result in a significantly different outcome. The results from the subsequent trial ALL-BFM 86, using a more intensive consolidation with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), demonstrated that the elimination of CRT in low-risk ALL, the reduced CRT of 12 Gy for IR, 18 Gy for medium (MR), and the reduced CRT with 18 Gy for high risk (HR) ALL, respectively, was justified: the incidence of relapses with CNS involvement was reduced to less than 5% (Reiter et al. 1994, Blood 84: 3122). When even less intensive preventive CRT (12 Gy for all medium and high risk patients) was used in trial ALL-BFM 90, the rate of CNS-related relapses was again below 5%. HR patients now treated with more CNS-directed chemotherapy had the lowest rate of CNS-related relapses observed so far in the BFM trials, even though CRT was also reduced to 12 Gy. Patients with T-cell ALL were shown to be protected from CNS recurrence by the combination of CRT (12 Gy) and HD-MTX more effectively than by HD-MTX in consolidation and TIT therapy during maintenance, especially if they presented with high WBC as shown in a joint AIEOP/BFM analysis (Conter et al. 1997, JCO 15: 2786). Patients with overt meningeosis which are characterized by a high leukemic cell load at diagnosis had a rate of recurrences that was comparable to that of patients with high WBC but no CNS disease. CONCLUSION: Low-risk ALL patients can be efficiently prevented from CNS relapse by intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy without CRT. Patients with intermediate or medium risk ALL, including T-cell ALL, did not suffer from more CNS or systemic relapses when CRT was reduced to only 12 Gy. Patients with inadequate response to therapy are at particularly high risk for relapse with CNS involvement. Therefore, more CNS-directed systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy was applied in trial ALL-BFM 90, combined with only 12 Gy cranial irradiation, and improved the control of CNS recurrence. It seems likely that larger subsets of B-precursor ALL can be protected from CNS-related relapse by intensive chemotherapy without extended IT treatment and without CRT. This is being investigated in the ongoing trial ALL-BFM 95.","['Schrappe, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Henze, G', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Bode, U', 'Kuhl, J', 'Gadner, H', 'Havers, W', 'Pluss, H', 'Kornhuber, B', 'Zintl, F', 'Ritter, J', 'Urban, C', 'Niethammer, D', 'Riehm, H']","['Schrappe M', 'Reiter A', 'Henze G', 'Niemeyer C', 'Bode U', 'Kuhl J', 'Gadner H', 'Havers W', 'Pluss H', 'Kornhuber B', 'Zintl F', 'Ritter J', 'Urban C', 'Niethammer D', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemic Infiltration/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043878 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1998 Jul-Aug;210(4):192-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043878.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was based on the German Childhood Cancer Registry. It was restricted to cases from West Germany and extended retrospectively until 1980 for children who were living in regions covered by a previous incidence study on nuclear installations (21). The study was conducted in close correspondence with a preceding case control study in Lower Saxony (13). Results of this study and of others published in the literature were used to define explicit hypotheses for the present study. This paper presents the methodology of the study and gives an overview of some basic results. More detailed analyses of the investigated potential risk factors will be published elsewhere. The study comprised a total of 2358 cases (leukaemias, lymphomas, selected tumours) and 2588 controls. Response rates were 81% for cases and 67% for controls. For leukaemias, the main results regarding maternal factors, pregnancy, birth, immune system, ionising radiation, parental occupation and environmental factors were as follows: Positive associations were observed between childhood leukaemias and young maternal age at birth, high birth weight, tonsillectomy and use of pesticides. Some results suggest a protective effect for allergies and vaccinations. A negative association was observed with maternal smoking and childhood leukaemia. No associations were found with frequency of stillbirths, maternal alcohol consumption, parental exposure to benzene and use of wood preservatives. X-ray examinations in early childhood and parental radiation exposure did not show any consistent associations with leukaemia. Potential risk factors were not reported more frequently by cases and controls living in 114 communities with increased incidence rates. The strength of our study lies in the large number of participating families and in the population-based approach.","['Kaatsch, P', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Meinert, R', 'Miesner, A', 'Hoisl, M', 'Schuz, J', 'Michaelis, J']","['Kaatsch P', 'Kaletsch U', 'Meinert R', 'Miesner A', 'Hoisl M', 'Schuz J', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation, Universitat Mainz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors']",1998/09/23 00:00,1998/09/23 00:01,['1998/09/23 00:00'],"['1998/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043877 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1998 Jul-Aug;210(4):185-91. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043877.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After long-term course of myelodysplastic syndrome an acceleration towards acute myeloic leukemia is a frequent finding. Involvement of the eye is a well known phenomenon in acute leukemia or in blast crisis with chronic leukemias. Eye involvement in myelodysplastic syndrome showing its transition into acute myeloic leukemia however has been published in only few cases. CASE REPORT: We present a 70-year-old male patient suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome, complaining of an acute visual decrease to 0.05 in the left eye. Clinical findings, ultrasound and fluoresceine angiography were in accordance with choroidal infiltration. From the hematologic findings, the myelodysplastic syndrome had been in partial remission after chemotherapy without any sign of relapse or exacerbation. Only because of the ophthalmologic diagnosis, bone marrow aspiration was performed and revealed progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloic leukemia. Prompt administration of chemotherapy and external radiation of the posterior pol of the eye led to complete resolution of the fundus lesion within 10 days and visual acuity recovered to 0.8. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge this is the first patient with a choroidal infiltration as the initial sign of progression of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloic leukemia.

Having previously demonstrated that the aptameric oligonucleotide, ODN-1, could inhibit p210bcr-abl kinase activity, the current study sought to determine if ODN-1 could selectively inhibit the growth of CML cells relative to that of normal bone marrow. ODN-1, when introduced by electroporation into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with CML, decreased the number of committed progenitors (CML CFU-GM) by an average of 67%+/-19% (mean+/-SEM, range 28-98%). Treatment of CML PBMC with ODN-1 was also shown to decrease the number of more primitive cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC) by 35%-87%. In contrast, there was little suppressive effect by the combination of electroporation and ODN-1 on either CFU-GM or CAFC numbers from normal donor bone marrow. These studies suggest that inhibition of p210bcr-abl protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity by ODN-1 is associated with some degree of selective growth inhibition of p210bcr-abl-transformed cells. p210bcr-abl kinase inhibitory agents may be useful for the ex vivo purging of bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor/stem cells in the setting of autologous transplantation for CML.","['Schwartz, G N', 'Liu, Y Q', 'Tisdale, J', 'Walshe, K', 'Fowler, D', 'Gress, R', 'Bergan, R C']","['Schwartz GN', 'Liu YQ', 'Tisdale J', 'Walshe K', 'Fowler D', 'Gress R', 'Bergan RC']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/oli.1.1998.8.329 [doi]'],ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998 Aug;8(4):329-39. doi: 10.1089/oli.1.1998.8.329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to be capable of directing ribonuclease H (RNase H) cleavage of their target mRNAs. Streptolysin O (SLO) reversible permeabilization was used to deliver the oligodeoxynucleotides into the CML line KYO-1. We found that the efficiency and specificity of antisense oligonucleotide-induced reductions of target protein expression depended on target protein half-life, the oligonucleotide structure, and the specific sequence within the target mRNA. Transient reductions of c-myc mRNA and protein were achieved with a chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to the initiation codon, but cell proliferation was unaffected. In contrast, a chimeric oligodeoxynucleotide of similar structure targeted to an alternative site in the coding region of c-myc mRNA reduced target mRNA and protein levels for over 24 hours and halted cell proliferation. Chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to a point mutation in KYO-1 p53 mRNA efficiently reduced target mRNA expression, but only small, transient reductions in p53 protein expression were observed. However, a chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide targeted to the same site reduced p53 protein to 30% of control levels over a 48-hour period.

It may be that IL-2 and IFN-alpha are often not sufficiently effective because intratumoral monocytes/macrophages (MO) inhibit the cytokine-induced activation of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes such as NK-cells at the site of tumor growth. An essential part of this inhibitory signal is conveyed by MO-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), which potently inhibit NK-cell-related functions, including the constitutive and cytokine-induced cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Histamine, a biogenic amine, inhibits ROS formation in MO; thereby, histamine synergizes with IL-2 and with IFN-alpha to induce killing of NK-cell-sensitive human tumor cells in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with histamine potentiates cytokine-induced killing of NK-cell-sensitive murine tumor cells in vivo. In ongoing clinical trials, histamine has been added to IL-2 or IFN-alpha in immunotherapy of human neoplastic disease. The results of two pilot trials in metastatic melanoma suggest that the addition of histamine to IL-2/IFN-alpha prolongs survival time and induces regression of tumors, such as liver melanoma, which are considered refractory to immunotherapy with IL-2 or IFN-alpha.

The anti-CD151 mAb coprecipitated alpha 5 beta 1 integrin from HTLV-1-infected T cells. Conversely, an anti-alpha 5 integrin mAb coprecipitated CD151. The anti-CD151 mAb inhibited the adhesion of HTLV-1-infected T cells to fibronectin but did not have any effect on their adhesion to laminin, collagen type I, or collagen type IV. Moreover, antisense CD151 oligonucleotide-treated HTLV-1-infected T cells showed significant inhibition of adhesion to fibronectin. These findings showed that the CD151 molecule was associated with the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin molecule and that it enhanced alpha 5 beta 1 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin. In addition, the expression levels of CD151, alpha 4 beta 1 integrin, and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on ATL cells from lymph nodes of lymphoma-type ATL patients were significantly higher than those on circulating ATL cells from leukemia-type ATL patients. This suggests that the increased expression of these integrins may contribute to lymphoma formation through the adhesion of ATL cells to the extracellular matrix and dendritic cells, rather than contributing to transmigration.","['Hasegawa, H', 'Nomura, T', 'Kishimoto, K', 'Yanagisawa, K', 'Fujita, S']","['Hasegawa H', 'Nomura T', 'Kishimoto K', 'Yanagisawa K', 'Fujita S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine, Shigenobu, Japan. hitoshih@m.ehime-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD151 protein, human)', '0 (Cd151 protein, mouse)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Tetraspanin 24)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/immunology/physiology', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*virology', 'Tetraspanin 24', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Sep 15;161(6):3087-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study demonstrates that a hormone-dependent activation of Tax promotes an enhanced prooxidant state in stably transfected Jurkat cells as measured by changes in the intracellular levels of glutathione and H2O2; these changes are followed by apoptotic cell death. Additional stimulation of the CD3/TCR pathway enhances the oxidative and apoptotic effects. Both Tax-mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress can be potently suppressed by antioxidants, as is seen with the administration of recombinant thioredoxin (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Hormone-induced Tax activation induces a long-lasting activation of NF-kappaB, which is a major target of reactive oxygen intermediates. The long-term exposure of Jurkat cells to hormone eventually results in a selection of cell clones that have lost Tax activity. A subsequent transfection of these apparently ""nonresponsive"" clones allows the recovery of Tax responses in these cells. Our observations indicate that changes in the intracellular redox status may be a determining factor in Tax-mediated DNA damage, apoptosis, and selection against the long-term expression of Tax function.","['Los, M', 'Khazaie, K', 'Schulze-Osthoff, K', 'Baeuerle, P A', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Chlichlia, K']","['Los M', 'Khazaie K', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Chlichlia K']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Eberhard-Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Oxidants/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Sep 15;161(6):3050-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, target lysis via the granule exocytosis pathway is completely resistant to caspase inhibitors. To test the possibility that granzymes trigger a postcaspase cytoplasmic apoptotic pathway leading to lysis, we have examined the caspase dependence of several cytoplasmic changes associated with apoptotic death. Rapid prelytic phosphatidylserine externalization was induced in Jurkat target cells by both the Fas ligand (FasL)/Fas and the granule exocytosis effector pathways. This was specifically blocked by peptide ketone caspase inhibitors when induced by the former, but not by the latter, pathway. A rapid prelytic loss of target mitochondrial psi was also induced by both CTL effector pathways, and this was also specifically blocked by caspase inhibitors when induced by the FasL/Fas, but not by the granule exocytosis, pathway. Similarly, target membrane blebbing induced by CTL via the FasL/Fas, but not via the granule exocytosis, effector pathway was specifically blocked by caspase inhibitors. In contrast to the above nonnuclear damage, CTL-induced target staining by the lipid probe FM1-43 reflecting plasma membrane endocytosis was blocked by caspase inhibitors. Thus, when caspase activation is blocked, the granule exocytosis pathway triggers several parameters of target apoptotic damage in addition to lysis, suggesting that granzymes directly trigger a postcaspase cytoplasmic apoptotic death pathway.","['Sarin, A', 'Haddad, E K', 'Henkart, P A']","['Sarin A', 'Haddad EK', 'Henkart PA']","['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-1360, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology/pathology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Exocytosis/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mitochondria/immunology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Sep 15;161(6):2810-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clouding our understanding has been the reported discrepancies in expression and function of the B7-1 (CD80) molecule based upon the use of the BB1 vs other anti-B7-1 mAbs. To resolve this issue, we have cloned a BB1-binding molecule from the BB1+B7-1(-) NALM-6 pre-B cell line. Here, we demonstrate that this BB1-binding molecule is identical to the cell surface form of CD74 (MHC class II-associated invariant chain). CD74-transfected cells bound the BB1 mAb but not other anti-CD80 mAbs, CD28-Ig, or CTLA4Ig. Absorption and blocking experiments confirmed the reactivity of BB1 mAb with CD74. A region of weak homology was identified between CD74 and the region of B7-1 encoding the BB1 epitope. Therefore, the BB1 mAb binds to a protein distinct from B7-1, and this epitope is also present on the B7-1 protein. Many of the puzzling observations in the literature concerning the expression of human B7-1 are resolved by an understanding that BB1 staining is the summation of CD74 plus B7-1 expression. This observation requires the field to reconsider studies using BB1 mAb in the analysis of CD80 expression and function.","['Freeman, G J', 'Cardoso, A A', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Anumanthan, A', 'Groves, R W', 'Kupper, T S', 'Clark, E A', 'Nadler, L M']","['Freeman GJ', 'Cardoso AA', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Anumanthan A', 'Groves RW', 'Kupper TS', 'Clark EA', 'Nadler LM']","[""Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. gordon freeman@macmailgw.dfci.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (invariant chain)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abatacept', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/immunology', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Sep 15;161(6):2708-15.,,"['AI 25082/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 39671/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with bulky stage II and stage III non-seminomatous germ cell tumors are treated with chemotherapy. The new international classification system has provided a very useful way to categorize these patients by prognosis. Patients with good- or intermediate-risk tumors may be treated with 3 courses of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (BEP) or 4 courses of etoposide and cisplatin (EP), and more than 90% of these patients will survive. Randomized trials have shown that, if only 3 courses of chemotherapy are to be given, the substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin and the omission of bleomycin are deleterious to outcome. Patients who still have a significant residual mass and normal markers after treatment should undergo a surgical resection of the residual tumor. Patients who are classified by the international classification system as having poor-risk tumors have about a 50% likelihood of survival, and many of these patients will require surgical resection of a residual tumor after chemotherapy. No randomized trial has proved a regimen to be superior to that of 4 courses of BEP. Currently, an ongoing trial is evaluating the effect of the early use of high-dose therapy in combination with hematopoietic rescue in patients with these types of tumors. Patients with small-volume stage II tumors are generally treated with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). About 25% of the patients selected for this procedure will actually have pathologically negative nodes. Those with positive nodes may elect to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (2 courses of BEP), which will almost always prevent relapse. An alternate approach for patients willing to comply with monthly follow-up is surveillance, with chemotherapy deferred until relapse is noted. About 50% of these patients will be cured with surgery (as many as 75% have microscopic disease only). With careful follow-up, those destined to relapse can be treated promptly and at a time when they have small-volume tumors and an excellent prognosis if they go on to receive chemotherapy. Patients with clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors may also undergo RPLND, although an acceptable alternative for these patients is surveillance. The advantages and the disadvantages of each approach are discussed. The overall risk of recurrence is about 30%, but there have been patient groups defined that may vary in risk from 10% to 15% up to 50% or more. Patients with advanced seminoma are treated with chemotherapy. When this procedure is used, outcomes are favorable and all patients are either in good- or intermediate-risk groups, according to the international classification system. Patients with small-volume stage II tumors are treated with radiotherapy. Radiation is also generally used for the treatment of clinical stage I patients, although surveillance is growing in prominence as a means to treat these patients. Late effects of treatment are also discussed in this article. Ejaculatory function can be preserved in most patients who have early stage tumors and who undergo RPLND and in some patients who undergo surgery after chemotherapy. The most troubling effect of chemotherapy is the development of etoposide-induced leukemia, a unique--and fortunately rare--clinical entity.","['Nichols, C R']",['Nichols CR'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Germinoma/diagnosis/secondary/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/therapy', 'Orchiectomy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seminoma/diagnosis/secondary/therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0147-0272(98)90012-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0147-0272(98)90012-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1998 Jul-Aug;22(4):187-274. doi: 10.1016/s0147-0272(98)90012-5.,,,,,294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decade, the use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a source of hematopoietic stem cells has revolutionized the field of BMT, providing a source of hematopoietic stem cells for an increasing number of patients in need of a transplant. RESULTS: Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) appears to result in sustained engraftment of donor hematopoiesis similar to results achieved with marrow and peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Early results indicate that UCBT is associated with a lower incidence and less severity of graft-versus-host disease than other sources of stem cells, potentially decreasing the morbidity and mortality of BMT. As the potential of UCBT has been realized, cord blood storage facilities have been established to provide UCB. The rapid emergence of UCBT has transformed a waste product of birth into a life-saving resource. Its use, however; has raised numerous ethical and medical concerns unique to this alternative source of stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical cord blood transplantation represents a major advance in providing another stem cell source to patients in need of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As with all new technologies, UCBT will have to be carefully studied over the next several years to determine its safety, efficacy, and precise indications in comparison with other sources of hematopoietic stem cells. The ethics of UCBT must properly respect the rights and needs of both donors and recipients.","['Kline, R M', 'Bertolone, S J']","['Kline RM', 'Bertolone SJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/therapy', 'Tissue Donors']",1998/09/22 00:00,1998/09/22 00:01,['1998/09/22 00:00'],"['1998/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,South Med J. 1998 Sep;91(9):821-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion mutagenesis of the MoMLV derived sequences allowed this function to be localised to a 312 nt length sequence overlapping the MoMLV gag p15/p12 open reading frame. This 'extended packaging sequence' has been reported to markedly increase the titre of in vitro packaged retroviral vectors. Using fluorescent in situ hybridisation combined with confocal microscopy we show that the 312 nt element can replace Rex mediated nuclear export and expression of transcripts containing HTLV-1 cis acting repressive elements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of patients were included in the study: 51 patients with lymphogranulomatosis (LGM), 33 healthy relatives of these patients, 37 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 24 healthy relatives of these CML patients. 224 donors served control. HLA-antigens were identified with the lymphocytoxic test and PSR-MSSR. Results of typing of class II antigens were taken into consideration in coincidence of serological and DNA typing. The significance of the differences was estimated according to the chi-square criterion. RESULTS: Differences in frequency of distribution of HLA-antigens (subloci A and B) were not found. Antigen CW7 was present in 70, DR5 in 60, DR6 in 50% of LGM patients. This frequency was much higher than in control groups. Carriers of CW7 are at 7 times higher risk to develop LGM. Among LGM patients the number of homozygous individuals is higher than in healthy ones (50 and 15.6%) while the number of individuals with a complete set of HLA-A.B antigens is significantly less. CONCLUSION: Genetic predisposition to LGM is predetermined by HLA antigens CW7, DR5, DR6. Genes HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR7 protect carriers from factors provoking LGM.

RESULTS: High expression of MDR-1 gene occurred in leukemic blast cells either upon achievement of CCHR or at least 6 months after its onset. When using schemes of chemotherapy containing two potential inductors of gene MDR-1, expression of this gene was registered significantly more frequently than in using schemes based on one inducing drug (p < 0.05).

The ability of E2A-HLF to prolong the survival of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cells after IL-3 withdrawal suggests that it disrupts signaling pathways normally responsible for cell suicide, allowing the cells to accumulate as transformed lymphoblasts. To determine the structural motifs that contribute to this antiapoptotic effect, we constructed a panel of E2A-HLF mutants and programmed their expression in IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cells (FL5.12 line), using a zinc-inducible vector. Neither the E12 nor the E47 product of the E2A gene nor the wild-type HLF protein was able to protect the cells from apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation. Surprisingly, different combinations of disabling mutations within the HLF bZIP domain had little effect on the antiapoptotic property of the chimeric protein, so long as the amino-terminal portion of E2A remained intact. In the context of a bZIP domain defective in DNA binding, mutants retaining either of the two transactivation domains of E2A were able to extend cell survival after growth factor deprivation. Thus, the block of apoptosis imposed by E2A-HLF in pro-B lymphocytes depends critically on the transactivating regions of E2A. Since neither DNA binding nor protein dimerization through the bZIP domain of HLF is required for this effect, we propose mechanisms whereby protein-protein interactions with the amino-terminal region of E2A allow the chimera to act as a transcriptional cofactor to alter the expression of genes regulating the apoptotic machinery in pro-B cells.","['Inukai, T', 'Inaba, T', 'Ikushima, S', 'Look, A T']","['Inukai T', 'Inaba T', 'Ikushima S', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', '*Leucine Zippers', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1998/09/19 00:00,1998/09/19 00:01,['1998/09/19 00:00'],"['1998/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.10.6035 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Oct;18(10):6035-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.10.6035.,,"['CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC109189,,,,

Transmitted light spectra of two nuclear domains were determined, one with low-intensity light transmittance (LIT) and the other with high-intensity light transmittance (HIT). A spectral library was constructed using the four transmitted light spectra representing the HIT and LIT domains of the normal human lymphocytes and the LIT and HIT domains of the CLL cells. The spectral library served to scan CLL lymphocytes from 10 cases of CLL and the lymphocytes of 10 healthy individuals. Each spectrally similar domain in the nuclei of the lymphocytes was assigned an arbitrary color. The morphometric analysis of the spectrally classified nuclei showed specific spectral patterns for B-CLL in 92% of the cells. The specific spectral characteristics of each of the two cell populations were also observed by their optical density light absorbance spectra.

Retroviral replication requires both of these activities. The RNase H domain is responsible for hydrolysis of the RNA portion of RNA x DNA hybrids, and this activity requires the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) that bind its active site. This domain is a part of a large family of homologous RNase H enzymes of which the RNase HI protein from Escherichia coli is the best characterized. Although the isolated RNase H domain from human immunodeficiency virus RT is inactive, the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) domain is active in the absence of the polymerase domain, making functional studies more accessible. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we characterized the stability and folding of two different fragments of MMLV RT that retain RNase H activity. The smaller fragment corresponding to the 157 C-terminal residues of RT is predominantly unfolded in the absence of divalent cations, but folding can be induced by the addition of metal. The larger fragment corresponding to the 175 C-terminal residues, however, is stably folded in the absence of metal. Thus, an 18 residue N-terminal extension outside the region homologous to E. coli RNase HI is important for the structural stability of the RNase H domain of MMLV RT. Therefore, this region should be considered part of the RNase H domain.","['Goedken, E R', 'Marqusee, S']","['Goedken ER', 'Marqusee S']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Manganese/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Folding', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*chemistry/metabolism']",1998/09/19 02:17,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/19 02:17'],"['1998/09/19 02:17 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/19 02:17 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(19981001)33:1<135::AID-PROT12>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]'],ppublish,Proteins. 1998 Oct 1;33(1):135-43.,,['GM53321/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oxidative DNA base modification induced by cupric nitrilotriacetate (Cu-NTA) and the following apoptosis were observed in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. We measured the level of ROS in the cells by using a fluorescence probe, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), and the amount of a modified DNA base, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) by HPLC-ECD. It was found that Cu-NTA exposure significantly enhanced ROS and 8-OHdG formation in the cells. Meanwhile, we observed both DNA fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, which was also determined quantitatively by flow cytometry and showed dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, several antioxidants such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase were used to detect whether the apoptosis could be blocked. Only DMSO protected against this form of cell death. To elucidate molecular events in the apoptosis, expressions of Bcl-2 protein family members, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X and Bax, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) were measured by western blotting using specific antibodies. The levels of Bax and Bcl-Xs remained largely unchanged, but the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression showed down-regulation. After 24 h incubation in the presence of copper, the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL reduced about 33.8% and 51.1% compared with untreated cells, respectively. Furthermore, after 16 h incubation, the level of HSP-70 expression was about 3.4-fold greater than that in untreated cells, suggesting that HSP-70 is important in increasing resistance to oxidative stress induced by Cu-NTA. But overexpression of HSP-70 failed to protect HL-60 cells from apoptosis induced by Cu-NTA. We inferred that Cu-NTA may induce oxidative DNA damage through free radical injuries, which may turn on the apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Ma, Y', 'Cao, L', 'Kawabata, T', 'Yoshino, T', 'Yang, B B', 'Okada, S']","['Ma Y', 'Cao L', 'Kawabata T', 'Yoshino T', 'Yang BB', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'D034E84B7S (cupric nitrilotriacetate)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'KA90006V9D (Nitrilotriacetic Acid)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", '*Apoptosis', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Nitrilotriacetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",1998/09/19 00:00,1998/09/19 00:01,['1998/09/19 00:00'],"['1998/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(98)00088-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00088-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1998 Sep;25(4-5):568-75. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00088-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For in vivo gene transfer, it is desirable to have an rAAV vector that specifically transduces selected target cells. As a first step toward generating an rAAV vector capable of targeting delivery in vivo, we have engineered a chimeric protein combining the AAV capsid protein and the variable region of a single-chain antibody against human CD34 molecules, a cell surface marker for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Inclusion of the chimeric CD34 single-chain antibody-AAV capsid proteins within an rAAV virion significantly increased the preferential infectivity of rAAV for the CD34+ human myoleukemia cell line KG-1, which is normally refractory to rAAV transduction. Antibodies against the single-chain antibody and the CD34 protein blocked this transduction. This chimeric vector represents a significant improvement in the host range of rAAV and the first step toward specific gene delivery by rAAV vectors to cells of choice, in this case, hematopoietic progenitor cells, for the treatment of human disease.","['Yang, Q', 'Mamounas, M', 'Yu, G', 'Kennedy, S', 'Leaker, B', 'Merson, J', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Yu, M', 'Barber, J R']","['Yang Q', 'Mamounas M', 'Yu G', 'Kennedy S', 'Leaker B', 'Merson J', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Yu M', 'Barber JR']","['Immusol, Inc., San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Antibodies, Blocking', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD34/immunology/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biomarkers', 'Capsid/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dependovirus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virion']",1998/09/19 00:00,1998/09/19 00:01,['1998/09/19 00:00'],"['1998/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.13-1929 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Sep 1;9(13):1929-37. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.13-1929.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the fine-needle aspiration findings of an additional case of metastatic basaloid squamous carcinoma in a cervical lymph node and compare its cytomorphologic features to those observed on touch imprints of the subsequent surgical specimen. Smears of the aspirate showed a mixed lymphoid background with interspersed cohesive clusters of small cells roughly 3 times the size of small mature lymphocytes. Some cells were angulated and others exhibited irregular nuclear contours. The cells were generally hyperchromatic with evenly staining dense chromatin or irregularly distributed coarse chromatin. Focally there was evidence of nuclear molding. On Diff-Quik staining, irregular globules of magenta-stained extracellular dense material were noted within or adherent to the periphery of some clusters or as somewhat linear formations with small epithelial cells clinging to the edges. Abundant mitotic figures and clumps of necrotic tumor were more apparent on touch preps of the subsequent surgical specimen.

To exploit the schedule dependency of etoposide, which favors longer exposure, a Phase II trial of prolonged oral etoposide was conducted in this tumor. METHODS: Eligibility included leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, measurable disease, one prior chemotherapy regimen which did not include etoposide, WBC >/= 3000/microliter, platelet count >/=100, 000/microliter, serum creatinine </=2 mg%, and adequate hepatic function. The starting etoposide dose was 50 mg/m2/day (30-40 mg/m2/day for prior radiotherapy) as a single dose for 21 days, every 28 days. Based on toxicity, a dose escalation to a maximum etoposide dose of 60 mg/m2/day was prescribed. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were entered on this study; 34 were evaluable for toxicity and 29 were evaluable for response. A median of 2 courses were given (range 1-14). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 20.6% and grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 5.8%. One patient developed acute myeloid leukemia 10 months after completing 7 cycles of therapy.

However, as neither mice lacking LIF nor mice lacking the LIF receptor show defects in PGC growth, an alternate cytokine for PGC growth has been postulated. We investigated the role of mouse oncostatin M (mOSM), which is structurally and functionally related to LIF, in germ cell development. While LIF enhanced the survival of migratory as well as postmigratory PGCs, mOSM acted only on the postmigratory PGCs. Consistent with its biological activity, mOSM was found to be expressed in developing gonads. In the male, Sertoli cells in neonatal testis express mOSM; however, its expression is downregulated in adult testes. Moreover, mOSM enhanced the proliferation of Sertoli cells derived from neonatal testes in vitro more than human OSM or LIF. In contrast, postnatal ovaries do not express mOSM. These results indicate that mOSM is a stage- and sex-specific autocrine growth factor for Sertoli cells.","['Hara, T', 'Tamura, K', 'de Miguel, M P', 'Mukouyama, Y', 'Kim, H j', 'Kogo, H', 'Donovan, P J', 'Miyajima, A']","['Hara T', 'Tamura K', 'de Miguel MP', 'Mukouyama Y', 'Kim Hj', 'Kogo H', 'Donovan PJ', 'Miyajima A']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0032, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (inhibin-alpha subunit)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Germ Cells/*drug effects', 'Gonads/cytology/growth & development', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Inhibins', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/embryology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sertoli Cells/*drug effects']",1998/09/19 00:00,1998/09/19 00:01,['1998/09/19 00:00'],"['1998/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012160698989904 [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1998.8990 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1998 Sep 15;201(2):144-53. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1998.8990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

The most common dose-limiting toxicity is neutropenia, while other reported toxicities are minimal. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is an anthracene derivative that has demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, acute leukemia, and lymphoma. Mitoxantrone also has a very favorable toxicity profile with significantly less nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and stomatitis as compared with anthracyclines. The dose-limiting toxicity for mitoxantrone is leukopenia. The study was designed to determine the safety and maximally tolerated dose of IV vinorelbine used in combination with a fixed dose of mitoxantrone for the treatment of patients with refractory solid tumors. Vinorelbine was administered on days 1 and 8 of the treatment regimen as a short IV infusion. The starting dose was 15 mg/m2. Mitoxantrone was administered as a 20-min infusion on day 1 only at a fixed dose of 10 mg/m2. Seventeen patients with solid malignancies were entered in the study. For personal reasons, one patient decided to discontinue the treatment after day 1 of cycle 1. Therefore, 16 patients were evaluable for toxicity. The main toxicity was myelosuppression which was dose-limiting and resulted in dose reductions and delays. The use of G-CSF had a minimal overall impact on this regimen. Stable disease was observed in three cases. In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the maximally tolerated dose was defined as vinorelbine 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 on day 1 without growth factor support.

To establish whether this new Vinca alkaloid participates in P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR), VFL-resistant murine P388 cells (P388/VFL) were established in vivo and used in conjunction with the well established MDR P388/ADR subline, to define the in vivo resistance profile for VFL. P388/VFL cells proved cross-resistant to drugs implicated in MDR (other Vinca alkaloids, doxorubicin, etoposide), but not to campothecin or cisplatin and showed an increased expression of Pgp, without any detectable alterations in topoisomerase II or in glutathione metabolism. The P388/ADR cells proved cross-resistant to VFL both in vivo and in vitro, and this VFL resistance was efficiently modulated by verapamil in vitro. Cellular transport experiments with tritiated-VFL revealed differential uptake by P388 sensitive and P388/ADR resistant cells, comparable with data obtained using tritiated-NVB. In various in vitro models of human MDR tumor cells, whilst full sensitivity was retained in cells expressing alternative non-Pgp-mediated MDR mechanisms, cross resistance was identified in Pgp-overexpressing cells. Differences were, however, noted in terms of the drug resistance profiles relative to the other Vinca, with tumor cell lines proving generally least cross-resistant to VFL. Overall, these results suggest that VFL, like other Vinca alkaloids, participates in Pgp-mediated MDR, with tumor cells selected for resistance to VFL overexpressing Pgp, yet MDR tumor cell lines proved generally less cross resistant to VFL relative to the other Vinca alkaloids.","['Etievant, C', 'Barret, J M', 'Kruczynski, A', 'Perrin, D', 'Hill, B T']","['Etievant C', 'Barret JM', 'Kruczynski A', 'Perrin D', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie Experimentale I, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",1998/09/18 00:00,1998/09/18 00:01,['1998/09/18 00:00'],"['1998/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006022811895 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1998;16(1):3-17. doi: 10.1023/a:1006022811895.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, less is known about liver dysfunction in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who are undergoing chemotherapy. Thus, the authors conducted this study to determine whether chemotherapy for HCV positive patients with hematologic malignancies is associated with hepatic injury. METHODS: Thirty-three consecutive HCV positive patients were studied. Twenty-six had B-cell lymphoma, two had Hodgkin's disease, two had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), two had chronic myelocytic leukemia, and one had multiple myeloma. HCV infection was detected by anti-HCV antibodies (enzyme immunoassay) and HCV RNA (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). In 28 of 33 patients, CS were used as part of the chemotherapy regimens. Liver function tests (LFTs) were evaluated prior to chemotherapy, a mean of 19 days after each cycle of chemotherapy, and during the follow-up period after the completion of chemotherapy. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 7-26 months). RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 33 patients (82%) were positive for both anti-HCV and HCV RNA, 5 for HCV RNA only, and 1 for anti-HCV antibodies only. Fourteen patients (42%) had normal pretreatment LFTs. During treatment, 18 patients (55%) (7 with normal and 11 with abnormal pretreatment transaminase levels) had mild-to-moderate increases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (median, 156 U/L; range, 59-491) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (median, 121; range, 45-243), which occurred 2-3 weeks after the withdrawal of chemotherapy without associated hyperbilirubinemia. Only one patient with baseline ALT and AST of 182 IU/L and 117 IU/L had a severe ""flare"" of hepatitis C, with peak ALT and AST of 491 IU/L and 243 IU/L. No patient developed fulminant hepatitis or died of liver-related causes. Posttreatment levels of transaminases were not significantly different from pretreatment levels. Abnormal pretreatment transaminase levels did not predict further increase during treatment.

This study was conducted to evaluate further the efficacy and safety of rIFN-alpha-2b in a large group of patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and to determine maintenance of response after treatment discontinuation. METHODS: Induction therapy began with subcutaneous rIFN-alpha-2b at 5.0 x 10(6) IU/day until a complete or partial response was achieved. Treatment continued at 2.5 x 10(6) IU/day until spleen size and hematologic parameters stabilized. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were studied (median follow-up, 7.3 years); at last follow-up 27 patients still were participating (median follow-up, 3.8 years). Twenty-four of 24 patients with thrombocythemia (100%) and 14 of 14 patients with hyperleukocytosis (100%) responded to induction therapy, whereas 26 of 39 patients (67%) experienced > 10% decrease in splenomegaly. Thirty-nine of 54 patients (72%) maintained response for a median of 39 weeks after withdrawal of rIFN-alpha-2b; repeat courses in previously responding patients produced similar results. The survival rate at 8 years was 60%. rIFN-alpha-2b generally was well tolerated, but toxicity caused treatment withdrawal in 7 patients (13%). CONCLUSIONS: rIFN-alpha-2b can produce regression of splenomegaly and control of leukocyte and platelet counts in patients with MPD. These responses are sustained for prolonged periods in some patients after therapy discontinuation. In patients with recurrent disease, disease control can be attained again with reinitiation of rIFN-alpha-2b.

METHODS: To compare with the large series of 1095 lymphoma cases reported between 1957-1971 at Siriraj Hospital, the largest hospital in Thailand, a similar study was performed through histopathologic evaluation of 425 lymphoma cases diagnosed consecutively at the same institution between August 1993 and October 1995. Phenotypic analysis was performed by paraffin section-immunoperoxidase studies. RESULTS: A striking increase in lymphoma cases was noted from 73 cases/year in the first series to 189 cases/year in the second series (an increase of 158.9%). Lymphoma occurred in all age groups, with a peak incidence at the seventh decade of life. The male to female ratio decreased from 2:1 in 1957-1971 to 1.3:1 in the more recent series. The incidence of Hodgkin's disease (HD) was found to have decreased from 28.9% to 8.5%. There were 36 cases (8.5%) of HD and 389 cases (91.5%) of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) reported in the second series. The subtypes of HD included 16 cases of mixed cellularity, 13 cases of nodular sclerosis, 6 cases of lymphocyte depletion, and 1 case of lymphocyte predominance. According to the Working Formulation, the 389 NHL cases included low grade (14.1%), intermediate grade (57.3%), high grade (11.3%), and miscellaneous groups (17.2%). They were classified as small lymphocytic (9.5%), follicular (11.1%), diffuse (50.9%), immunoblastic (4.1%), small noncleaved (4.4%), lymphoblastic (2.8%), anaplastic large cell (9.0%), mycosis fungoides (1.8%), hairy cell leukemia (0.3%), true histiocytic (0.5%), and extramedullary plasmacytoma (1.0%).

To determine the role of this cytokine in the central nervous system in vivo, we examined the brains of young and adult mice in which the LIF gene was disrupted. Immunohistochemical staining of neurons for choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin, parvalbumin, calbindin, neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide revealed no significant differences between null mutant and wild-type (WT) brains. In contrast, analysis of glial phenotypes demonstrated striking deficits in the LIF-knockout brain. Staining with several anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells in various regions of the hippocampus in the female mutant is much lower than in the WT. The null male hippocampus also displays a significant, though less marked deficit. The number of astrocytes in the mutant hippocampus, as determined by S-100 staining, is not, however, significantly different from WT. In addition, quantification of immunohistochemical staining of female, but not male, mutants reveals a significant deficit in myelin basic protein content in three brain regions, suggesting alterations in oligodendrocytes as well. Thus, while overall brain histology appears normal, the absence of LIF in vivo leads to specific, sexually dimorphic alterations in glial phenotype.","['Bugga, L', 'Gadient, R A', 'Kwan, K', 'Stewart, C L', 'Patterson, P H']","['Bugga L', 'Gadient RA', 'Kwan K', 'Stewart CL', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (S100 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/*cytology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*deficiency/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Neuroglia/*physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism', 'Sex Characteristics']",1998/09/18 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/18 02:02'],"['1998/09/18 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/18 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(19980915)36:4<509::AID-NEU5>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19980915)36:4<509::aid-neu5>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1998 Sep 15;36(4):509-24. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19980915)36:4<509::aid-neu5>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether these findings were attributable to intensified surveillance, shared risk factors, or increased cancer susceptibility remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a history of NMSC predicts cancer mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort with 12-year mortality follow-up adjusted for multiple risk factors. SETTING: Cancer Prevention Study II, United States and Puerto Rico. PARTICIPANTS: Nearly 1.1 million adult volunteers who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1982. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Deaths due to all cancers and common cancers. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race, education, smoking, obesity, alcohol use, and other conventional risk factors, a baseline history of NMSC was associated with increased total cancer mortality (men's relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.36; women's RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.35). Exclusion of deaths due to melanoma reduced these RRs only slightly. Mortality was increased for the following cancers: melanoma (RR, 3.36 in men, 3.52 in women); pharynx (RR, 2.77 in men, 2.81 in women); lung (RR, 1.37 in men, 1.46 in women); non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR, 1.32 in men, 1.50 in women); in men only, salivary glands (RR, 2.96), prostate (RR, 1.28), testis (RR, 12.7), urinary bladder (RR, 1.41), and leukemia (RR, 1.37); and in women only, breast (RR, 1.34). All-cause mortality was slightly increased (adjusted men's RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00-1.06]; women's RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00-1.09]). CONCLUSIONS: Persons with a history of NMSC are at increased risk of cancer mortality. Although the biological mechanisms are unknown, a history of NMSC should increase the clinician's alertness for certain noncutaneous cancers as well as melanoma.","['Kahn, H S', 'Tatham, L M', 'Patel, A V', 'Thun, M J', 'Heath, C W Jr']","['Kahn HS', 'Tatham LM', 'Patel AV', 'Thun MJ', 'Heath CW Jr']","['Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA. hkahn@emory.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Puerto Rico/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*mortality', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/09/18 02:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/09/18 02:02'],"['1998/09/18 02:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/09/18 02:02 [entrez]']","['jbr80075 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.280.10.910 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 1998 Sep 9;280(10):910-2. doi: 10.1001/jama.280.10.910.,,,['JAMA. 1999 Jan 27;281(4):325.

We report a case of paraneoplastic pemphigus associated with chronic lymphoid leukemia involving the tracheobronchial epithelium. CASE REPORT: A patient with chronic lymphoid leukemia developed pluriorificial lesions. There were several conjunctival, buccal and genital erosions associated with erosive plaques on the trunk, Nikolski's sign and bullous lesions suggestive of paraneoplastic pemphigus. Histology examination of a bulla showed intraepidermal blistering and suprabasal acantholysis. Direct immunofluorescence evidenced intercellular IgG and C3 deposits. Search for anti-intercellular substance antibodies was positive with fluorescence on specific paraneoplastic pemphigus substrates. At immunotransfer, the serum recognized several bands corresponding to 250, 230, 210 and 190 kD antigens, confirming the diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus. Several days later, the patient's general condition deteriorated with bronchorrhea. Bronchial endoscopy visualized ulceronecrotic plaques. Tracheal biopsy evidenced acantholytic cells and intraepithelial cleavage. General corticosteroid therapy was initiated and led to improvement of the skin lesions but the patient died rapidly from pneumonia. Autopsy confirmed the presence of epithelial cleavage and acantholysis involving the trachea and bronchi. DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the difficulty of diagnosing paraneoplastic pemphigus in the early stages. The pluriorificial lesions were suggestive of a Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Besides the genital, conjunctival and buccal mucosa, other mucosa can be involved. In our case, despite the absence of an immunological element, histology was highly suggestive of specific tracheobronchial localizations. The presence of such lesions, which should be searched for in all cases with bronchopulmonary manifestations, worsens the prognosis.","['Segard-Drouard, M', 'Lefebvre, I', 'Catteau, B', 'Pannequin, C', 'Delaporte, E', 'Janin, A', 'Thomas, P']","['Segard-Drouard M', 'Lefebvre I', 'Catteau B', 'Pannequin C', 'Delaporte E', 'Janin A', 'Thomas P']","['Clinique Dermatologique, Hopital Claude Huriez, CHRU, Lille.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Acantholysis/etiology/pathology', 'Bronchial Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Paraneoplastic Syndromes', 'Pemphigus/*complications/pathology', 'Tracheal Diseases/*etiology/pathology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/09/18 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AD-09-1997-124-9-0151-9638-101019-ART92 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1997;124(9):615-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,Pemphigus paraneoplasique avec atteinte tracheo-bronchique.,,,,,,,

In immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) exposed to low doses of natural sunlight, the yield of oxidative DNA base modifications sensitive to the repair endonuclease formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg protein) generated by this indirect mechanism was 10% of that of pyrimidine dimers (generated by direct DNA excitation). A similar yield of Fpg-sensitive modifications, which include 8-hydroxyguanine, was observed in primary keratinocytes. The relative yield of oxidative base modifications decreased at higher light doses, probably as a result of photodecomposition of the endogenous chromophore involved. For the three cell lines tested, viz. HaCaT cells, L1210 mouse leukemia cells and AS52 Chinese hamster cells, the yield of oxidative base modifications generated by a low dose of visible light appeared to be correlated with the basal concentrations of porphyrins in the cells. Induction of cellular porphyrin synthesis by pretreatment with 5-aminolaevulinic acid increased the light-induced oxidative damage in L1210 cells several-fold. In both induced and uninduced cells, the damage was inhibited by more than 50% in the presence of ascorbic acid (100 microM), while alpha-tocopherol and the iron chelator alpha-phenanthroline had no effect and beta-carotene even increased the damage. Even high doses of visible light did not significantly increase the numbers of micronuclei in L1210 cells or of gpt mutations in AS52 cells. The negative outcome can be fully explained by the photobleaching of the endogenous photosensitizers, which prevents the generation of sufficiently high levels of oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, the mutagenic risk arising from the indirectly generated oxidative DNA modifications induced by sunlight may be underestimated when results obtained at high doses are extrapolated to low doses or low dose rates.","['Pflaum, M', 'Kielbassa, C', 'Garmyn, M', 'Epe, B']","['Pflaum M', 'Kielbassa C', 'Garmyn M', 'Epe B']","['Institute of Pharmacy, University of Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Porphyrins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.23 (DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cricetinae', '*DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Keratinocytes/chemistry/*enzymology/radiation effects', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Porphyrins/analysis', 'Riboflavin/pharmacology']",1998/09/18 00:00,1998/09/18 00:01,['1998/09/18 00:00'],"['1998/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0921-8777(98)00029-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0921-8777(98)00029-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1998 Aug 7;408(2):137-46. doi: 10.1016/s0921-8777(98)00029-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involved spinal cord segments were irradiated for lymph node enlargement prior to BMT, and all the clinicoradiologic findings were consistent with CPRM. We considered possible synergistic toxicity with high-dose busulfan accompanying BMT. Unlike the second case, the first patient had continued severe progression of CPRM, possibly because a higher dose of additional radiotherapy (30 Gy) was given for presumed spinal cord tumor involvement in that case than in the other (< 20 Gy).

The toxicity of quercetin was partly prevented by nontoxic concentrations of other flavonoids examined, thus pointing out to potential neutralization of quercetin cytotoxicity by intake of flavonoid mixtures.","['Dickancaite, E', 'Nemeikaite, A', 'Kalvelyte, A', 'Cenas, N']","['Dickancaite E', 'Nemeikaite A', 'Kalvelyte A', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', ""DD517SCM92 (N,N'-diphenyl-4-phenylenediamine)"", 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Oxidants/*toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phenylenediamines/pharmacology', 'Sheep', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1998/09/18 00:00,1998/09/18 00:01,['1998/09/18 00:00'],"['1998/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1998 Aug;45(5):923-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK).,721-6,"PURPOSE: To study the efficacy and the safety of cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CDA) administered as 24-hour infusions or as subcutaneous bolus injections at two different doses to patients with relapsing or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this non randomised 2-cohort study, 20 patients with pretreated CLL received cladribine at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/cycle as continuous i.v. infusions over seven days (group 1) and 35 patients were treated at a reduced dose of 0.5 mg/kg/cycle given as s.c. bolus injections for five days (group 2). After two cycles of four week duration, response was assessed. In the case of progressive disease, therapy was discontinued, otherwise a maximum of four additional cycles were administered until best response. RESULTS: A total of 130 cycles were administered (group 1: 41, group 2: 89). Patient characteristics in both groups were comparable. The median dose intensities were 0.172 mg/kg per week and 0.123 mg/kg per week for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P < or = 0.0001). The overall response rate for all 55 patients was 38% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 25%-52%), with 5% CR and 33% PR. Response was similar in both patient groups (35% in group 1, 40% in group 2). No association between cladribine dose intensity and response rate was found, and there was no difference between patients relapsing after or refractory to previous therapies (11 of 24 vs. 10 of 31). Median remission duration was six months in both groups. Toxicity, in particular infections (all WHO grades, 34% in group 1 versus 7% in group 2) and myelosuppression (grade 1-4 neutropenia, 72% versus 41% of cladribine cycles) were statistically significantly more frequent in group 1. CONCLUSION: Cladribine is active in heavily pretreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemias. Dose reduction by 29% led to similar response and remission duration, but to a significant decrease of myelotoxicity and risk of infection. Cladribine administered as s.c. bolus injections at 0.5 mg/kg per cycle is safe and this dose level should not be exceeded in this patient population.","['Betticher, D C', 'Ratschiller, D', 'Hsu Schmitz, S F', 'von Rohr, A', 'Hess, U', 'Zulian, G', 'Wernli, M', 'Tichelli, A', 'Tobler, A', 'Fey, M F', 'Cerny, T']","['Betticher DC', 'Ratschiller D', 'Hsu Schmitz SF', 'von Rohr A', 'Hess U', 'Zulian G', 'Wernli M', 'Tichelli A', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF', 'Cerny T']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. daniel.betticher@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Failure']",1998/09/18 00:00,1998/09/18 00:01,['1998/09/18 00:00'],"['1998/09/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008273131598 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55921-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 Jul;9(7):721-6. doi: 10.1023/a:1008273131598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This genetic abnormality is the hallmark of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but is also found in some cases of atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), characterized by a poor outcome. For an unequivocal assessment of this specific chromosomal rearrangement on interphase cells, we developed a set of probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Northern blotting was performed for analysis of the cyclin D1 expression in 18 patients. Thirty-eight patients, with either a typical MCL leukemic phase (17 patients) or atypical CLL with an MCL-type immunophenotype, i.e., CD19-, CD5+, CD23-/low, CD79b/sIgM(D)++, and FMC7+ (21 patients), were analyzed by dual-color interphase FISH. We selected an IGH-specific BAC probe (covering the JH and first constant regions) and a commercially available CCND1 probe. An IGH-CCND1 fusion was detected in 28 of the 38 patients (17 typical MCL and 11 cases with CLL). Cyclin D1 was not overexpressed in two patients with typical MCL and an IGH-CCND1 fusion. In view of the poor prognosis associated with MCL and t(11;14)-positive CLL, we conclude that this set of probes is a valuable and reliable tool for a rapid diagnosis of these entities.","['Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Garand, R', 'Gaillard, F', 'Daviet, A', 'Mellerin, M P', 'Robillard, N', 'Bouyge, I', 'Arcot, S', 'Batzer, M', 'Talmant, P', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Milpied, N', 'Bataille, R']","['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Garand R', 'Gaillard F', 'Daviet A', 'Mellerin MP', 'Robillard N', 'Bouyge I', 'Arcot S', 'Batzer M', 'Talmant P', 'Harousseau JL', 'Milpied N', 'Bataille R']","['Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1998/09/17 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/17 02:03'],"['1998/09/17 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/17 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199810)23:2<175::AID-GCC11>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199810)23:2<175::aid-gcc11>3.0.co;2-n [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Oct;23(2):175-82. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199810)23:2<175::aid-gcc11>3.0.co;2-n.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These methyl adducts are removed from DNA by the O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT). The mechanism by which O6-methylguanine (O6meG) induces cell death in OGAT-deficient cells requires a functional mismatch repair system (MRS). We have previously reported that depletion of OGAT activity in the human T-cell leukemic urkat line does not sensitize these cells to the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the methylating triazene temozolomide (Tentori et al., 1995). We therefore decided to establish whether the tolerance of Jurkat cells to O6meG could be associated with a defect in MRS. The results of mismatch repair complementation studies indicated that Jurkat cells are defective in hMutSalpha, a heterodimer of the hMSH2 and hMSH6 proteins. Cytogenetic analysis of two Jurkat clones revealed a deletion in the short arm of chromosome region 2p15-21, indicating an allelic loss of both hMSH2 and hMSH6 genes. DNA sequencing revealed that exon 13 of the second hMSH2 allele contains a base substitution at codon 711, which changes an arginine to a termination codon (CGA-->TGA). In addition, a (C)8-->(C)7 frameshift mutation in codon 1085-1087 of the hMSH6 gene was also found. Although both hMSH2 and hMSH6 transcripts could be detected in Jurkat clones, the respective polypeptides were absent. Taken together, these data indicate that tolerance of Jurkat cells to methylation damage is linked to a loss of functional hMutSalpha.","['Levati, L', 'Marra, G', 'Lettieri, T', ""D'Atri, S"", 'Vernole, P', 'Tentori, L', 'Lacal, P M', 'Pagani, E', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Jiricny, J', 'Graziani, G']","['Levati L', 'Marra G', 'Lettieri T', ""D'Atri S"", 'Vernole P', 'Tentori L', 'Lacal PM', 'Pagani E', 'Bonmassar E', 'Jiricny J', 'Graziani G']","[""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata (IDI-IRCCS), Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-T mismatch-binding protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['*Base Pair Mismatch', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/17 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/17 02:03'],"['1998/09/17 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/17 02:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199810)23:2<159::AID-GCC9>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Oct;23(2):159-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-color BCR-ABL probes visualizing one fusion signal (1F FISH) have high false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). The FPR is a result of the random spatial association of probe signals within normal interphase cells so that some cells appear to contain the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The FNR of 1F FISH probes depends on the distance between the BCR and ABL probes hybridized to the BCR-ABL fusion gene (< or =368 kb); the ""gap"" between the signals causing the cell to be interpreted as normal. To overcome these difficulties, a two-color probe was used, employing four yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) sequences that span the breakpoint regions of the BCR and ABL genes and that visualize the two fusion signals BCR-ABL and ABL-BCR in CML cells (2F FISH). The FNR for the 2F FISH probes was assessed on clonal Ph+ granulocyte-macrophage-colony-forming cell (CFU-GM) derived colonies and was reduced to 0.4% (2/450), compared with an FNR of 13.5% (111/823) with 1F FISH.

RESULTS: Three of the 8 patients had a reticuloendothelial disease (benign monoclonal gammopathy in 2 and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in 1). These 3 patients had larger cutaneous lesions and involvement of trunk and extremities. Histologic examination showed only foamy macrophages in 2 of the 8 patients. The remainder exhibited macrophages, foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and Touton cells. CONCLUSION: The incidence of underlying disease associated with DPX seems to be lower than expected.

METHODS: Poor-risk solid tumors were treated with four courses of cyclophosphamide (4,200 mg/m2)/ doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), and three courses of ifosfamide (9,000 mg/m2)/etoposide (500 mg/m2). The cumulative incidence of treatment-related myelodysplasia/ leukemia (t-AML) was calculated using the method of competing risks. The expected number of leukemic events was calculated by applying national incidence rates to person-years classified by age and sex. RESULTS: Among 86 patients (median age, 17 years) monitored for 6 to 88 months (median, 24), five cases of t-AML were detected at 10 to 37 months (median, 17). The expected number of leukemic events in this cohort was .001. Clinical and cytogenetic findings implicated prior alkylator therapy in three cases and prior treatment with topoisomerase-II inhibitors in two. At 40 months, the cumulative incidence of t-AML was 8% (SE 7%). CONCLUSION: Repetitive high-dose use of alkylating agents given with topoisomerase-II inhibitors is strongly leukemogenic, even with modest cumulative doses of each drug. This finding is notable for the following reasons: (1) it undermines predictions that limited use of high-dose chemotherapy might be minimally leukemogenic, and (2) it contrasts strikingly with the previously reported low risk of t-AML following treatment of pediatric solid tumors with chemotherapy lacking the alkylator dose-intensity and prominence of etoposide that are hallmarks of current regimens.","['Kushner, B H', 'Heller, G', 'Cheung, N K', 'Wollner, N', 'Kramer, K', 'Bajorin, D', 'Polyak, T', 'Meyers, P A']","['Kushner BH', 'Heller G', 'Cheung NK', 'Wollner N', 'Kramer K', 'Bajorin D', 'Polyak T', 'Meyers PA']","['Department of Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. kushnerb@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/09/17 00:00,1998/09/17 00:01,['1998/09/17 00:00'],"['1998/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.9.3016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Sep;16(9):3016-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.9.3016.,,['CA61017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the effects of externally applied, low-intensity 60 Hz electric (E) fields (0.5 V/m, current density 0.8 A/m2) on the agonist-induced Ca2+ fluxes of HL-60 leukemia cells. The suspensions of HL-60 cells received E-field or sham exposure for 60 min and were simultaneously stimulated either by 1 microM ATP or by 100 microM histamine or were not stimulated at all. After E-field or sham exposure, the responses of the intracellular calcium levels of the cells to different concentrations of ATP (0.2-100 microM) were assessed. Compared with control cells, exposure of ATP-activated cells to an E-field resulted in a 20-30% decrease in the magnitude of [Ca2+]i elevation induced by a low concentration of ATP (<1 microM). In contrast, exposure of histamine-activated HL-60 cells resulted in a 20-40% increase of ATP-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. E-field exposure had no effect on non-activated cells. Kinetic analysis of concentration-response plots also showed that compared with control cells, exposure to the E-field resulted in increases of the Michaelis constant, Km, value in ATP-treated cells and of the maximal [Ca2+]i peak rise in histamine-treated HL-60 cells. The observed effects were reversible, indicating the absence of permanent structural damages induced by acute 60 min exposure to electric fields. These results demonstrate that low-intensity electric fields can alter calcium distribution in cells, most probably due to the effect on receptor-operated Ca2+ and/or ion channels.","['Kim, Y V', 'Conover, D L', 'Lotz, W G', 'Cleary, S F']","['Kim YV', 'Conover DL', 'Lotz WG', 'Cleary SF']","['Division of Biomedical and Behavioral Science, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/radiation effects', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'HL-60 Cells/radiation effects', 'Histamine/pharmacology', 'Humans']",1998/09/17 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/17 02:02'],"['1998/09/17 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/17 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1998)19:6<366::AID-BEM4>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(1998)19:6<366::aid-bem4>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1998;19(6):366-76. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(1998)19:6<366::aid-bem4>3.0.co;2-#.,,"['R01ES054175/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'VOG EMB 272/MB/BHP HRSA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, these investigators found through logistic regression analysis that disease was more strongly associated with calculated historical fields than with distance. Since the calculated historical fields in that study depended predominantly on distance and transmission-line load current, the logistic regression results suggest that historical load current plays an important role in the epidemiological results. Thus, we studied hourly 1974 load-current data for six transmission lines, and we examined 1958-1985 annual load-current data for 112 transmission lines. Most lines exhibited marked diurnal load-current rhythms during 1974, and all six showed systematic weekday-weekend differences. During 1958-1985, average loadings of Swedish 220 and 400 kV lines increased by about 1.3% year. Predictive-value and kappa-statistic analyses indicated that Swedish transmission-line load currents were not stable over long periods, so that contemporaneous load current (or a contemporary magnetic field measurement) was not a good surrogate for historical load current (or historical magnetic fields). The results provide a potential explanation of the failure of the Swedish Study to find an association between leukemia and contemporaneous magnetic field levels measured many years after the etiologic period, and suggest that the inclusion of load-current data could significantly improve the quality of historical field calculations.","['Kaune, W T', 'Feychting, M', 'Ahlbom, A', 'Ulrich, R M', 'Savitz, D A']","['Kaune WT', 'Feychting M', 'Ahlbom A', 'Ulrich RM', 'Savitz DA']","['EM Factors, Richland, Washington 99352, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Circadian Rhythm', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",1998/09/17 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/17 02:02'],"['1998/09/17 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/17 02:02 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1998)19:6<354::AID-BEM3>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1998;19(6):354-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The P6 strain of senescence-accelerated mice (SAM) exhibit an early decrease in bone mass with a reduction in bone remodeling. In the bone marrow, suppressed osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis with enhanced adipogenesis are observed. The present study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism of age-related changes in bone turnover using bone marrow cells from SAMP6 mice. Because interleukin (IL)-11 has been shown to potently inhibit adipogenesis and to stimulate osteoclast formation, the effect of IL-11 on the differentiation of bone marrow cells was examined. The impaired formation of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts was restored and the enhanced formation of adipocytes was suppressed by the addition of 10 pM recombinant human IL-11. Other cytokines that activate gp130 as a common signal transducer, IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, did not have such effects. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of IL-11 cDNA obtained from SAMP6 stromal cells revealed no mutations. Constitutively secreted IL-11 protein into culture media, and its mRNA expression stimulated by transforming growth factor beta were reduced in stromal cells from SAMP6 compared with those in control mice. These results demonstrate that the expression of IL-11 is reduced in bone marrow cells of SAMP6 and suggest that the reduction in IL-11 actions is involved in the impairment of both osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis in these mice. There is a possibility that alterations in IL-11 actions may be associated with the age-related impairment in bone metabolism.","['Kodama, Y', 'Takeuchi, Y', 'Suzawa, M', 'Fukumoto, S', 'Murayama, H', 'Yamato, H', 'Fujita, T', 'Kurokawa, T', 'Matsumoto, T']","['Kodama Y', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Suzawa M', 'Fukumoto S', 'Murayama H', 'Yamato H', 'Fujita T', 'Kurokawa T', 'Matsumoto T']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Aging/metabolism/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Density/physiology', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*etiology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Remodeling/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/physiology', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/physiology']",1998/09/17 00:00,1998/09/17 00:01,['1998/09/17 00:00'],"['1998/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.9.1370 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 Sep;13(9):1370-7. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.9.1370.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost 20% of patients with acute leukemia initially present with symptoms of the oral cavity (ulcerations, gingival hypertrophy, etc.). If a malignant lymphoma is suspected, the lymph node should be removed in toto to ascertain diagnosis. Furthermore, in order to make sure that the immunohistological work-up or electron microscopic analysis is adequate, the pathologist should be informed prior to extirpation of the suspicious lymph node. The same diagnostic procedure is indicated for metastases from undifferentiated or small cell cancer of an unknown primary. Metastatic squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma to a solitary cervical lymph node from an unknown primary can be cured by multimodal therapy (extirpation, radical neck dissection and adjuvant radiation) in 30% of the cases. Following polychemotherapy, long-term survival may also be achieved in disseminated stages of undifferentiated carcinoma or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in an occult primary. When osteosarcoma of the jaw is suspected, core biopsy has to be planned carefully: in order to prevent tumor seeding, the needle track has to be excised during definitive surgery. Most authors propose (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy (or chemoradiation) for head and neck osteosarcoma, especially when additional risk factors, i.e. a large primary or poorly differentiated sarcoma, are present. Patients with positive margins should receive adjuvant radiotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma. Local control of angiosarcoma is possible exclusively by radiation. Adjuvant radiation is also indicated in Merkel cell carcinoma. Because this tumor spreads in a ""cascade"" fashion, elective node dissection may also provide a chance for cure. Excision with wide margins is the principal therapeutic step in malignant melanoma. Due to the anatomic localization, adequate resection may not be possible in mucosal melanoma of the head and neck. When regional lymph nodes are involved, radical lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiation have to be added to the therapeutic concept. There is an emerging role for adjuvant interferon alpha in intermediate and high-risk melanoma.","['Petrasch, S']",['Petrasch S'],"['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Mund Kiefer Gesichtschir,"Mund-, Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie : MKG",9716576,,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/secondary/*therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/therapy', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",1998/09/17 00:00,1998/09/17 00:01,['1998/09/17 00:00'],"['1998/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s100060050055 [doi]'],ppublish,Mund Kiefer Gesichtschir. 1998 Jul;2(4):172-80. doi: 10.1007/s100060050055.,,,,,74,,,,,,,Management hamatologischer Systemerkrankungen und seltener Tumorentitaten bei Manifestation im Mund-Kiefer-Gesichtsbereich.,,,,,,,

HSF2 has been thought to be responsible for accumulation of HSP70 during hemin-induced differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells because of accompanying acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity. However, there has not been any direct evidence for such a functional role of HSF2. The purpose of this study is to clarify the roles of HSF1 and HSF2 in HSP70 induction in hemin-treated K562 cells. We show here that a chimeric polypeptide of HSF2 and GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-BD-HSF2) was unable to induce a GAL4 binding site-containing luciferase reporter gene in response to hemin and that exogenously overproduced HSF2 also failed to increase expression of a heat shock element-containing reporter. On the contrary, expression of a GAL4-BD-HSF1 chimeric protein responded to hemin treatment as well as to heat shock, and transiently overexpressed HSF1 caused hemin-responsive induction of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that HSF1, rather than HSF2, primarily mediates the hemin-induced transcription of the hsp70 gene.","['Yoshima, T', 'Yura, T', 'Yanagi, H']","['Yoshima T', 'Yura T', 'Yanagi H']","['HSP Research Institute, Kyoto Research Park, Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto 600-8813, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Hemin/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/17 00:00,1998/09/17 00:01,['1998/09/17 00:00'],"['1998/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.39.25466 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)60068-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 25;273(39):25466-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.39.25466.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 11671-11673). Human pre-B REH cells express high levels of Bcl2 yet remain sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and Adriamycin. In contrast, myeloid leukemia-derived HL60 cells express less than half the level of Bcl-2 but are >10-fold more resistant to apoptosis induced by these drugs. The mechanism responsible for this apparent dichotomy appears to involve a deficiency of mitochondrial PKCalpha since 1) HL60 but not REH cells contain highly phosphorylated Bcl2; 2) PKCalpha is the only classical isoform co-localized with Bcl2 in HL60 but not REH mitochondrial membranes; 3) the natural product and potent PKC activator bryostatin-1 induces mitochondrial localization of PKCalpha in association with Bcl2 phosphorylation and increased REH cell resistance to drug-induced apoptosis; 4) PKCalpha can directly phosphorylate wild-type but not phosphorylation-negative and loss of function S70A Bcl2 in vitro; 5) stable, forced expression of exogenous PKCalpha induces mitochondrial localization of PKCalpha, increased Bcl2 phosphorylation and a >10-fold increase in resistance to drug-induced cell death; and () PKCalpha-transduced cells remain highly sensitive to staurosporine, a potent PKC inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment of the PKCalpha transformants with bryostatin-1 leads to even higher levels of mitochondrial PKCalpha, Bcl2 phosphorylation, and REH cell survival following chemotherapy. While these findings strongly support a role for PKCalpha as a functional Bcl2 kinase that can enhance cell resistance to antileukemic chemotherapy, they do not exclude the possibility that another Bcl2 kinase(s) may also exist. Collectively, these findings identify a functional role for PKCalpha in Bcl2 phosphorylation and in resistance to chemotherapy and suggest a novel target for antileukemic strategies.","['Ruvolo, P P', 'Deng, X', 'Carr, B K', 'May, W S']","['Ruvolo PP', 'Deng X', 'Carr BK', 'May WS']","['Sealy Center for Oncology and Hematology and the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",1998/09/17 00:00,1998/09/17 00:01,['1998/09/17 00:00'],"['1998/09/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.39.25436 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)60064-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Sep 25;273(39):25436-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.39.25436.,,"['CA44649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, DMS has been shown to inhibit protein kinase C in vitro. Here we report that DMS is a competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase from U937 monoblastic leukemia cells, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. DMS decreases basal levels of SPP and prevents increases in SPP in response to physiological stimuli known to activate sphingosine kinase. DMS also effectively increases cellular levels of ceramide in a variety of cell types, and resetting of the ceramide/SPP rheostat may account for the pro-apoptotic effects of DMS. Moreover, DMS, at concentrations which effectively inhibit sphingosine kinase, has no effect on protein kinase C activity or its membrane translocation. Thus, DMS acts as a specific competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase in diverse cell types and is a useful tool to elucidate the role of SPP as an intracellular second messenger.","['Edsall, L C', 'Van Brocklyn, J R', 'Cuvillier, O', 'Kleuser, B', 'Spiegel, S']","['Edsall LC', 'Van Brocklyn JR', 'Cuvillier O', 'Kleuser B', 'Spiegel S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Mice', 'PC12 Cells', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi980744d [doi]', 'bi980744d [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Sep 15;37(37):12892-8. doi: 10.1021/bi980744d.,,"['CA61774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM43880/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitation of the amount of the fusion transcript during CR may therefore be more predictive of cure or relapse than a simple qualitative assessment. Real Time PCR, a fluorometric-based technique, allows simple and rapid quantitation of a target sequence during the extension phase of PCR amplification, in contrast to end-point quantitative methods. Six patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22) AML, who achieved CR were studied by Real Time RT-PCR at different time intervals following diagnosis and high-dose cytarabine and anthracycline-based induction therapy. Five patients had a diagnostic bone marrow (BM) sample available for molecular analysis. Each patient showed > or = 10(3) copies of the AML1/ETO fusion transcript at diagnosis, and each showed a 2- to 4-log decrease in copy number following successful induction chemotherapy. This is comparable to the log-fold reduction in leukemic blasts that is thought to occur in patients successfully cytoreduced into CR by induction chemotherapy. The sixth patient showed a relatively high copy number immediately following successful remission induction chemotherapy, which continued to increase during early CR and was later followed by relapse. Real Time RT-PCR appears to offer advantages over previously used quantitative RT-PCR methods by providing absolute quantitation of the target sequence, expanding the dynamic range of quantitation to over six orders of magnitude, eliminating the post-PCR processing, and reducing labor and carryover contamination. These features make this an attractive method to prospectively evaluate the prognostic value of AML1/ETO fusion transcript quantitation in a larger patient population with t(8;21)(q22;q22) AML in CR.","['Marcucci, G', 'Livak, K J', 'Bi, W', 'Strout, M P', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Marcucci G', 'Livak KJ', 'Bi W', 'Strout MP', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401128 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1482-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401128.,,"['CA-09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its activity is regulated through association with bcl-2 homologous and nonhomologous proteins and also by serine phosphorylation. We now report that bcl-2 can be proteolytically cleaved towards its N-terminus by a cysteine proteinase present in RL-7 lymphoma cell lysates, yielding a major product of apparent MW 20 kDa, different from the products of bcl-2 cleavage by HIV protease. Moreover, bcl-2 proteins mutated for Asp residues at positions 31 and 34 were efficiently cleaved by RL-7 cell lysates, indicating that this proteolytic activity is distinct from the caspase-3 that cleaves bcl-2 at Asp 34. This bcl-2 cleaving activity is inhibited by E-64 and is therefore distinct from the proteinases of the ICE/Ced-3 family (caspases), whereas reciprocally, ICE (caspase-1) is unable to cleave bcl-2. It is optimally active at pH 5, a feature distinguishing it from calpain, another non-ICE cysteine proteinase which has been associated with apoptosis. This novel bcl-2 cleaving protease, although constitutively present in RL-7 cells and resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) was upregulated following induction of apoptosis in RL-7 cells or mitogen activation in PBL. The N-terminus of bcl-2 which contains the BH4 domain that binds the kinase Raf-1 and the phosphatase calcineurin is essential for anti-apoptotic activity. Its cleavage might provide a novel post-translational mechanism for regulating bcl-2 function and could amplify ongoing programmed cell death.","['Yamamoto, A M', 'Eloy, L', 'Bach, J F', 'Garchon, H J']","['Yamamoto AM', 'Eloy L', 'Bach JF', 'Garchon HJ']","['INSERM U25, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401132 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1467-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following HDCYC 74 patients received hematopoietic growth factors (HGF), either G-CSF (n = 19) or GM-CSF (n = 55). All the patients were subsequently planned to undergo ABPCT. PBPC collection was possible for 106 patients. The most important prognostic factor for collection of more than 25 x 10(4) CFU-GM cells/kg and 2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was the use of HGF (P = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively). Previous use of an alkylating agent, response to treatment before HDCYC, and interval between diagnosis and HDCYC were also significant factors (P = 0.004, 0.025 and 0.001, respectively). The number of CFU-GM cells infused was the most important parameter for rapid and complete hematological recovery after ABPCT (P < 0.0001). Thus the use of HGF post-HDCYC is the major factor which, associated with reduced time between diagnosis and HDCYC and the use of an alkylating agent, could increase the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors collected, and subsequently improve hematopoietic recovery following ABPCT in MM patients.","['Marit, G', 'Thiessard, F', 'Faberes, C', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Boiron, J M', 'Bernard, P', 'Pigneux, A', 'Puntous, M', 'Agape, P', 'Vezon, G', 'Broustet, A', 'Girault, D', 'Salmi, L R', 'Reiffers, J']","['Marit G', 'Thiessard F', 'Faberes C', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Boiron JM', 'Bernard P', 'Pigneux A', 'Puntous M', 'Agape P', 'Vezon G', 'Broustet A', 'Girault D', 'Salmi LR', 'Reiffers J']","['Unite de greffe de moelle osseuse, UMR CNRS 5540, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401105 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1447-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to lower the risk of acute GVHD we used CD34 marrow cell selection for T cell depletion. Since T cell depletion has been linked to an increased risk of relapse and an increased risk of marrow failure, we used PCR amplification of minisatellite sequences to investigate donor cell engraftment and RT-PCR amplification of recurrent chromosomal translocations to investigate the residual disease post-transplant. Twenty-three patients who underwent BMT after positive selection of the CD34-positive cell population were studied. Results were then compared with those of 37 patients who underwent transplantation with unmanipulated marrow graft. Among the 23 patients who received CD34+ selected cell grafts, seven (30%) had evidence of full donor engraftment, 14 had evidence of residual recipient cells (61%), one had a non-take, and one autologous bone marrow recovery. Analysis of the chimaerism status post-transplant in 36 patients who received unmanipulated marrow grafts showed that 31 patients (86%) had evidence of full donor engraftment. The difference in the incidence of mixed chimaerism profile between patients who received unmanipulated marrow graft and those receiving CD34+ selected cell grafts was statistically significant (P< 0.01). Nine patients who received CD34+ selected cell grafts could be analysed for the presence of minimal residual disease post-transplant (one with t(9;22) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and eight with CML). In the patient transplanted for a Ph-positive acute leukaemia, and in two out of the eight patients with CML, the search fora fusion transcript was consistently negative after transplantation. Among the six patients with evidence of residual disease, three patients also had a mixed chimaerism profile and were given donor lymphocyte infusions. Minimal residual disease study was performed post-transplant in 16 patients who received unmanipulated marrow grafts. In 10 of 14 patients with CML, and in two patients with acute leukaemia the search for a fusion transcript was consistently negative after transplantation. The difference in the incidence of minimal residual disease between patients who received an unmanipulated marrow graft and those receiving CD34+ selected cell grafts was not statistically significantly significant, but numbers of patients included in this analysis are still few. In conclusion, our study highlights the strong influence of graft manipulation on the incidence of mixed chimaerism after transplantation from an unrelated donor.","['Socie, G', 'Cayuela, J M', 'Raynal, B', 'Esperou, H', 'Fund, X', 'Raffoux, C', 'Devergie, A', 'Ribaud, P', 'Marolleau, J P', 'Parquet, N', 'Sigaux, F', 'Brison, O', 'Gluckman, E']","['Socie G', 'Cayuela JM', 'Raynal B', 'Esperou H', 'Fund X', 'Raffoux C', 'Devergie A', 'Ribaud P', 'Marolleau JP', 'Parquet N', 'Sigaux F', 'Brison O', 'Gluckman E']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Greffe de Moelle and Unite de Recherche sur la Biologie des Cellules Souches, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401110 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1440-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401110.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, most YJ cells were myeloblastoid with a small number of the cells having eosinophilic granules. Cell surface markers in the YJ cells were positive for CD33 and were negative for CD34, CD16 and CD23. The eosinophilic characteristics of YJ cells were confirmed by histochemical staining with Fast-Green/Neutral-Red and by the expression of mRNAs for eosinophil-associated granule proteins, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), and major basic protein (MBP), and for the Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein. The YJ cells could be induced towards monocytic differentiation by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The monocytic characteristics of YJ cells treated with PMA were confirmed by morphological analysis with alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining, by CD14 expression, and by increased expression of Egr-1 mRNA. Furthermore, YJ cells could be differentiated towards the neutrophil lineage by stimulation with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). YJ cells treated in vitro with 2 microM RA differentiated into metamyelocytes and band neutrophils, and increased the number of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells and increased gp91phox mRNA expression. Thus, the YJ cell line exhibited eosinophilic characteristics, but was able to differentiate to the monocytic or neutrophilic lineages in response to PMA or RA, respectively. The expression of genes for transcription factors involved in myeloid differentiation was evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Increased expression of Egr-1 was observed with macrophage differentiation. In contrast, increased expressions of C/EBPbeta and MZF-1 mRNA occurred with neutrophilic differentiation. The YJ cell line should be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing lineage switching from the eosinophil to monocytic or neutrophil lineages.","['Yamaguchi, Y', 'Nishio, H', 'Kasahara, T', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Koyanagi, H', 'Suda, T']","['Yamaguchi Y', 'Nishio H', 'Kasahara T', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Koyanagi H', 'Suda T']","['Department of Cell Differentiation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Eosinophils/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*pathology']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401115 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1430-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401115.,,"['AI 25230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 33043/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Luciferase reporter assay in NIH3T3 cells showed that the expression vector encoding Myb(TK-6) stimulated Myb-regulated mim-1 promoter more effectively than that encoding wild-type human c-Myb, suggesting that Myb(TK-6) is functional as a transcription factor, and thus as a potential transforming protein.

However, little is known about the potential association between p16/p15 gene alterations and specific genetic abnormalities implicated in leukemogenesis. The t(1;19)(q23;p13) and t(17;19)(q21-22;p13) are non-random translocations observed in childhood ALL that create distinct E2A fusion proteins: E2A-PBX1 and E2A-HLF, respectively. Previously, a negative association was found between the t(1;19) and homozygous p16/p15 deletions. In this study we determined p16 and p15 gene status in additional t(1;19)+ ALLs and compared this incidence to that observed in t(17;19)+ ALLs. No homozygous p16 or p15 deletions were observed among 13 t(1;19)+ ALLs analyzed. In contrast, homozygous deletions of both p16 and p15 were present in two of four t(17;19)+ ALLs. None of 10 t(1;19)+ ALLs contained p15 promoter hypermethylation. In contrast, one of the two t(17;19)+ ALLs that lacked p15/p16 homozygous deletions showed probable hemizygous p15 hypermethylation. We conclude that homozygous p16 and/or p15 deletions and p15 hypermethylation rarely accompany E2A-PBX1 fusion, but occur in concert with E2A-HLF fusion in a subset of t(17;19)+ ALLs. These findings suggest that there may be different modes of cooperative leukemogenesis in ALLs associated with different E2A fusion proteins.","['Maloney, K W', 'McGavran, L', 'Odom, L F', 'Hunger, S P']","['Maloney KW', 'McGavran L', 'Odom LF', 'Hunger SP']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, The Children's Hospital, Denver, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401124 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1417-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401124.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although JT occasionally are constitutional, most are associated with hematologic malignancies. In such cases, JT usually arise during disease progression and are associated with poor prognosis. Despite its clinical importance, this cytogenetic phenomenon has not been characterized at the molecular level. We have analyzed JT in a juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukemia that subsequently transformed to an acute myeloid leukemia. Detailed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses showed that the cytogenetically identical donor breakpoint at 3q21 was highly heterogeneous. In fact, more than 10 distinct breakpoints, four of which mapped within YACs, were identified. Analyses of samples during disease progression showed that the breakpoint complexity decreased, indicating clonal selection. Hence, the 3q21 breakpoints displayed a spatial as well as a temporal heterogeneity, revealing that JT are highly unstable, showing great variation in the size of donor segment. The breaks at the recipient chromosomes were mapped within the subtelomeric regions. The general telomere length was not affected and an underlying replication error resulting in microsatellite instability was excluded. We conclude that the emergence of JT is unlikely to cause fusion genes or to affect the expression of genes located in the breakpoint regions. The identification of YACs spanning the breakpoints, ie, YACs 913c7, 937g5, 948c2 and 955g1, may facilitate the isolation of DNA sequences leading to a genetic instability associated with the origin of multiple translocations.","['Andreasson, P', 'Hoglund, M', 'Jonson, T', 'Bekassy, A', 'Mitelman, F', 'Johansson, B']","['Andreasson P', 'Hoglund M', 'Jonson T', 'Bekassy A', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401108 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1411-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In U937, a cell line established from a diffuse histiocytic lymphoma, a t(10;11)(p13;q14-21) fuses AF10 to CALM. AF10 is also fused to MLL by a translocation that appears quite similar at the cytogenetic level, the t(10;11)(p12;q23). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies have demonstrated that AF10 and CALM are also involved in other hematological malignancies containing t(10;11)(p13;q21), but no data are available concerning the molecular details of AF10-CALM fusion in primary leukemias.

The majority of the AF10 and AF10-CALM cDNA isoforms that we identified are predicted to encode for truncated AF10 polypeptides, raising the possibility that these might have important cellular functions in normal and malignant cells, perhaps by acting as dominant negative inhibitors of full-length AF10 or related proteins.","['Silliman, C C', 'McGavran, L', 'Wei, Q', 'Miller, L A', 'Li, S', 'Hunger, S P']","['Silliman CC', 'McGavran L', 'Wei Q', 'Miller LA', 'Li S', 'Hunger SP']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, The Children's Hospital, Denver, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Adolescent', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemistry/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401109 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1404-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401109.,"['GENBANK/AF060927', 'GENBANK/AF060928', 'GENBANK/AF060929', 'GENBANK/AF060930', 'GENBANK/AF060931', 'GENBANK/AF060932', 'GENBANK/AF060933', 'GENBANK/AF060934', 'GENBANK/AF060935', 'GENBANK/AF060936', 'GENBANK/AF060937', 'GENBANK/AF060938', 'GENBANK/AF060939', 'GENBANK/AF060940']",['MO1-RR00069/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the presence and frequency of the MLL/AF-4 rearrangement in normal cord blood. Although no chimeric mRNA of MLL or AF-4 was detected in 65 cord blood samples, in-frame fusion transcripts of exon 11 and exon 4 or 5 of the AF-4 gene were detected in three of the samples by a nested polymerase chain reaction. When primers of exon 11 and exon 5 of the AF-4 gene were used, two forms of fusion transcripts (AF-4 exon 11/4 or exon 11/5) were detected in 20 of the 65 cord blood samples (31%) and also four of six leukemic cell samples with t(4;11) (67%), whereas such transcripts were not observed in any of 21 peripheral blood samples nor in fetal fibroblasts. These findings suggest that the in-frame fusion of exon 11 and exon 4 or 5 of the AF-4 gene frequently occurs in hematopoietic cells during the intrauterine period, even in a healthy fetus.

By multi-color flow cytometric analysis using monoclonal antibody (mAb), APO2.7, which detects mitochondrial 7A6 antigen specifically expressed by cells undergoing apoptosis, we further investigated the apoptosis-inducing effect of VK2 on minor populations of leukemic blast cells in bone marrow from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and overt myeloid leukemia (post-MDS AML). Limiting dilution of CD95 (anti-Fas) mAb-treated apoptotic Jurkat cells with nonapoptotic CTB-1 cells revealed that APO2.7-positive Jurkat cells were consistently detectable by flow cytometry when present at levels of at least 5% in the CTB-1 suspension. In patient samples the gating area for leukemic clone was determined using cell surface antigen-specific mAbs conjugated with either fluorescein isothionate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE) and subsequently the cells stained with phycoerythrin cyanine (PE-Cy5)-conjugated APO2.7 mAb were assessed within the gating area of the leukemic clone for monitoring apoptosis. Treatment of the bone marrow mononuclear cells with 3-10 microM of VK2 (menaquinone-3, -4 and -5) in vitro potently induced apoptosis of the leukemic blast cells as compared with the untreated control cells in all 15 MDS patients tested. This effect was more prominent on blastic cells than that on mature myeloid cells such as CD34-/CD33+ gated cells. In addition, VK2 performed much less effectively on CD3-positive lymphoid cells. In contrast to VK2, VK1 did not show apoptosis-inducing activity. These data suggest that VK2 may be used for treatment of patients with MDS in blastic transformation.","['Yaguchi, M', 'Miyazawa, K', 'Otawa, M', 'Katagiri, T', 'Nishimaki, J', 'Uchida, Y', 'Iwase, O', 'Gotoh, A', 'Kawanishi, Y', 'Toyama, K']","['Yaguchi M', 'Miyazawa K', 'Otawa M', 'Katagiri T', 'Nishimaki J', 'Uchida Y', 'Iwase O', 'Gotoh A', 'Kawanishi Y', 'Toyama K']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (antigen 7A6)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Vitamin K/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401143 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1392-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As2O3 reportedly has dose-dependent dual effects on APL cells, triggering apoptosis at relatively high concentrations and inducing differentiation at lower concentrations. However, its effect is still controversial for other AML cells and hematological neoplasms. We studied the in vitro effect of As2O3 on lymphoid lineage cells: lymphoma cell lines, NOL-3, Raji and Daudi, a myeloma cell line, NOP-1, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and compared it with the effect on APL cell line, NB4, as well as other myeloid cell lines, HL-60 and NKM-1. As2O3 at a concentration of 1 micromol/l markedly inhibited both proliferation and viability of NB4, NOP-1, NOL-3 and NKM-1 cells, but it reduced only viability in normal PBL, CLL cells and NHL cells. As2O3 induced apoptosis and down-regulated bcl-2 expression in NB4, NOP-1 and NKM-1 cells. On the other hand, in HL-60, Raji and Daudi cells, 1 micromol/l As2O3 inhibited only the proliferation weakly, and neither induced apoptosis nor down-regulated bcl-2 expression, but arrested only cell cycle at G1 phase. As2O3 at a low concentration of 0.1 micromol/l had no effect on proliferation and viability of these cells except for NB4. These results showed that As2O3 exerted variable and definite effects on lymphoid cells and indicated that As2O3 might be clinically useful in lymphoid neoplasms such as malignant lymphoma and CLL.","['Zhang, W', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Shigeno, K', 'Fujisawa, S', 'Naito, K', 'Nakamura, S', 'Takeshita, K', 'Takeshita, A', 'Ohno, R']","['Zhang W', 'Ohnishi K', 'Shigeno K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Naito K', 'Nakamura S', 'Takeshita K', 'Takeshita A', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*drug effects', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401112 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1383-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased adhesion occurs within 5 min, is dose dependent, and persists beyond 2 h. Baseline and enhanced adhesion occur through the surface FN receptor very late antigen-5 (VLA-5, CD49e/CD29) which is expressed by AML cells. Unstimulated AML cells exposed to FN undergo less apoptosis than controls (inhibition 22.5 +/- 7.0%, P = 0.02, n = 8). Exposure to SCF alone without FN also inhibits AML cell apoptosis (by 19.0 +/- 7.7% compared to controls, P = 0.06, n = 8). Simultaneous exposure to SCF and FN increases the inhibition of AML cell apoptosis to 37.8 +/- 7.9% (P = 0.005 compared to control, P = 0.04 compared to FN alone, P = 0.06 compared to SCF alone) demonstrating that SCF not only enhances the propensity of AML cells to adhere to FN, but also results in an additive survival benefit following FN contact. Some but not all the reduction in apoptosis is mediated through VLA-5. The combination of SCF and FN also affects proliferation, resulting in a synergistic enhancement of AML cell proliferation in half the cases studied. When normal CD34+ human haemopoietic progenitors were studied, FN had little effect on their apoptosis and failed to enhance the anti-apoptotic effect of SCF. It did, however, synergise with SCF in promoting CD34+ cell proliferation. Exposure of AML cells to SCF and FN, both of which can be found in high concentration in the bone marrow stroma, inhibits apoptosis. Cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins augment each others' effects since SCF enhances adhesion to fibronectin, which in turn augments the survival signal delivered by the cytokine alone. Cytokine and adhesion receptors can combine to affect cell characteristics including proliferation and survival.","['Bendall, L J', 'Makrynikola, V', 'Hutchinson, A', 'Bianchi, A C', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Bendall LJ', 'Makrynikola V', 'Hutchinson A', 'Bianchi AC', 'Bradstock KF', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Department of Haematology, University of Sydney at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401136 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1375-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401136.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore compared multiple assays, including RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and flow cytometry (FC), in 10 cell lines and in 47 fresh and thawed AML cells in order to validate and to quantitate measures for LRP phenotype detection. We also compared different ways of expressing the results. Lastly, in cell lines, we analyzed the 50% lethal concentration (LC50), by MTT assay, of cisplatin which could estimate the functionality of LRP. The reproducibility of LRP detection measured by RT-PCR, ICC and FC was good. In the same way, within the same technique, there was good correlation between the different methods of expressing the results of LRP level. Therefore, the discrepancies noted with the three techniques used were neither a problem of reproducibility nor a problem of results expression. On the other hand, there was only a correlation between ICC and FC, and no correlation between RT-PCR and LRP protein detection techniques. Therefore, RT-PCR is probably not the optimal technique for LRP detection. We have shown in 10 cell lines a higher correlation between FC and LC50 of cisplatin than between ICC and LC50 of cisplatin and no correlation between RT-PCR and LC50 of cisplatin. For five patients, there was a dissociation between ICC and FC. Four patients were positive by FC and negative by ICC and only one patient was negative by FC and positive by ICC. Therefore, if in vitro resistance to cisplatin represents the functionality of LRP, we recommend the use of FC rather than ICC to detect LRP expression. Besides the measurement of LRP as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of resistance to chemotherapy in patients with AML, we urgently need to establish a functional test in order to assess LRP activity.","['Legrand, O', 'Simonin, G', 'Zittoun, R', 'Marie, J P']","['Legrand O', 'Simonin G', 'Zittoun R', 'Marie JP']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Universite Paris 6, Formation de Recherche Associee Claude Bernard sur le Traitement des Hemopathies Malignes, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401117 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1367-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular and cellular mechanisms of the TPO-induced MK differentiation are not totally understood. In order to develop cellular models to study these mechanisms, we introduced c-mpl into UT-7 and TF-1 cells by means of a retroviral vector and compared the effects of TPO on these two cell lines. UT-7 and TF-1 cell lines are two factor-dependent leukemic cell lines with an erythroid and MK phenotype. They proliferate in response to IL-3, GM-CSF and EPO, but not to TPO. The erythroid differentiation of both cell lines can be markedly increased by EPO. Several UT-7/c-mpl and TF-1/c-mpl cell clones which express different levels of the c-mpl protein (Mpl) were obtained and all became TPO-dependent for their proliferation. The UT-7/c-mpl clones, but not the TF-1/c-mpl clones, were capable of undergoing MK differentiation in response to TPO. This was demonstrated by the increase in MK markers (GPIIb, GPIIIa, GPIb alpha, GPIX and vWF), the appearance of cytoplasmic alpha-granules, intracellular membranes resembling demarcation membranes which were immunologically labeled with an GPIIb/IIIa anti-antibody, and a small percentage of polyploid cells (8N and 16N). In contrast, TPO inhibited the erythroid program of differentiation (glycophorin A, beta-globin and EPO receptor) as well as the differentiative activity of EPO in both UT-7/c-mpl and TF-1/c-mpl clones. It is noteworthy that the differentiative effect of EPO in TF-1/c-mpl cells was associated with an increase in GATA-1 transcripts which was totally suppressed by TPO. Overall the effects of TPO are the same as those of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) which also induces MK differentiation and inhibits erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that: (1) Mpl expression is necessary but not sufficient for induction of MK differentiation; and (2) induction of Mk differentiation and inhibition of erythroid differentiation by TPO involve different signaling pathways; the pathway involved in the inhibition of erythroid differentiation might be related to a downregulation of GATA-1 expression in TF-1 cells.","['Goncalves, F', 'Lacout, C', 'Feger, F', 'Cohen-Solal, K', 'Guichard, J', 'Cramer, E', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Dumenil, D']","['Goncalves F', 'Lacout C', 'Feger F', 'Cohen-Solal K', 'Guichard J', 'Cramer E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Dumenil D']","['INSERM U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Laboratoire Hematopoiese et Cellules Souches, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '151472-24-1 (GPA protein, Pneumocystis carinii sp.)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fungal Proteins/analysis', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Gentamicins/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/analysis', 'Ploidies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401122 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1355-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to determine the resistance profile of infant ALL cells. In vitro drug resistance was determined by the MTT assay of 395 children with ALL at initial diagnosis: there were 21 infants <1.5 years of which nine <1 year, 284 children aged 1.5-10 years (intermediate age group) and 90 children >10 years. Immunophenotyping resulted in 310 cALL/preB ALL, 69 T-ALL, 15 proB ALL and one unknown cases. The following drugs were tested: daunorubicin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, idarubicin (Ida), prednisolone (Pred), dexamethasone (DXM), vincristine (VCR), Asparaginase (Asp), 6-MP, 6-TG, AraC, VM26 and 4-HOO-ifosfamide (Ifos). Infants <1.5 years were significantly more resistant to Pred (>500-fold), Asp (11-fold) and VM26 (2.7-fold) but significantly more sensitive to Ara-C (2.3-fold) compared to the intermediate age group. When analyzing infants <1 year of age similar results were found. ProB ALL cells (seven infants <1.5 years; eight children >1.5 years) were significantly more resistant to glucocorticoids, Asp, thiopurines, anthracyclines and Ifos compared to cALL/preB ALL but more sensitive to Ara-C. Cells from children >10 years were significantly more resistant to Pred, DXM, Asp, Ida and 6-MP. T-ALL cells showed a strong resistance to Pred, Asp and VCR and a mild but significant resistance to all other drugs except thiopurines and VM26. We conclude that the poor prognosis of infant ALL is associated with a resistance to glucocorticoids and Asp. However, ALL cells from infants show a relatively high sensitivity to Ara-C which suggests that infants with ALL might benefit from treatment schedules that incorporate more Ara-C than the current treatment protocols.","['Pieters, R', 'den Boer, M L', 'Durian, M', 'Janka, G', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Kaspers, G J', 'van Wering, E R', 'Veerman, A J']","['Pieters R', 'den Boer ML', 'Durian M', 'Janka G', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Kaspers GJ', 'van Wering ER', 'Veerman AJ']","['University Hospital VU, Dept of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/pharmacology']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401129 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1344-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401129.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-six patients and 148 courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy were analysed in the control group as well as 47 patients and 112 treatment courses in the intervention group. Antifungal prophylaxis led to a significant decrease of mortality from invasive fungal infections (8.8%-0.9%, P = 0.005). The median trough concentration of itraconazole of all measurements was 520 ng/ml (range 230-793) in patients who received 400 mg/day and 760 ng/ml (370-1200) in patients receiving a dosage of 600 mg/day (P = 0.002).

Our serial studies on 51 samples with the FLT3 gene mutation indicated that the ITD was frequently (47/51) clustered in the tyrosine-rich stretch from codon 589 to 599 and rarely (3/51) in its downstream region, both of which are located within the juxtamembrane (JM) domain. One remaining sample had an insertion into the JM domain of nucleotides of unknown origin. To elucidate the biological relevance of the ITD or the insertion, we expressed various types of mutant FLT3 in Cos 7 cells. All mutant FLT3 studied were ligand-independently dimerized and their tyrosine residues were phosphorylated. The Y589 of FLT3 was essential for the phosphorylation in the wild FLT3, but a Y589F conversion did not affect the phosphorylation status of the mutant FLT3. These findings suggest that the elongation of the JM domain rather than increase of tyrosine residues causes gain-of-function of FLT3. Thus, ITD is a novel modality of somatic mutation which activates its product. Since the DNA corresponding to codon 593 to 602 potentially forms a palindromic intermediate, we propose that a DNA-replication error might be associated with generating the ITD of the FLT3 gene.","['Kiyoi, H', 'Towatari, M', 'Yokota, S', 'Hamaguchi, M', 'Ohno, R', 'Saito, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Kiyoi H', 'Towatari M', 'Yokota S', 'Hamaguchi M', 'Ohno R', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'COS Cells/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401130 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Sep;12(9):1333-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401130.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous and systemic variants exist. Systemic mastocytosis may show an indolent or malignant clinical course. In malignant mastocytosis (MM), the diagnosis often is missed because the MCs are morphologically abnormal and lack metachromatic granules or the underlying histologic picture is complex. The cytoplasmic serine protease tryptase is produced by MCs and is thought to be expressed at all stages of MC maturation. To assess the diagnostic value of tryptase staining in mastocytosis, tissue sections from 93 patients with mastocytosis, including MM (n = 37), systemic indolent mastocytosis (n = 47), urticaria pigmentosa (n = 5), MC leukemia (n = 2), and solitary skin mastocytoma (n = 2) were stained with the antitryptase antibody G3. The results were compared with those of Giemsa and chloroacetate esterase (CAE) staining. Using antitryptase antibody G3, MC infiltrates were identified in all patients examined, including those with MM (37 of 37), and virtually all the neoplastic MCs (> 95%) appeared to react with G3. In MM, significantly fewer MCs were positive in Giemsa (54.5%; p < 0.05) and CAE (78.8%; p < 0.05). Moreover, G3 produced clear diagnostic staining in all cases of MM, but the proportion of cases with clear diagnostic results (> 10% of neoplastic cells positive) was considerably lower with Giemsa (48.6%; p < 0.05) and CAE (75.7%; p < 0.05) staining. By contrast, tryptase, Giemsa, and CAE produced diagnostic staining of MCs in virtually all cases of systemic indolent mastocytosis, urticaria pigmentosa, and solitary skin mastocytoma. In systemic mastocytosis, survival was significantly reduced in cases with Giemsa-/tryptase+ or CAE-/tryptase+ tumor cells compared to those cases with Giemsa+ or CAE+ MC infiltrates (p < 0.001).","['Horny, H P', 'Sillaber, C', 'Menke, D', 'Kaiserling, E', 'Wehrmann, M', 'Stehberger, B', 'Chott, A', 'Lechner, K', 'Lennert, K', 'Valent, P']","['Horny HP', 'Sillaber C', 'Menke D', 'Kaiserling E', 'Wehrmann M', 'Stehberger B', 'Chott A', 'Lechner K', 'Lennert K', 'Valent P']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Chymases', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis', 'Tryptases']",1998/09/16 00:00,1998/09/16 00:01,['1998/09/16 00:00'],"['1998/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199809000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1998 Sep;22(9):1132-40. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199809000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that all of the human TEL/JAK2 variants, and a human/mouse chimeric hTEL/mJAK2(JH1) fusion gene, transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 to IL-3-independent growth. Transformation requires both the TEL PNT domain and JAK2 kinase activity. Furthermore, all TEL/JAK2 variants strongly activated STAT 5 by phosphotyrosine Western blots and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Mice (n = 40) transplanted with bone marrow infected with the MSCV retrovirus containing either the hTEL/mJAK2(JH1) fusion or its human counterpart developed a fatal mixed myeloproliferative and T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with a latency of 2-10 weeks. In contrast, mice transplanted with a TEL/JAK2 mutant lacking the TEL PNT domain (n = 10) or a kinase-inactive TEL/JAK2(JH1) mutant (n = 10) did not develop the disease.

The ALK gene products were identified in paraffm sections by using a new anti-ALK (cytoplasmic portion) monoclonal antibody (ALKc) that tends to react more strongly than a previously described ALK1 antibody with the nuclei of ALK-expressing tumor cells after microwave heating in 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer, pH 8.0. The ALKc monoclonal antibody reacted selectively with 60% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases (60 of 100), which occurred mainly in the first three decades of life and consistently displayed a T/null phenotype. This group of ALK-positive tumors showed a wide morphological spectrum including cases with features of anaplastic large cell lymphoma ""common"" type (75%), ""lymphohistiocytic"" (10%), ""small cell"" (8.3%), ""giant cell"" (3.3%), and ""Hodgkin's like"" (3.3%). CD30-positive large anaplastic cells expressing the ALK protein both in the cytoplasm and nucleus represented the dominant tumor population in the common, Hodgkin's-like and giant cell types, but they were present at a smaller percentage (often with a perivascular distribution) also in cases with lymphohistiocytic and small cell features. In this study, the ALKc antibody also allowed us to identify small neoplastic cells (usually CD30 negative) with nucleus-restricted ALK positivity that were, by definition, more evident in the small cell variant but were also found in cases with lymphohistiocytic, common, and ""Hodgkin's-like"" features. These findings, which have not been previously emphasized, strongly suggest that the neoplastic lesion (the NPM-ALK gene) must be present both in the large anaplastic and small tumor cells, and that ALK-positive lymphomas lie on a spectrum, their position being defined by the ratio of small to large neoplastic cells. Notably, about 15% of all ALK-positive lymphomas (usually of the common or giant cell variant) showed a cytoplasm-restricted ALK positivity, which suggests that the ALK gene may have fused with a partner(s) other than NPM. From a diagnostic point of view, detection of the ALK protein was useful in distinguishing anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases of lymphohistiocytic and small cell variants from reactive conditions and other peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes, as well as for detecting a small number of tumor cells in lymphohemopoietic tissues. In conclusion, ALK positivity appears to define a clinicopathological entity with a T/null phenotype (""ALK lymphomas""), but one that shows a wider spectrum of morphological patterns than has been appreciated in the past.","['Falini, B', 'Bigerna, B', 'Fizzotti, M', 'Pulford, K', 'Pileri, S A', 'Delsol, G', 'Carbone, A', 'Paulli, M', 'Magrini, U', 'Menestrina, F', 'Giardini, R', 'Pilotti, S', 'Mezzelani, A', 'Ugolini, B', 'Billi, M', 'Pucciarini, A', 'Pacini, R', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Flenghi, L']","['Falini B', 'Bigerna B', 'Fizzotti M', 'Pulford K', 'Pileri SA', 'Delsol G', 'Carbone A', 'Paulli M', 'Magrini U', 'Menestrina F', 'Giardini R', 'Pilotti S', 'Mezzelani A', 'Ugolini B', 'Billi M', 'Pucciarini A', 'Pacini R', 'Pelicci PG', 'Flenghi L']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HeLa Cells/enzymology', 'Hematopoietic System/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/enzymology/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism']",1998/09/15 00:00,1998/09/15 00:01,['1998/09/15 00:00'],"['1998/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)65629-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65629-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1998 Sep;153(3):875-86. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65629-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC1853018,,,,

This was done to determine whether hGFP could function as a marker gene in a retroviral vector and to investigate the expression of genes in a retroviral vector. Surprisingly, clonal vector packaging cell lines showed variable levels of hGFP expression, and expression was detected in as few as 49% of the cells in a clonally derived culture. This indicated that hGFP expression was silenced in individual cells. This silencing could be diminished by selective culturing of the vector packaging cells with the neomycin analog G418 and was reduced by a 3-day treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. The 5-azacytidine effect was transient, and hGFP expression in the vector packaging cells returned to untreated control levels within 2 weeks. Using flow cytometric analysis, hGFP expression was detected in up to 15% of transduced MT4 cells (a CD4+ lymphocytic cell line) after coculturing with packaging cells for 4 days. A 3-day postcoculture treatment with 5-azacytidine was shown to increase the hGFP-expressing MT4 cells from either 10.4% to 11.6% or 3.7% to 4.8%, corresponding to an increase in observed transduction efficiencies of 12% and 30%, respectively. These results indicate that silencing of gene expression from a retroviral vector may result from DNA methylation and occurs rapidly after transduction.","['Gram, G J', 'Nielsen, S D', 'Hansen, J E']","['Gram GJ', 'Nielsen SD', 'Hansen JE']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1998/09/15 00:00,1998/09/15 00:01,['1998/09/15 00:00'],"['1998/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1998 Aug;7(4):333-41. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1998.7.333.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BM and PBSC, but not UCBC, did not form cellular clusters in culture. More cytotoxic granules were present in the cytoplasm of UCBC than PBSC following activation in vitro. Ex vivo manipulation of UCBC with cytokines produced more cytotoxicity to K562 and Raji tumor cells than PBSC or BM (p<0.001). Most cytotoxic cells in UCBC cultures were T lymphocytes, and a correlation existed between the number of CD56+ cells and cytotoxicity levels, particularly after in vitro activation with interleukin-2. No significant difference in adhesion molecule expression was noted among UCBC, PBSC and BM cells. However, there was a significantly decreased expression of CD54 molecules (ICAM) on UCBC compared to PBSC (p<0.05).

However, the DNA binding properties of the NC protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) has not been extensively studied. In this work we characterize the DNA binding ability of the zinc-bound and zinc-free forms of the p15 NC of HTLV-I. We found that only the zinc-bound form of the p15 NC binds single-stranded and double-stranded DNA fragments, but both forms of the p15 NC protein bind and unwind supercoiled DNA. The unwinding activity of the zinc-bound form was 3-fold higher than that observed with the zinc-free form of the protein. Interestingly, eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase antagonists inhibited this unwinding activity. In addition, we showed the formation of NC protein-DNA cleavable complex, which is the result of a presumably covalent bond formed between the protein and the phosphate moiety of the DNA backbone. Moreover, the presence of the p15 NC in the reverse transcription assay significantly increased the activity of the HTLV-I reverse transcriptase.

This property has been exploited in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to analyze cellular DNA damage and repair after exposure to damaging agents. Such methods have not been applied previously to detect nucleoside analog incorporation into cellular DNA. 2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CldAdo), a deoxyadenosine analog, is clinically effective for hairy cell leukemia. CldAdo is taken up by cells, converted to the triphosphate, and incorporated into cellular DNA. Here, we measured by primer extension the ability of CldAMP residues in 98-base single-stranded DNA to block Taq elongation. In contrast to control DNA, no full-length 98-mers were produced on CldAMP-containing templates, and Taq polymerase was halted at the first CldAMP site. We then examined the possibility of using quantitative PCR to measure CldATP incorporation into the N-ras gene after incubation of cultured human leukemia cells with CldAdo or with cisplatin as a positive control for DNA damage. Treatment with either drug resulted in reduced amounts of amplified DNA product compared to untreated cells. CldAMP residues within cellular DNA inhibited PCR amplification in a dose-dependent manner; 100 nM CldAdo produced approximately 0.4 CldAMP sites within a 523-bp region of the N-ras sequence. Thus, PCR analysis with Taq polymerase provides a sensitive assessment of nucleoside analog incorporation after cellular exposure to antileukemic drugs.","['Yuh, S H', 'Tibudan, M', 'Hentosh, P']","['Yuh SH', 'Tibudan M', 'Hentosh P']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, Chicago Medical School, 3333 Green Bay Road, North Chicago, Illinois, 60064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Taq Polymerase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/15 00:00,1998/09/15 00:01,['1998/09/15 00:00'],"['1998/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(98)92782-8 [pii]', '10.1006/abio.1998.2782 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1998 Aug 15;262(1):1-8. doi: 10.1006/abio.1998.2782.,,['CA55414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

In chronic illnesses such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), management typically focuses on control of the disease and its symptoms. Yet an equally important consideration is maintaining the patient's QOL. Much research remains to be done on the subject of QOL in the MDS population. MDS patients have unique problems that can affect QOL: they tend to be elderly and to have comorbid conditions; they develop complications resulting from cytopenias such as infection and bleeding; they experience fatigue; they run the risk of converting to a form of acute leukemia typically resistant to therapy; and they face uncertainty. This paper will address the above problems using a conceptual approach to QOL that has been useful for patients with cancer and various chronic illnesses. The approach, based on the work of Ferrell and Cella, concentrates on five areas of the patient's life: the physical, functional, emotional, social, and spiritual. Actual testing of this conceptual framework in the MDS patient population has begun. Here methods of systematically testing and assessing QOL are discussed in order to help clinicians meet the primary purpose of therapy in the setting of chronic illness: improving or preserving the individual's QOL.","['Thomas, M L']",['Thomas ML'],"['Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Aging/psychology', 'Fatigue/etiology/psychology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', '*Social Support']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00055-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 May;22 Suppl 1:S41-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00055-1.,,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, based on the percentage of bone marrow blasts, the number of cytopenic cell lines and cytogenetics, clinical risk groups have been defined more precisely. Recent studies applying intensive acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-type therapy to high-risk MDS have produced remissions ranging from 45 to 79%. Advances in the understanding of the biology of MDS clearly point to cytogenetics rather than morphologic subtype as being of prognostic relevance. Hence, new treatments need to be developed for patients with unfavorable karyotypes and complex abnormalities in particular. These MDS subtypes are characterized by low spontaneous proliferative activity and low autocrine production of hematopoietic growth factors. The subtypes are, however, highly sensitive to external stimulation by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). New therapies could emerge from these findings, for example, priming high-risk MDS patients with hematopoietic growth factors in combination with intensive AML-type treatment. Recent studies suggest that incorporating high-dose AraC into an intensive drug combination could further improve the outcome of high-risk MDS.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Jahns-Streubel, G', 'Verbeek, W', 'Wormann, B', 'Haase, D', 'Schoch, C']","['Hiddemann W', 'Jahns-Streubel G', 'Verbeek W', 'Wormann B', 'Haase D', 'Schoch C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Georg-August-University, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Critical Care', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00037-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 May;22 Suppl 1:S23-6. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00037-x.,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other than bone marrow transplantation, no treatment has been able to alter the natural history of MDS. As a result, there has been an interest in identifying new and more effective chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the drugs that have been evaluated in an attempt to increase remissions and prolong survival were selected because of their activity in acute myeloid leukemia. Thus cytarabine has been the most widely studied drug. Although numerous studies suggested activity for low-dose cytarabine (LoDAC), a careful analysis of the data identified a complete remission (CR) rate of less than 20%, without meaningful clinical benefit. The issue of LoDAC was finally put to rest by a randomized trial in which survival was no better than with supportive care. 5-Azacytidine induces cellular differentiation by hypomethylation of DNA. Phase II trials noted CRs in fewer than 10% of patients, with response rates under 30%, although additional patients appeared to experience hematologic and clinical benefit. A randomized trial of 5-azacytidine versus supportive care failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. One of the most promising new agents is the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan, which achieves CRs in more than 30% of patients. Combinations of this drug with other active agents are in development. Obviously, new treatment strategies are needed to improve the outcome of MDS patients. Combination approaches incorporating new, active agents should have sound scientific rationale, targeting biological differences among the various MDS subtypes.","['Cheson, B D']",['Cheson BD'],"['Medicine Section, Clinical Investigations Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Harringtonines/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Topotecan/therapeutic use']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00039-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 May;22 Suppl 1:S17-21. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00039-3.,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the development of a consensual, prognostic, risk-based analysis system generated by the International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop. In the workshop, cytogenetic, morphological, and clinical data were combined and collated from a relatively large group of patients with primary MDS. Critical prognostic variables were evaluated using the data set. Based on these findings, the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was developed, compared with other systems, and shown to provide more accurate prognoses regarding survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia in MDS patients. The improvement was due to several features of the workshop model: more refined cytogenetic categorization, inclusion of cytopenias, improved subdivision of marrow blast percentages, four subgroups defining outcome, and separate stratification for age. The IPSS should result in better-defined clinical outcomes in MDS and provide a framework for future studies determining the possible role of molecular determinants (e.g. oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cytokine expression and responsiveness) for evaluating prognoses. The IPSS will likely prove useful in the design and analysis of therapeutic trials in MDS as well as in patient management.","['Greenberg, P L']",['Greenberg PL'],"['Hematology Division, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00040-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 May;22 Suppl 1:S3-6. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00040-x.,,,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR products of the expected size for the specific rearrangements were detectable from a dilution of 100-1000 clonal cells in 150000 polyclonal cells. Both multiplex PCR systems were used to analyse samples from 86 childhood BCPALLs and 30 T-lineage ALLs. The results of the multiplex PCRs were controlled by standard PCR analyses for the individual rearrangements and Southern blots, which were identical. Only immature TCRdelta rearrangements were detected in BCP ALL (59%), whereas no rearrangement was found in the remaining BCP leukaemias, thus confirming the exclusive presence of immature TCRdelta rearrangements in B-lineage cells. 50% of the T-lineage ALLs contained mature rearrangements, but no immature rearrangements were found.

The amount of spontaneous apoptosis in the cell lines after serum-free culture paralleled their drug sensitivity: K562 cells displayed the least apoptosis at 24h (2.50 +/- 0.24%) and REH the most (24.47 +/- 8.22%). The extent of spontaneous apoptosis of leukaemic blasts from 39 patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML also correlated with the success of the intensive, infusional cytarabine-based induction therapy. There was a median of 19.5% (range 3.6-64%) apoptotic AML cells after 24 h of serum-free culture in patients who entered a complete remission compared with 4.2% (1.8-7.0%) apoptotic AML cells in patients who did not achieve a complete remission (P = 0.0007). Thus, inhibited apoptosis was associated with both in vitro and in vivo pan-resistance to antileukaemic chemotherapy.

Both sTNFRs were significantly higher in AML (p55-sTNFR 4.53 +/- 3.7, median 3.75; p75-sTNFR 6.51 +/- 5.25 ng/ml, median 4.72) and ALL sera (3.31 +/- 1.5, median 2.95; 5.30 +/- 2.3 ng/ml, median 4.56, respectively) than in controls (1.89 +/- 0.5, median 1.98; 2.22 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, median 2.37) (P < 0.01 for both sTNFRs). Fresh leukaemic cells expressed p55- and p75-sTNFRs, which were modulated and released into the supernatant (SN) following short-term in vitro culture, suggesting that in vivo sTNFRs were also leukaemia-derived. Whereas no correlation was observed between sTNFRs and outcome in ALL, in AML higher p55-sTNFR levels (> 3.75 ng/ml) were associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.006) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0004). At multivariate analysis p55-sTNFR was the most significant predictor of DFS (P = 0.006) and OS (P < 0.001).

Using PCR, the differential allele methylation status was evaluated on active and inactive X chromosomes at the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) loci. A cleavage ratio (CR) > or = 3.0 was adopted as a cut-off to discriminate between balanced and unbalanced X-chromosome inactivation. In adult women this analysis was also performed on hair bulbs. The frequency of skewed X-inactivation in polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells increased with age: CR > or = 3.0 was found in 3/36 cord blood samples, 5/30 young women and 14/31 elderly women. Mathematical analysis of patterns found in neonates indicated that X-chromosome inactivation probably occurs when the total number of haemopoietic stem cell precursors is 14-16. The inactivation patterns found in T lymphocytes were significantly related to those observed in PMNs in both young (P < 0.001) and elderly women (P < 0.01). However, the use of T lymphocytes as a control tissue for distinguishing between skewed inactivation and clonal proliferation proved to be reliable in young females, but not in elderly women, where overestimation of the frequency of clonal myelopoiesis may appear.","['Tonon, L', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Dellavecchia, C', 'Rosti, V', 'Lucotti, C', 'Malabarba, L', 'Novella, A', 'Vercesi, E', 'Frassoni, F', 'Cazzola, M']","['Tonon L', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Dellavecchia C', 'Rosti V', 'Lucotti C', 'Malabarba L', 'Novella A', 'Vercesi E', 'Frassoni F', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia Medical School and IRCCS Policlinico S.

TFPI is not an acute-phase reactant, but high levels have also been reported in patients with septicaemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

In a second cohort of 83 patients, total and free TFPI antigen, protein C, antithrombin, fibrin monomer and D-dimer were also measured. Elevated TFPI activity and antigens were found in about half of the patients with solid tumours. In contrast, elevated TFPI was rare in haematological malignancies (12%). In the 18 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), elevated free TFPI was found only in patients who also had DIC. No correlation was found between TFPI levels and fibrin monomer or D-dimer levels. Only four out of 20 patients with solid tumours had normal levels of fibrin monomer and D-dimer, yet three out of these four had elevated TFPI. In conclusion, elevated TFPI in ANLL is related to the coexistence of DIC.

RESULTS: Gibbon ape leukemia virus-pseudotyped vector yielded primary CTL transduction efficiency of 22.9+/-9.9%. After selection and expansion, 96.7+/-0.8% of CTL expressed retrovirally transferred genes. Recipient-specific cytotoxic activity was maintained with 84.3% specific lysis. After ganciclovir treatment, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase-transduced CTL proliferation was reduced 98.7+/-0.2% compared with controls.

The primary function of Tax is to transcriptionally activate the HTLV-1 promoter, but Tax is also known to stimulate expression of cellular genes. It has been reported to associate with several transcription factors, as well as proteins not involved in transcription. To better characterize potential cellular targets of Tax present in infected cells, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screening was performed with a cDNA library constructed from the HTLV-1-infected MT2 cell line. From this study, we found 158 positive clones representing seven different cDNAs. We focused our attention on the cDNA encoding the transcription factor CREB-2. CREB-2 is an unconventional member of the ATF/CREB family in that it lacks a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site and has been reported to negatively regulate transcription from the cyclic AMP response element of the human enkephalin promoter. In this study, we demonstrate that CREB-2 cooperates with Tax to enhance viral transcription and that its basic-leucine zipper C-terminal domain is required for both in vitro and in vivo interactions with Tax.

We determined the detailed distribution of nonecotropic proviruses in the mice by using both env- and long terminal repeat (LTR)-derived oligonucleotide probes specific for the three different groups of endogenous MLVs. The analysis indicated that proviruses that react with all of the specific probes are present in most wild mouse DNAs tested, in numbers varying from 1 or 2 to more than 50. Although in common inbred laboratory strains the linkage of group-specific sequences in env and the LTR of the proviruses is strict, proviruses which combine env and the LTR sequences from different groups were commonly observed in the wild-mouse subspecies. The ""recombinant"" nonecotropic proviruses in the mouse genomes were amplified by PCR, and their genetic and recombinant natures were determined. These proviruses showed extended genetic variation and provide a valuable probe for study of the evolutionary relationship between MLVs and the murine hosts.","['Tomonaga, K', 'Coffin, J M']","['Tomonaga K', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genes, env', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.10.8289-8300.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Oct;72(10):8289-300. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.10.8289-8300.1998.,"['GENBANK/AF017518', 'GENBANK/AF017519', 'GENBANK/AF017520', 'GENBANK/AF017521', 'GENBANK/AF017522', 'GENBANK/AF017523', 'GENBANK/AF017524', 'GENBANK/AF017525', 'GENBANK/AF017526', 'GENBANK/AF017527', 'GENBANK/AF017528', 'GENBANK/AF017529', 'GENBANK/AF017530', 'GENBANK/AF017531']",['R35CA44385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110191,,,,

D17 cells were treated with thymidine, hydroxyurea (HU), or AZT, and the effects on in vivo dNTP pools were measured. Thymidine and HU treatments induced significant dNTP pool imbalances.

To modulate the antiviral immune response induced by live attenuated SIV vaccines, we had previously infected rhesus monkeys with a nef deletion mutant of SIV expressing interleukin 2 (SIV-IL2) (B. R. Gundlach, H. Linhart, U. Dittmer, S. Sopper, S. Reiprich, D. Fuchs, B. Fleckenstein, G. Hunsmann, S. Stahl-Hennig, and K. Uberla, J. Virol. 71:2225-2232, 1997). In the present study, SIV-IL2-infected macaques and macaques infected with the nef deletion mutant SIVDeltaNU were challenged with pathogenic SIV 9 to 11 months postvaccination. In contrast to the results with naive control monkeys, no challenge virus could be isolated from the SIV-IL2- and SIVDeltaNU-infected macaques. However, challenge virus sequences could be detected by nested PCR in some of the vaccinated macaques. To determine the role of immune responses directed against Env of SIV, four vaccinated macaques were rechallenged with an SIV-murine leukemia virus (MLV) hybrid in which the env gene of SIV had been functionally replaced by the env gene of amphotropic MLV. All vaccinated macaques were protected from productive infection with the SIV-MLV hybrid in the absence of measurable neutralizing antibodies, while two naive control monkeys were readily infected. Since the SIV-MLV hybrid uses the MLV Env receptor Pit2 and not CD4 and a coreceptor for virus entry, chemokine inhibition and receptor interference phenomena were not involved in protection. These results indicate that the protective responses induced by live attenuated SIV vaccines can be independent of host immune reactions directed against Env.","['Gundlach, B R', 'Reiprich, S', 'Sopper, S', 'Means, R E', 'Dittmer, U', 'Matz-Rensing, K', 'Stahl-Hennig, C', 'Uberla, K']","['Gundlach BR', 'Reiprich S', 'Sopper S', 'Means RE', 'Dittmer U', 'Matz-Rensing K', 'Stahl-Hennig C', 'Uberla K']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', '*Genes, env', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Viral Vaccines/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.10.7846-7851.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Oct;72(10):7846-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.10.7846-7851.1998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110103,,,,

The first 28 nucleotides of the R region within the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the murine type C retrovirus SL3 were predicted to form a stem-loop structure. We tested whether this structure affected the transcriptional activity of the viral LTR. Mutations that altered either side of the stem and thus disrupted base pairing were generated. These decreased the level of expression of a reporter gene under the control of viral LTR sequences about 5-fold in transient expression assays and 10-fold in cells stably transformed with the LTR-reporter plasmids. We also generated a compensatory mutant in which both the ascending and descending sides of the stem were mutated such that the nucleotide sequence was different but the predicted secondary structure was maintained. Most of the activity of the wild-type SL3 element was restored in this mutant. Thus, the stem-loop structure was important for the maximum activity of the SL3 LTR. Primer extension analysis indicated that the stem-loop structure affected the levels of cytoplasmic RNA. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that deletion of the R region had a small effect on transcriptional initiation and no effect on RNA polymerase processivity. Thus, the main effect of the R-region element was on one or more steps that occurred after the template was transcribed by RNA polymerase. This finding implied that the main function of the R-region element involved RNA processing. R-region sequences of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or mouse mammary tumor virus could not replace the SL3 element. R-region sequences from an avian reticuloendotheliosis virus partially substituted for the SL3 sequences. R-region sequences from Moloney murine leukemia virus or feline leukemia virus did function in place of the SL3 element. Thus, the R region element appears to be a general feature of the mammalian type C genus of retroviruses.","['Cupelli, L', 'Okenquist, S A', 'Trubetskoy, A', 'Lenz, J']","['Cupelli L', 'Okenquist SA', 'Trubetskoy A', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.10.7807-7814.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Oct;72(10):7807-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.10.7807-7814.1998.,,"['R01 CA044822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,PMC110094,,,,

Recent evidence, however, suggests that viral transduction may induce unfavorable changes in EC phenotype. We examined the proliferative capacity and cell adhesion molecule (CAM) profile of EC after retroviral gene transfer (GT), employing a clinically relevant ex vivo GT protocol. METHODS: Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC, N = 14 isolates) were exposed to supernatants containing the MFG.nlsLACZ vector, which codes for a nuclear localized beta-galactosidase. Control HUVEC were exposed to empty virus (CRIP) or no virus (NT). Efficiency of GT was quantitated by direct counting of beta-galactosidase-stained cells on a grid. Proliferation was quantitated by a 1-week assay of viable cell counts. Expression of EC activation molecules (Class II major histocompatibility antigen [MHC II], E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]) was examined using fluorescent cytometry (FACS) at rest and after cytokine stimulation. RESULTS: GT was reproducibly efficient (mean 57%, range 40-77%) using sequential viral exposures without selection. NT, CRIP, and LACZ-transduced HUVEC exhibited identical FACS profiles for E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MHC II at rest, consistent with a nonactivated state. Upregulation of expression by cytokine was quantitatively similar for all groups. Growth rates were likewise not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Retroviral vectors may be employed to achieve high percentages of transduced EC for ex vivo GT without the use of selection. Transduced EC generated in this fashion are not activated, demonstrate an unaltered pattern of inducible CAM expression, and exhibit normal cell growth. The effects of GT on target cell phenotype are likely to be both vector and protocol specific and should be carefully assessed in each case prior to in vivo applications.","['Inaba, M', 'Toninelli, E', 'Vanmeter, G', 'Bender, J R', 'Conte, M S']","['Inaba M', 'Toninelli E', 'Vanmeter G', 'Bender JR', 'Conte MS']","['Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin/analysis/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/chemistry/*cytology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis/genetics', 'Lac Operon', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Phenotype', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis/genetics']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-4804(98)95379-3 [pii]', '10.1006/jsre.1998.5379 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 1998 Jul 15;78(1):31-6. doi: 10.1006/jsre.1998.5379.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Included in our assay were cytokines with known expression in RPE to get a broad basis for comparing IPE cells: basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2), and one of its receptor (FGFR-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and its receptor EGF-R, transforming growth factor beta(TGFbeta), and its type III receptor TGFbeta-R3, the platelet-derived growth factors and receptors (PDGF A, PDGF B, PDGF-Ralpha, PDGF-Rbeta), tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNFalpha), and two receptors TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, insulin (INS) with receptor INS-R, insulin-like growth factors (IGF1, IGF2), and receptors (IGF1-R, IGF2-R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and two receptors (VEGF-R1 or FLT-1 and VEGF-R2 or FLK-1), the receptor for VEGF-C: VEGF-R3 or FLK-4, interleukin 6 (IL6), and its receptor (IL6-R), nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin 1alpha(IL1alpha), and a receptor (IL1-R). In addition, cytokines or their receptors not known to be expressed in RPE were included to widen our picture of cytokine gene expression in the eye: stem cell factor (SCF), its receptor (SCF-R), low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75 (p75(NGF-R), ciliary neutrothropic factor (CNTF), and its receptor (CNTF-R), glycoprotein 130 interleukin 6 transducer (gp130 (IL6-SD), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and its receptor (LIF-R). Semi-quantitative expression data were obtained using series of fivefold dilutions of each cDNA and a fixed number of PCR cycles. The expression of RPE 65, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and beta2-microglobulin (B2MG) was used as a control for cellular origin, RNA quality and PCR conditions. With the exception of insulin and tumor necrosis factor alphaall other cytokines analysed and their receptors were expressed in both IPE and RPE cells, even though the levels varied. No qualitative or quantitative difference were observed in the mRNA expression level of 34 (94%) of the cytokines or receptors between IPE and RPE. In contrast, the mRNA expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [VEGF-RS (FLK-1)] was lower in IPE than in RPE cells. As an increased expression of VEGF in the RPE in maculae with age-related macular disease could be involved in its pathogenesis, a decreased expression of angiogenic growth factors in IPE cells could possibly be beneficial for the therapy of age-related maculopathy if indeed other tasks of non-functional RPE cells could be performed by IPE cells. The similarity of the mRNA expression pattern in 94% of the cytokines analyzed supports the assumption that IPE cells potentially can perform functions of RPE cells in the appropriate environment.","['Kociok, N', 'Heppekausen, H', 'Schraermeyer, U', 'Esser, P', 'Thumann, G', 'Grisanti, S', 'Heimann, K']","['Kociok N', 'Heppekausen H', 'Schraermeyer U', 'Esser P', 'Thumann G', 'Grisanti S', 'Heimann K']","['Department of Vitreoretinal Surgery, University Eye Hospital, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Eye Res,Experimental eye research,0370707,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Substances/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iris/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/09/12 00:00,1998/09/12 00:01,['1998/09/12 00:00'],"['1998/09/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4835(98)90517-6 [pii]', '10.1006/exer.1998.0517 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Eye Res. 1998 Aug;67(2):237-50. doi: 10.1006/exer.1998.0517.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

DBCP (30-300 micromol/L) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the levels of DNA single-strand breaks in both cell lines as well as in cultured human renal proximal tubular cells. After extended DBCP exposure in LLCPK1 cells (100 micromol/L, 30 h), the level of DNA breaks returned almost to control values. Incubation for 48 h showed a clear reduction of growth with DBCP concentrations as low as 10 micromol/L. Flow cytometric analysis showed that DBCP (1-10 micromol/L) exposure for 24 h caused an accumulation of LLCPK1 cells in the G2/M-phase. In HL-60 cells the accumulation in G2/M-phase was less marked, and at higher concentrations the cells accumulated in S-phase. Flow cytometric studies of HL-60 and LLCPK1 cells exposed to 100-500 micromol/L DBCP showed increased number of apoptotic cells/bodies with a lower DNA content than that of the G1 cells. Microscopic studies revealed that there were increased numbers of cells with nuclear condensation and fragmentation, indicating that apoptosis was the dominant mode of death in these cell lines, following exposure to DBCP. The characteristic ladder pattern of apoptotic cells was observed when DNA from DBCP-treated HL-60 cells and LLCPK1 cells was electrophoresed in agarose. The finding that DBCP can cause an accumulation of cells in G2/M-phase and induce apoptosis in vitro may be of importance for the development of DBCP-induced toxicity in vivo.","['Wiger, R', 'Holme, J A', 'Hongslo, J K', 'Brunborg, G', 'Haug, K', 'Rodilla, V', 'Dybing, E', 'Soderlund, E J']","['Wiger R', 'Holme JA', 'Hongslo JK', 'Brunborg G', 'Haug K', 'Rodilla V', 'Dybing E', 'Soderlund EJ']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, National Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Antinematodal Agents)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '96K0FD4803 (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane)', 'T75W9911L6 (Propane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antinematodal Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Propane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Swine']",1998/09/11 00:00,1998/09/11 00:01,['1998/09/11 00:00'],"['1998/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1007482924707 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 1998 Aug;14(4):267-82. doi: 10.1023/a:1007482924707.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients suffering from aplastic anemia (n = 3) received a 4-day course of CP at a dose of 50 mg/kg daily infused intravenously (i.v.) over 1 h. Patients with leukemia (n = 13) were given either a combination of busulphan followed by CP at a dose of 50 mg/kg infused i.v. over 1 h for 4 days, or CP at a dose of 60 mg/kg by i.v. infusion over 1 h daily for 2 days followed by total body irradiation. Serial plasma samples and urine were collected after the start of the first CP dose. CP was analyzed by capillary gas chromatography, whereas ACRO was measured in urine by liquid chromatography. The plasma concentration-time data for CP conformed to the two-compartment model and the mean and s.e.m. values of alpha, beta, Vss, total clearance, and renal clearance observed were 1.29 (0.31) h(-1), 0.17 (0.03) h(-1), 0.67 (0.13) l/kg, 0.14 (0.02) l/h x kg, and 0.0188 (0.0052) l/h x kg, respectively.

Two patients developed hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). Each of these two patients excreted significantly (P < 0.01) more ACRO in the first and second 4-h urine collection periods. However, there was no significant difference in fmu or Cmu(n) of ACRO between either of these two patients and the rest.

Following allograft, CR was achieved in 71% patients. Eight are currently alive, with six in CR at a median of 18.5 months (range 7-28) from the transplant. Two patients died, 1 and 4 months from the allograft, respectively, and one is alive with progression. A PCR analysis of IgH rearrangement showed that residual disease was no more molecularly detectable in four out of seven evaluated patients following allograft.

There are no exactly defined protocols for single-agent treatment because a clear definition of low risk febrile neutropenia is lacking. This paper examines the safety and efficacy of once-daily ceftriaxone in 376 cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective observational study carried out between February 1992 and January 1996, 959 febrile episodes at 48 hospitals were recorded. Inclusion criteria were neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, ANC <1,000/ microl) with fever (>/=38.5 degreesC) or a C-reactive protein concentration >1 mg/dl and suspected infection. Nine hundred and one episodes (acute leukemia n = 396, lymphoma n = 220, solid tumors n = 272 and other disorders n = 13) in 828 patients aged between 1 and 97 years were analyzed, of which 876 episodes were evaluable for response. All patients initially underwent empirical treatment with ceftriaxone (adults: 2 g/day; children: 80 mg/kg/day), either alone (376) or in combination with other agents (525). RESULTS: The mean ANC was 423/ microl (SD +/- 316) and the median duration of neutropenia 10 days. Of the 363 episodes treated initially with ceftriaxone alone, 70.8% responded versus 56.9% in the combination therapy group. The favorable response to the initial monotherapy treatment was explained by a low-risk population in the monotherapy group. A KI >6 (p < 0.0001), ANC >/=500/ microl (p = 0.0001) and a duration of ANC <5 days (p < 0.05) were significantly more frequent in the monotherapy arm and were predictive of lower risk at the commencement of treatment. CONCLUSION: Ceftriaxone is effective in febrile neutropenia. Treatment with ceftriaxone alone was safe and highly effective in low-risk patients. Single-agent regimens appear to be a suitable treatment option in low-risk febrile neutropenia.","['Karthaus, M', 'Wolf, H H', 'Kampfe, D', 'Egerer, G', 'Ritter, J', 'Peters, G', 'Sudhoff, T', 'Franke, A', 'Heil, G', 'Kullmann, K H', 'Jurgens, H']","['Karthaus M', 'Wolf HH', 'Kampfe D', 'Egerer G', 'Ritter J', 'Peters G', 'Sudhoff T', 'Franke A', 'Heil G', 'Kullmann KH', 'Jurgens H']","['Department of Hematology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Ceftriaxone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cephalosporins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/09/10 02:03,2000/08/16 11:00,['1998/09/10 02:03'],"['1998/09/10 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [medline]', '1998/09/10 02:03 [entrez]']","['che44343 [pii]', '10.1159/000007134 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 1998 Sep-Oct;44(5):343-54. doi: 10.1159/000007134.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to find suitable model systems to study cAMP-mediated processes, we have examined the expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), endogenous levels of cAMP, and cell proliferation in eight cell lines of B lineage origin, four cell lines of T lineage origin, and normal human B and T cells. We demonstrated that the expression of mRNA and protein for one of the regulatory (R) subunits of PKA (RIalpha) was present in all the cells investigated, in contrast to the other R subunits (RIbeta, RIIalpha, and RIIbeta). Furthermore, three T cell lines and one B cell line expressed only RIalpha and C, implying these cells to contain solely PKA type I. Moreover, for the RI subunit, we observed an apparent reciprocal relationship between levels of mRNA and protein. Generally, RIalpha protein was low in cell lines where mRNA was elevated and vice versa. This was not the case for the RII subunits, where high levels of mRNA were associated with elevated levels of protein. Interestingly, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between levels of endogenous cAMP and cell growth as determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell-doubling rate (P < 0.05). Taken together, our results demonstrate great differences in PKA isozyme composition, which should be taken into consideration when using lymphoid cell lines as model system for cAMP/PKA effects in normal lymphocytes.","['Skalhegg, B S', 'Johansen, A K', 'Levy, F O', 'Andersson, K B', 'Aandahl, E M', 'Blomhoff, H K', 'Hansson, V', 'Tasken, K']","['Skalhegg BS', 'Johansen AK', 'Levy FO', 'Andersson KB', 'Aandahl EM', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Hansson V', 'Tasken K']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, Norway. bjorn.skalhegg@basalmed.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/analysis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Tritium']",1998/09/10 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/09/10 02:03'],"['1998/09/10 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/09/10 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199810)177:1<85::AID-JCP9>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199810)177:1<85::AID-JCP9>3.0.CO;2-A [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1998 Oct;177(1):85-93. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199810)177:1<85::AID-JCP9>3.0.CO;2-A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cells, thrombin stimulation of proliferation appears to require both cleavage of the proteolytically activated receptor for thrombin (PAR1) and activation of a nonproteolytically activated thrombin receptor (N-PAR), while in others activation of either receptor alone may be sufficient for stimulation. We, therefore, have initiated studies to address thrombin receptor expression and cell responsiveness to thrombin in interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-differentiated and nondifferentiated U937 monocytic cells. Northern blot analysis shows that PAR1 expression is upregulated upon differentiation. Experiments with biotinylated and 125I-thrombin show that specific thrombin binding is dramatically increased by differentiation although it is not clear if this binding is to PAR1 or to a separate binding component such as N-PAR which is present on fibroblasts and other cells. Addition of thrombin at concentrations of 1-10 microg/ml (30-300 nM, concentrations where specific thrombin binding is observed) stimulates proliferation of IFNgamma-differentiated U937 cells but not of undifferentiated U937 cells. Thrombin also stimulates interleukin-6 (IL6) production in IFNgamma-differentiated U937 cells. Moreover, thrombin induces high levels of IL6, interleukin-1beta (IL1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocytes. These results show that differentiated U937 cells and mature PBMC are responsive to thrombin whereas nondifferentiated U937 are not. Further, this responsiveness appears to correlate with expression of PAR1 and to a dramatic increase in specific thrombin binding. That thrombin stimulates cytokine production and proliferation in populations of differentiated monocytes suggests that thrombin may be an important regulator of inflammation and wound healing.","['Naldini, A', 'Sower, L', 'Bocci, V', 'Meyers, B', 'Carney, D H']","['Naldini A', 'Sower L', 'Bocci V', 'Meyers B', 'Carney DH']","['University of Siena, Institute of General Physiology, Italy.

The three variants of BOD (long, medium, and short) have an open reading frame of 196, 110, and 93 amino acids, respectively; all of them contain a consensus Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain but lack other BH domains found in channel-forming Bcl-2 family proteins. In the yeast cell assay, BOD interacts with diverse antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BHRF-1] but not with different proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (BAD, Bak, Bok, and Bax). After overexpression in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, BOD induces apoptosis that can be prevented by the baculoviral caspase inhibitor P35. The cell-killing activity of BOD is also antagonized in cells cotransfected with the antiapoptotic Bcl-w protein, which showed high affinity for BOD in the two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies showed that BOD mutants with alterations in the BH3 domain lose cell-killing ability, suggesting that the BH3 domain is important for the mediation of cell killing by BOD. BOD mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in ovary and multiple other tissues. The BOD gene is also conserved in diverse mammalian species. Identification of BOD expands the group of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that only contains the BH3 domain and allows future elucidation of the intracellular mechanism for apoptosis regulation in ovary and other tissues.","['Hsu, S Y', 'Lin, P', 'Hsueh, A J']","['Hsu SY', 'Lin P', 'Hsueh AJ']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5317, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, rat)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.12.9.0166 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1998 Sep;12(9):1432-40. doi: 10.1210/mend.12.9.0166.,"['GENBANK/AF065431', 'GENBANK/AF065432', 'GENBANK/AF065433']",['HD-31566/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, using several deletion and mutated plasmids of the 5'-flanking regulatory region of the IL-8 gene linked to the luciferase gene as a reporter and mutant tax gene expression vectors, we have established that both AP-1 at -126 to -120 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-like cis-element at -80 to -71 are essential and sufficient for the induction of the IL-8 gene by HTLV-I Tax. In addition, overexpression of the dominant-negative mutants of NF-kappaB inhibitor molecules, IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, abolished the Tax-induced activation of IL-8 gene. Gel mobility shift assays detected proteins specifically binding to the AP-1 and NF-kappaB-like sites in Tax-expressing T-cell lines infected with HTLV-I. Similarly, the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two motifs was shown in JPX-9 cells, a subclone of Jurkat cells, carrying the Tax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that the cooperation of transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 is essential for transactivation of IL-8 gene by HTLV-I Tax.","['Mori, N', 'Mukaida, N', 'Ballard, D W', 'Matsushima, K', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Mori N', 'Mukaida N', 'Ballard DW', 'Matsushima K', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, Research Field of Pathogenesis and Clinical Sciences, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Sakamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Sep 1;58(17):3993-4000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using deoxyadenosine-resistant L1210 cells (ED2 and Y8) that had ribonucleotide reductase that was not sensitive to inhibition by dATP and also exhibited other metabolic alterations, the properties of these cells with respect to the role(s) of nucleotides in these functions were explored. In the ED2 and Y8 cells that did not express p53 protein, the pools of UTP, CTP, ATP, and GTP were markedly decreased. The decreased cellular levels of UTP and CTP did not result in these cells being more sensitive to either PALA or acivicin. The ED2 and Y8 cells did not block in G0/G1 in response to PALA treatment even though the basal cellular concentrations of UTP and CTP were reduced 50 to 80%. While it has been shown that dATP in combination with cytochrome c is involved in the apoptotic pathway, the concentration of exogenous deoxyadenosine required to induce apoptosis in the parental L1210 cells was far in excess of the concentration required to inhibit cell growth. Deoxyadenosine did not cause an increase in apoptosis in the deoxyadenosine-resistant Y8 cells.

A full-length cDNA encoding siglec-5 was isolated from a human activated monocyte cDNA library. Sequencing predicted that siglec-5 contains four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, the N-terminal two of which are 57% identical to the corresponding region of CD33. The cytoplasmic tail is also related to that of CD33, containing two tyrosine residues embodied in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-like motifs. The siglec-5 gene was shown to map to chromosome 19q13.41-43, closely linked to the CD33 gene. When siglec-5 was expressed on COS cells or as a recombinant protein fused to the Fc region of human IgG1, it was able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding to human erythrocytes and soluble glycoconjugates, suggesting that it may be involved in cell-cell interactions. By using specific antibodies, siglec-5 was found to have an expression pattern distinct from that of CD33, being present at relatively high levels on neutrophils but absent from leukemic cell lines representing early stages of myelomonocytic differentiation. Western blot analysis of neutrophil lysates indicated that siglec-5 exists as a disulfide-linked dimer of approximately 140 kD.","['Cornish, A L', 'Freeman, S', 'Forbes, G', 'Ni, J', 'Zhang, M', 'Cepeda, M', 'Gentz, R', 'Augustus, M', 'Carter, K C', 'Crocker, P R']","['Cornish AL', 'Freeman S', 'Forbes G', 'Ni J', 'Zhang M', 'Cepeda M', 'Gentz R', 'Augustus M', 'Carter KC', 'Crocker PR']","['The Wellcome Trust Building, Department of Biochemistry, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK; the Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; and Human Genome Sciences Inc, Rockville, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (SIGLEC5 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/blood', 'Neutrophils/chemistry', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74083-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 15;92(6):2123-32.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

We demonstrate that the inversion creates a fusion between the 5' end of MOZ mRNA and the 3' end of TIF2 mRNA maintaining the translational frame of the protein. The predicted fusion protein contains the zinc finger domains, the nuclear localization domains, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, and a portion of the acidic domain of MOZ, coupled to the CREB-binding protein (CBP) interaction domain and the activation domains of TIF2. The breakpoint is distinct from the breakpoint in the t(8;16)(p11;p13) translocation in acute monocytic leukemia with erythrophagocytosis that fuses MOZ with CBP. The reciprocal TIF2-MOZ fusion gene is not expressed, perhaps as a result of a deletion near the chromosome 8 centromere.

In addition to normal hematopoietic precursors, expression of the FL receptor, flt3R, has been frequently demonstrated on the blast cells from patients with acute B-lineage lymphoblastic, myeloid, and biphenotypic (also known as hybrid or mixed) leukemias. Because many of these leukemic cell types express FL, the possibility has been raised that altered regulation of FL-mediated signaling might contribute to malignant transformation or expansion of the leukemic clone. In humans, FL is predominantly synthesized as a transmembrane protein that must undergo proteolytic cleavage to generate a soluble form. To investigate the consequences of constitutively expressing the analogous murine FL isoform in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, lethally irradiated syngeneic mice (18 total) were engrafted with post-5-fluorouracil-treated bone marrow cells transduced ex vivo with a recombinant retroviral vector (MSCV-FL) encoding murine transmembrane FL. Compared with control mice (8 total), MSCV-FL mice presented with a mild macrocytic anemia but were otherwise healthy for more than 5 months posttransplant (until 22 weeks). Subsequently, all primary MSCV-FL recipients observed for up to 1 year plus 83% (20 of 24) of secondary MSCV-FL animals that had received bone marrow from asymptomatic primary hosts reconstituted for 4 to 5 months developed transplantable hematologic malignancies (with mean latency periods of 30 and 23 weeks, respectively). Phenotypic and molecular analyses indicated that the tumor cells expressed flt3R and displayed B-cell and/or myeloid markers. These data, establishing that dysregulated expression of FL in primitive hematopoietic cells predisposes flt3R+ precursors to leukemic transformation, underscore a potential role of this cytokine/receptor combination in certain human leukemias.","['Hawley, T S', 'Fong, A Z', 'Griesser, H', 'Lyman, S D', 'Hawley, R G']","['Hawley TS', 'Fong AZ', 'Griesser H', 'Lyman SD', 'Hawley RG']","['Oncology Gene Therapy Program, The Toronto Hospital, and the Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; the Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74070-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 15;92(6):2003-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

Egr-1 also was observed to block granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced differentiation of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32Dcl3 hematopoietic precursor cells, endowing the cells with the ability to be induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for terminal differentiation along the macrophage lineage. To better understand the function of Egr-1 as a positive modulator of monocytic differentiation, in this work we have studied the effect of ectopic expression of Egr-1 on the murine myeloblastic leukemic cell line M1, which is induced for differentiation by the physiological inducer IL-6. It is shown that, unlike in HL-60 and 32Dcl3 cells, ectopic expression of Egr-1 in M1 cells resulted in activation of the macrophage differentiation program in the absence of differentiation inducer. This included the appearance of morphologically differentiated cells, decreased growth rate in mass culture, and cloning efficiency in soft agar, and expression of endogenous c-myb and c-myc mRNAs was markedly downregulated. Untreated M1Egr-1 cells also exhibited cell adherence, expression of Fc and C3 receptors, and upregulation of the myeloid differentiation primary response genes c-Jun, junD, and junB and the late genetic markers ferritin light-chain and lysozyme. Ectopic expression of Egr-1 in M1 cells also dramatically increased the sensitivity of the cells for IL-6-induced differentiation, allowed a higher proportion of M1 cells to become terminally differentiated under conditions of optimal stimulation for differentiation, and decreased M1 leukemogenicity in vivo. These findings demonstrate that the functions of Egr-1 as a positive modulator of macrophage differentiation vary, depending on the state of lineage commitment for differentiation of the hematopoietic cell type.","['Krishnaraju, K', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Krishnaraju K', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, and Department of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/*physiology']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74065-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 15;92(6):1957-66.,,"['1RO1CA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA59774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P3CA12227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

To appreciate the early and late risks associated with this procedure, its lethal toxicity and effects on the incidence of secondary cancers were studied. Data related to 467 French patients grafted from 1982 to 1995 for primary sensitive disease (PSD, 22%), primary refractory disease (PRD, 18%), first relapse (R1, 45%), or subsequent relapses (R2, 15%) were analyzed. Grafted patients (PSD, PRD, and R1; n = 393) were matched (3 controls for 1 case) on age, gender, clinical stage, B symptoms, and time at risk with 1179 conventionally treated patients issued from international databases. The proportional hazards (Cox) model was used to assess relative risks (RR). Among grafted patients, 8% died of toxicity related to the procedure, and 18 secondary cancers occurred leading to a 5-year cumulative incidence rate of 8.9%. In this series, risk factors for second cancer were age >/=40 years (RR = 3.73, P = .007) and the use of peripheral blood stem cells as source of graft (RR = 3.10, P = .03). Among grafted and matched ungrafted patients, risk factors for the development of secondary cancer were age >/=40 years (RR = 2.90, P < .001), relapse versus no relapse (RR = 5.22, P = .006), PRD versus other patients (RR = 3.86, P = .033), and grafted versus ungrafted patients (RR = 2.04, P = . 024). Solid tumors were more frequent in grafted than in ungrafted patients (RR = 5.19, P = .001) although the incidence of myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia was similar in the two groups. We conclude that high-dose chemotherapy administered as first-line treatment or after relapse is associated with an acceptable toxic death rate. The risk of secondary myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia is not significantly increased after autologous stem-cell transplantation for HD, whereas an increased risk of solid tumors exists. The peripheral blood stem-cell-associated risk of secondary cancer among grafted patients needs further investigations.","['Andre, M', 'Henry-Amar, M', 'Blaise, D', 'Colombat, P', 'Fleury, J', 'Milpied, N', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Pico, J L', 'Bastion, Y', 'Kuentz, M', 'Nedellec, G', 'Attal, M', 'Ferme, C', 'Gisselbrecht, C']","['Andre M', 'Henry-Amar M', 'Blaise D', 'Colombat P', 'Fleury J', 'Milpied N', 'Cahn JY', 'Pico JL', 'Bastion Y', 'Kuentz M', 'Nedellec G', 'Attal M', 'Ferme C', 'Gisselbrecht C']","['Hematology Institute, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Clinical Research Unit and INSERM CJF 96-03/GRECAN, Centre Regional Francois Baclesse, Caen, France; Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Institut Paoli-Calmette, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*mortality', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/drug therapy/*mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects/methods/*mortality', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1998/09/10 00:00,1998/09/10 00:01,['1998/09/10 00:00'],"['1998/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74062-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Sep 15;92(6):1933-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,

We report the long-term outcomes, including response rates and their duration; time-to-treatment failure (TTF) rates; retreatment results; toxicities; and survival rates of patients treated at Scripps Clinic (La Jolla, CA). A total of 358 patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with cladribine at 0.087 or 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days. The expected number of second neoplasms was based on the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data. Of 349 evaluable patients, 319 (91%) achieved an initial complete response and 22 (7%) a partial response with an overall median duration of response follow-up of 52 months. Ninety patients (26%) had relapsed at a median of 29 months. The TTF rate for all 341 responders was 19% at 48 months, 16% for complete responders, and 54% for partial responders. Of 53 evaluable patients treated with second courses of cladribine at first relapse, 33 (62%) achieved complete responses and 14 (26%) partial responses. Twenty-seven patients (8%) developed second neoplasms (only 1 hematopoietic) with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1.88 (95% confidence interval, 1.24 to 2.74). The overall survival rate was 96% at 48 months. Single courses of cladribine induced long-lasting complete responses in the vast majority of patients. Relapse rates for complete responders were low. Patients who relapse can be successfully retreated with cladribine.
