As the effect of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on tumour cells is the same (attack on cancer cells), the response of the tumour to injury and cell loss from the two treatment methods should be similar, including repopulation. Cell recruitment is known to be a possible mechanism responsible for tumour regrowth after radiotherapy. The literature data regarding mechanisms of repopulation after chemotherapy is very limited. The current paper employs a Monte Carlo modelling approach to implement the pharmacokinetics of a widely used drug (cisplatin) into a previously developed virtual head and neck tumour and to study the effect of cisplatin on tumour regression and regrowth during treatment. The mechanism of cell recruitment was modelled by releasing various percentages (5-50%) of quiescent cells into the mitotic cycle after each chemotherapy cell kill. The onset of repopulation was also simulated, with both immediate onset and late onset of cell recruitment. Repopulation during chemotherapy, if occurring, is a highly potent phenomenon, similar to drug resistance, therefore it should not be neglected during treatment.","['Marcu, Loredana', 'Bezak, Eva']","['Marcu L', 'Bezak E']","['School of Chemistry and Physics, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia. loredana.marcu@fizicaoradea.ro']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100723,Netherlands,Australas Phys Eng Sci Med,Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,8208130,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/*pathology']",2010/07/24 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13246-010-0026-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas Phys Eng Sci Med. 2010 Sep;33(3):265-70. doi: 10.1007/s13246-010-0026-4.

From them, only a small subset of cell types is able to produce histamine. They include some neurons, enterochromaffin-like cells, gastrin-containing cells, mast cells, basophils, and monocytes/macrophages, among others. In spite of the reduced number of these histamine-producing cell types, they are involved in very different physiological processes. Their deregulation is related with many highly prevalent, as well as emergent and rare diseases, mainly those described as inflammation-dependent pathologies, including mastocytosis, basophilic leukemia, gastric ulcer, Crohn disease, and other inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, oncogenic transformation switches some non-histamine-producing cells to a histamine producing phenotype. This is the case of melanoma, small cell lung carcinoma, and several types of neuroendocrine tumors. The bioactive compound epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major component of green tea, has been shown to target histamine-producing cells producing great alterations in their behavior, with relevant effects on their proliferative potential, as well as their adhesion, migration, and invasion potentials. In fact, EGCG has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, and anti-angiogenic effects and to be a potent inhibitor of the histamine-producing enzyme, histidine decarboxylase. Herein, we review the many specific effects of EGCG on concrete molecular targets of histamine-producing cells and discuss the relevance of these data to support the potential therapeutic interest of this compound to treat inflammation-dependent diseases.","['Melgarejo, Esther', 'Medina, Miguel Angel', 'Sanchez-Jimenez, Francisca', 'Urdiales, Jose Luis']","['Melgarejo E', 'Medina MA', 'Sanchez-Jimenez F', 'Urdiales JL']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Bioquimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Malaga and CIBER de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100722,Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Tea)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/metabolism', 'Basophils/drug effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Histamine/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Tea/chemistry']",2010/07/24 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13105-010-0033-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2010 Sep;66(3):265-70. doi: 10.1007/s13105-010-0033-7.

Complete remission was generally achieved only in about 50% to 60% of patients, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), when feasible in younger patients, was virtually the sole curative modality. Imatinib has changed the situation dramatically, however, in combination with conventional chemotherapy or with corticosteroid alone, producing about 95% complete remission and thus increasing the number of patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Currently, the overall survival of patients who have undergone allo-HSCT exceeds 50%, and a considerable proportion of patients for whom allo-HSCT is not feasible are predictably curable. The next question is how to prevent relapse, which is observed not only in more than half of patients for whom allo-HSCT is not feasible but also in a considerable number of patients after allo-HSCT. Thus, improvement of postremission therapy is crucial. Whether intensive chemotherapy with currently available cytotoxic drugs contributes to the prevention of relapse is questionable, because intensive chemotherapy alone in the pre-imatinib era nearly always failed to cure this disease. Promising partners to be combined with imatinib or with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) will be corticosteroids and vincristine. New TKIs such as dasatinib should be incorporated into the early phase of postremission therapy. Recognizing the small number of patients with Ph(+) ALL, intergroup or international studies are necessary to develop the best postremission therapy. In the near future, it is hoped that Ph(+) ALL will become one of the leukemias for which allo-HSCT is offered only for relapsed or extremely high-risk patients.","['Ohno, Ryuzo']",['Ohno R'],"['Aichi Cancer Center, Kanokoden, Chikusaku, Nagoya, Japan. ohnoryu@asu.aasa.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2010/07/24 06:00,2011/01/13 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-010-0061-y [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2010 Oct;5(4):213-21. doi: 10.1007/s11899-010-0061-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated whether the therapeutic effect of bortezomib in lymphoma is associated with FGFR3-expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed in minimal FGFR3 expressing U937 cells and compared to U937 cells overexpressing FGFR3 wild-type, or Y373C or K650E mutant FGFR3. RESULTS: Results from this study suggested the expression of FGFR3 protein is associated with the therapeutic effect of bortezomib. It was observed that bortezomib-induced apoptotic death is correlated with FGFR3 expression. U937 cells overexpression of wild-type FGFR3 demonstrated resistance to bortezomib treatment. U937 cells expressing Y373C mutated FGFR3 showed an almost equal resistance to bortezomib as U937 cells expressing wild-type FGFR3. U937 cells expressing mutated K650E FGFR3 showed more sensitivity to bortezomib than did the parental U937 cells. Furthermore, increased expression of Mcl-1 and decreased expression of NF-kappaB p65 suggested that bortezomib resistance associated with Y373C mutation and wild-type FGFR3 may be partly mediated through Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB signaling. CONCLUSION: Data from this study indicate that mutation status and the expression level of FGFR3 may be associated with bortezomib-related treatment resistance in lymphoma.","['Zheng, Weiyan', 'Guan, Min', 'Zhu, Lijun', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Chung, Vincent', 'Huang, He', 'Yen, Yun']","['Zheng W', 'Guan M', 'Zhu L', 'Cai Z', 'Chung V', 'Huang H', 'Yen Y']","['Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3/*genetics/physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2010/07/24 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['30/6/1921 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Jun;30(6):1921-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High expression of WT1 is also associated with relapse and shortened disease-free survival in patients. However, the mechanisms by which WT1 expression is regulated in leukemia remain unclear. Here, we report that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which plays a critical role in the folding and maturation of several oncogenic proteins, associates with WT1 protein and stabilizes its expression. Pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependant degradation of WT1. RNAi-mediated silencing of WT1 reduced the survival of leukemia cells and increased the sensitivity of these cells to chemotherapy and Hsp90 inhibition. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG [17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin] and STA-9090 significantly reduced the growth of myeloid leukemia xenografts in vivo and effectively down-regulated the expression of WT1 and its downstream target proteins, c-Myc and Bcl-2. Collectively, our studies identify WT1 as a novel Hsp90 client and support the crucial role for the WT1-Hsp90 interaction in maintaining leukemia cell survival. These findings have significant implications for developing effective therapies for myeloid leukemias and offer a strategy to inhibit the oncogenic functions of WT1 by clinically available Hsp90 inhibitors.","['Bansal, Hima', 'Bansal, Sanjay', 'Rao, Manjeet', 'Foley, Kevin P', 'Sang, Jim', 'Proia, David A', 'Blackman, Ronald K', 'Ying, Weiwen', 'Barsoum, James', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Kelly, Kevin', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Tomlinson, Gail E', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Lee, Kelvin P', 'Padmanabhan, Swaminathan']","['Bansal H', 'Bansal S', 'Rao M', 'Foley KP', 'Sang J', 'Proia DA', 'Blackman RK', 'Ying W', 'Barsoum J', 'Baer MR', 'Kelly K', 'Swords R', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Battiwalla M', 'Giles FJ', 'Lee KP', 'Padmanabhan S']","['Cancer Therapy and Research Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA. bansals@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100722,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (STA 9090)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/24 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31015-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-247239 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4591-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-247239.

The mechanism by which PTPN11 mutations induce this disease is not fully understood. Signaling partners that mediate the pathogenic effects of PTPN11 mutations have not been explored. Here we report that germ line mutation Ptpn11(D61G) in mice aberrantly accelerates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cycling, increases the stem cell pool, and elevates short-term and long-term repopulating capabilities, leading to the development of MPD. MPD is reproduced in primary and secondary recipient mice transplanted with Ptpn11(D61G/+) whole bone marrow cells or purified Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells, but not lineage committed progenitors. The deleterious effects of Ptpn11(D61G) mutation on HSCs are attributable to enhancing cytokine/growth factor signaling. The aberrant HSC activities caused by Ptpn11(D61G) mutation are largely corrected by deletion of Gab2, a prominent interacting protein and target of Shp-2 in cell signaling. As a result, MPD phenotypes are markedly ameliorated in Ptpn11(D61G/+)/Gab2(-/-) double mutant mice. Collectively, our data suggest that oncogenic Ptpn11 induces MPD by aberrant activation of HSCs. This study also identifies Gab2 as an important mediator for the pathogenic effects of Ptpn11 mutations.","['Xu, Dan', 'Wang, Siying', 'Yu, Wen-Mei', 'Chan, Gordon', 'Araki, Toshiyuki', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Neel, Benjamin G', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Xu D', 'Wang S', 'Yu WM', 'Chan G', 'Araki T', 'Bunting KD', 'Neel BG', 'Qu CK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100722,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/enzymology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Interleukin-3/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/24 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31158-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-265652 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 4;116(18):3611-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-265652.

Mutations correlated significantly with an NPM1 mutation (P < .0001) but not a FLT3/ITD (P = .9). No difference in outcome between IDH1(+) and IDH1(-) patients was found in univariate or multivariate analysis, or if the results were stratified by NPM1 mutation status.

Differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells is inhibited by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Removal of LIF allows the cells to differentiate into a morphologically distinct endodermal-type cell. Colonies of ES cells are maintained from which cells can be harvested daily, and these cells, when washed free of LIF, form a population of differentiating cells on which the effects of chemicals can be tested. The protocol used is similar to that of the micromass test, with differentiating ES cells substituted for rat primary embryonic cells, and the effects of 25 compounds have been investigated in a blind trial. The four potent teratogens were all positive: false negatives occurred only among moderate and weak teratogens. Seven of the 10 non-teratogens were negative. Results were generally similar to those reported for the micromass test. In the light of these findings, and with appropriate multicentre validation, the stem-cell test may be suitable for hazard labelling of industrial chemicals.

It has been shown that one-electron reduction of the VP-16 phenoxyl radical by ascorbate and thiols prevents/delays its oxidative metabolism by tyrosinase both in model systems and in cell homogenates. To elucidate the role of endogenous thiols in the reduction of VP-16 phenoxyl radicals, K562 human leukaemia cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium which does not contain vitamin C (ascorbate) were used, thus excluding the ascorbate-dependent reduction of VP-16 phenoxyl radicals. VP-16 phenoxyl radicals were reduced by endogenous reductants in K562 cell homogenates, intracellular thiols mainly being responsible. Depletion of endogenous thiols by mersalyl acid resulted in almost complete inhibition of the ability of cell homogenates to reduce VP-16 phenoxyl radicals. Three systems were used to evaluate the contribution of thiol-dependent reduction of VP-16 phenoxyl radicals: (1) K562 cell homogenates depleted or supplemented with glutathione (GSH) in vitro; (2) homogenates derived from K562 cells with a decreased level of endogenous thiols and GSH (using a specific inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine; BSO) and (3) homogenates derived from K562 cells with increased content of endogenous thiols as a result of treatment with cadmium chloride. Depletion of thiols in K562 cells or cell homogenates proportionally decreased the ability of homogenates to reduce VP-16 phenoxyl radicals. Similarly, depletion or supplementation of K562 cells or cell homogenates with GSH proportionally decreased or increased the ability to reduce VP-16 phenoxyl radicals. Reduction of VP-16 phenoxyl radicals by K562 cell homogenates was similar to that obtained from cell homogenates isolated from K/VP.5 cells, a VP-16 resistant cell line derived from K562 cells. Elevation of endogenous thiols by cadmium chloride increased the ability of homogenates to reduce VP-16 phenoxyl radicals but did not reveal any significant difference in the ability of the two types of cells to interact with VP-16 radicals. Finally, BSO treatment of K562 cells led to potentiation of VP-16-induced DNA damage and to an increase in VP-16-induced growth inhibition, suggesting that, in the absence of ascorbate, modulation of endogenous thiols may be an important factor determining the oxidative metabolism and cytotoxic activity of VP-16 in tumour cells.","['Yalowich, J C', 'Tyurina, Y Y', 'Tyurin, V A', 'Allan, W P', 'Kagan, V E']","['Yalowich JC', 'Tyurina YY', 'Tyurin VA', 'Allan WP', 'Kagan VE']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15238, USA; Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15238, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,,,1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['1995/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]']","['0887-2333(95)00106-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0887-2333(95)00106-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 1996 Feb;10(1):59-68. doi: 10.1016/0887-2333(95)00106-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chromosomal rearrangement is often unstable with frequent recombinations and may be accompanied by either loss or amplification of genetic material[1]. Considering that ring chromosomes are rare in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), it is difficult to risk stratify patient prognosis, particularly when the ring chromosome occurs as the sole abnormality. Here we report a case of a ring chromosome 18 abnormality in a patient with newly diagnosed AML with monocytic differentiation. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated 46, XY, r(18)(p11q21) karyotype in 19 of 34 evaluated metaphase cells. The patient received induction chemotherapy and subsequent allogeneic cord blood transplant from a sex-matched donor, and remained in hematologic and cytogenetic remission for 120 days post transplant. Soon after, he developed post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and died of multi-organ failure. Although r(18) chromosomal abnormalities were not classified in the recent updated evidence-and expert opinion-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AML (likely due to the small number of reported cases), the patient was treated as high risk with stem cell transplantation. This was based on the unstable nature of the ring chromosome and the poor outcomes described in the literature of patients with sole ring 18 abnormalities.","['Sivendran, Shanthi', 'Gruenstein, Stephen', 'Malone, Adriana K', 'Najfeld, Vesna']","['Sivendran S', 'Gruenstein S', 'Malone AK', 'Najfeld V']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Tisch Cancer Institute, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100722,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', '*Ring Chromosomes', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/07/24 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-3-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-3-25 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2010 Jul 22;3:25. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-3-25.,,,,PMC2917391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of LRP16 in carcinoma was obviously higher than that in normal breast tissue. LRP16 protein expression was found in 27.6% (21/76) of carcinoma at stage I and II, and 50.0% (12/24) of carcinoma at stage III and IV.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the infectious etiology of fever in neutropenic patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective chart review of all medical records of febrile neutropenic patients hospitalized at Department of Medicine between January 1 and December 31, 2006 in accompanying with microbiologic, radiologic, and serologic results was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 125 patients (61 males and 64 females) and 172 episodes of febrile neutropenia with a mean age of 46.5 +/- 18.5 years (range: 15-81 years). The three most common primary diseases associated with neutropenia were acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36.6%, 33.1%, and 10.5%). Infections could be documented microbiologically and clinically in 84 episodes (48.8%), and primary bacteremia or fungemia was the most common cause of infection (40.5%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated pathogens (63.9%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (29.9%) and fungi (6.2%). Escherichia coli (46.8%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (27.6%) were the most common isolates among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Among 53 episodes (30.8%) of bloodstream infections, Gram-negative bacteria were the most commonly isolated pathogens (38 episodes, 71.7%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (19 episodes, 35.8%) and Candida tropicalis (1 episode, 1.9%). Surprisingly, invasive mold infections were noted in eight episodes (5, 1, and 2 episodes of proven, probable, and possible infections, respectively). The overall mortality was 19.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Although Gram-negative bacteria are the most common etiology of fever in neutropenic patients, the occurrence of infections caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and molds has been increasing in comparison with the observations from previous studies in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. To authors knowledge, the present study is the first in Thailand to determine the occurrence of invasive fungal infections using the standard criteria recommended by EORTC/MSG.","['Roongpoovapatr, Pitiya', 'Suankratay, Chusana']","['Roongpoovapatr P', 'Suankratay C']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross Infection/etiology/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology/microbiology', 'Fungi/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/24 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/07/24 06:00'],"['2010/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2010 Jul;93(7):776-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the contribution of the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene locus, one of the major targets of Bmi1, to stem cell expansion and cancer initiation. Bmi1(-/-) Delta-like protein (Dlk)(+) hepatic stem/progenitor cells showed de-repression of the Ink4a/Arf locus and displayed impaired growth activity. In contrast, Ink4a/Arf(-/-) Dlk(+) cells gave rise to considerably larger colonies containing a greater number of bipotent cells than wild-type Dlk(+) cells. Although Ink4a/Arf(-/-) Dlk(+) cells did not initiate tumors in recipient nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, enforced expression of Bmi1 in Ink4a/Arf(-/-) Dlk(+) cells further augmented their self-renewal capacity and resulted in tumor formation in vivo. Microarray analyses successfully identified five down-regulated genes as candidate downstream targets for Bmi1 in hepatic stem/progenitor cells. Of these genes, enforced expression of sex determining region Y-box 17 (Sox17) in Dlk(+) cells strongly suppressed colony propagation and tumor growth. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that repression of targets of Bmi1 other than the Ink4a/Arf locus plays a crucial role in the oncogenic transformation of hepatic stem/progenitor cells. Functional analyses of Bmi1 target genes would be of importance to elucidate the molecular machinery underlying hepatic stem cell system and explore therapeutic approaches for the eradication of liver cancer stem cells.","['Chiba, Tetsuhiro', 'Seki, Atsuyoshi', 'Aoki, Ryutaro', 'Ichikawa, Hitoshi', 'Negishi, Masamitsu', 'Miyagi, Satoru', 'Oguro, Hideyuki', 'Saraya, Atsunori', 'Kamiya, Akihide', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Yokosuka, Osamu', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Chiba T', 'Seki A', 'Aoki R', 'Ichikawa H', 'Negishi M', 'Miyagi S', 'Oguro H', 'Saraya A', 'Kamiya A', 'Nakauchi H', 'Yokosuka O', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (HMGB Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOXF Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox17 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'HMGB Proteins/metabolism', 'Liver/*embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Animal', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.23793 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2010 Sep;52(3):1111-23. doi: 10.1002/hep.23793.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though cytoreductive conditioning regimens vary in intensity, all clinically used protocols invariably cause side effects that compromise transiently or long-term the response of the natural and the adaptive immune systems. However, in the context of the reconstruction of immunity, the generation of naive T cells constitutes a slow process, and requires a functionally competent thymus. Unfortunately, regular thymic function is frequently suppressed by transplant-related toxicities. Most notably, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) causes a state of posttransplantation immune deficiency. Here we discuss preclinical allogeneic HSCT models and clinical observations that have contributed to a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the thymic dysfunction caused by acute GVHD. An in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms that control regular thymopoiesis and, conversely, affect thymus function is expected to provide the factual basis for the design of innovative therapies to recover T-cell numbers and function following allogeneic HSCT.","['Krenger, Werner', 'Hollander, Georg A']","['Krenger W', 'Hollander GA']","[""Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, and Basel University Children's Hospital (UKBB), Basel, Switzerland. werner.krenger@unibas.ch""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100719,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,['126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)'],IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/drug effects/immunology', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7/pharmacology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects/immunology', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Regeneration/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['smw-12666 [pii]', '10.4414/smw.2010.13051 [doi]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2010 Jul 19;140:w13051. doi: 10.4414/smw.2010.13051. eCollection 2010.,,,['R0I-A1057477-01/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A web-based survey of Australian and New Zealand intensive care doctors measuring demographics, details of recent triage decisions and attitudes towards various triage scenarios. RESULTS: A total of 238 responses were obtained (32.6% response rate). The mean number of triage decisions was 6.3 per clinician per week in New Zealand (95%CI 4.6-8.0) and 8.5 per week in Australia (95% CI 6.6-10.4) (test for difference in means, p=0.08).

Here, we investigated the ability of quercetin to sensitise primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to death receptor (DR) agonists, recombinant TNF-related-apoptosis-inducing ligand (rTRAIL) and anti-CD95, and to fludarabine, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug against CLL. METHODS: Peripheral white blood cells were isolated from patients and incubated with medium containing 50 ng ml anti-CD95 agonist antibody; 10 ng ml recombinant TRAIL; 10-25 microM quercetin and 3.5-14 microM fludarabine. Neutral Red assay was used to measure cell viability, where as apoptosis was assessed by determining caspase-3 activity, exposure to Annexin V and PARP fragmentation. RESULTS: Quercetin significantly enhanced anti-CD95- and rTRAIL-induced cell death as shown by decreased cell viability, increased caspase-3 and -9 activities, and positivity to Annexin V. In addition, association of quercetin with fludarabine increases the apoptotic response in CLL cells of about two-fold compared with quercetin monotreatment. CONCLUSION: This work shows that resistance to DR- and fludarabine-induced cell death in leukaemic cells isolated from CLL patients can be ameliorated or bypassed by the combined treatment with quercetin. Considering the low toxicity of the molecule, our study results are in favour of a potential use of quercetin in adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with other drugs.","['Russo, M', 'Spagnuolo, C', 'Volpe, S', 'Mupo, A', 'Tedesco, I', 'Russo, G-L']","['Russo M', 'Spagnuolo C', 'Volpe S', 'Mupo A', 'Tedesco I', 'Russo GL']","['Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino 83100, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100720,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Male', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Death Domain/*agonists', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives', 'fas Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['6605794 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605794 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Aug 24;103(5):642-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605794.

XMRV is classified as a gammaretrovirus, belonging to the same broad family as HIV, but more closely related to a group of viruses that cause cancers such as leukaemia. XMRV is the first member of the gammaretrovirus genus of retroviruses to be found in humans; the research to fully understand the connection between ME/CFS and XMRV, as well as what it means to have the virus, is ongoing.

There is also ample evidence showing that MYB is leukemogenic in several animal species.

In a recent study, a novel mechanism of activation of MYB involving gene fusion was identified in carcinomas of the breast and head and neck. A t(6;9) translocation was shown to generate fusions between MYB and the transcription factor gene NFIB. The fusions consistently result in loss of the 3'-end of MYB, including several highly conserved target sites for microRNAs that negatively regulate MYB expression. Deletion of these target sites may disrupt the repression of MYB, leading to overexpression of MYB-NFIB transcripts and protein and to transcriptional activation of critical MYB target genes associated with apoptosis, cell cycle control, cell growth/angiogenesis and cell adhesion. This study, together with previous and recent data showing rearrangements and copy number alterations of the MYB locus in T-cell leukemia and certain solid tumors, will be the main focus of this review.","['Stenman, Goran', 'Andersson, Mattias K', 'Andren, Ywonne']","['Stenman G', 'Andersson MK', 'Andren Y']","['Lundberg Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Pathology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. goran.stenman@llcr.med.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100828,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (MYB-NFIB fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['12515 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.15.12515 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Aug 1;9(15):2986-95. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.15.12515.

To further delineate these functions, we explored possible differences in DNA damage response caused by lack of MCL-1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). As expected, Mcl-1(-/-) MEFs had delayed Chk1 phosphorylation following etoposide treatment, compared to wild type MEFs. However, their response to hydroxyurea, which causes a G(1)/S checkpoint response, was not significantly different. In addition, appearance of gamma-H2AX was delayed in the Mcl-1(-/-) MEFs treated with etoposide. We next investigated whether MCL-1 is present, together with other DNA damage response proteins, at the sites of DNA damage. Immunoprecipitation of etoposide-treated extracts with anti-MCL-1 antibody showed association of MCL-1 with gamma-H2AX as well as NBS1. Immunofluorescent staining for MCL-1 further showed increased co-staining of MCL-1 and NBS1 following DNA damage. By using a system that creates DNA double strand breaks at specific sites in the genome, we demonstrated that MCL-1 is recruited directly adjacent to the sites of damage. Finally, in a direct demonstration of the importance of MCL-1 in allowing proper repair of DNA damage, we found that treatment for two brief exposures to etoposide , followed by periods of recovery, which mimics the clinical situation of etoposide use, resulted in greater accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities in the MEFs that lacked MCL-1. Together, these data indicate an important role for MCL-1 in coordinating DNA damage mediated checkpoint response, and have broad implications for the importance of MCL-1 in maintenance of genome integrity.","['Jamil, Sarwat', 'Stoica, Cezar', 'Hackett, Tillie-Louise', 'Duronio, Vincent']","['Jamil S', 'Stoica C', 'Hackett TL', 'Duronio V']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100711,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",2010/07/22 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['12354 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.14.12354 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Jul 15;9(14):2843-55. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.14.12354.

Following leukemic challenge, CLDC treatment inhibits tumor cell growth in vivo and extends survival, sometimes resulting in apparent eradication of tumor cells. CLDC induces multiple cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and intravenous treatment results in a more rapid and robust response than subcutaneous treatment. IFNgamma is induced in a dose-dependent manner, and tachyphylaxis results from repeated doses of CLDC. Tachyphylaxis of therapeutic effects is exacerbated at higher doses, thus the optimal survival benefits are seen at intermediate doses. Animals whose leukemia has been successfully treated with CLDC exhibit a survival advantage when faced with a secondary leukemic challenge, suggesting the existence of an adaptive anti-leukemic response. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of CLDC in multiple experimental leukemias and is consistent with a stimulation of a lasting TH(1) anti-leukemic immune response.","['Keasey, Nikki', 'Herse, Zachary', 'Chang, Stella', 'Liggitt, Denny H', 'Lay, Marla', 'Fairman, Jeffery', 'Claxton, David F']","['Keasey N', 'Herse Z', 'Chang S', 'Liggitt DH', 'Lay M', 'Fairman J', 'Claxton DF']","['Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100913,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipids)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cations/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2010/07/22 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['12653 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.10.6.12653 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Sep 15;10(6):625-31. doi: 10.4161/cbt.10.6.12653.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated PS 0-1 Japanese patients with measurable or assessable colorectal cancer who either had not received preliminary treatment, or were postoperative with metastasis and had undergone radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy before more than four weeks, and further had provided written acceptance of our proposed procedures. Twenty patients received modified FOLFIRI therapy as a 2-hour infusion of CPT-11 150 mg/m/2 and l-LV 200 mg/m2 followed by a bolus 5-FU 400 mg/m/2 and 46-hour infusion 5-FU 2, 400 mg/m2. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST and toxicity by NCI-CTC. RESULTS: Thirty males and seven females underwent an average 10 courses of treatment. This therapy achieved a 50% response rate, 80%disease-control rate, and 316+/-40 days PHS. Regarding hematological toxicity, 11 patients (55%) experienced leukemia, which developed to grade 3/4 in 5 (25%) of them. Twelve patients (65%) experienced neutropenia, which developed to grade 3/4 in 10 (50%) of them. Digestive toxicity was observed in 16 patients (80%), which developed to grade 3/4 in only one patient (5%) with gastric ulcer. Six patients (30%) experienced alopecia, which was grade 1/2 only.

Since the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the 1980s, the strategy for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has shifted from conventional chemotherapy to cell differentiation. The combination of ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy is currently the standard approach to treat newly-diagnosed APL. Multiple myeloma (MM) is also one of the major therapeutic targets in using molecular based technology. The recent availability of clinical data regarding thalidomide and lenalidomide has provided effective treatment options for patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM.

Hypoxia-response elements (HREs) are responsible for activating gene transcription in response to hypoxia. In this study, we constructed a hypoxia-response plasmid vector producing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), an anti-apoptotic factor. The hypoxia-response promoter was made by inserting tandem repeats of HREs upstream of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (HRE-CMV). HRE-CMV shbcl-2 vector consisted of bcl-2 shRNA under the control of HRE-CMV promoter. In hypoxic mouse rectum carcinoma cells (colon-26), the production of bcl-2 shRNA driven by HRE-CMV promoter was approximately 2-fold greater than that driven by CMV promoter. A single intratumoral (i.t.) injection of 40 microg HRE-CMV shbcl-2 to colon-26 tumor-bearing mice caused apoptotic cell death, and repetitive treatment with HRE-CMV shbcl-2 (40 microg/mouse, i.t.) also significantly suppressed the growth of colon-26 tumor cells implanted in mice. Apoptotic and anti-tumor effects were not observed in tumor-bearing mice treated with CMV shbcl-2. These results reveal the ability of HRE-CMV shbcl-2 vector to suppress the expression of bcl-2 in hypoxic tumor cells and suggest the usefulness of our constructed hypoxia-response plasmid vector to treat malignant tumors.

We observed reversion of the HTLV-1 mutants to the HTLV-1 wild-type genotype in none of the inoculated rabbits. In contrast, in macaques, the absence of HBZ was associated with reversion of the mutant virus to the wild-type genotype in 3 of the 4 animals within weeks from infection. Similarly, reversion to the wild type was observed in 2 of the 4 macaque inoculated with the p30 mutant.

These mice developed APL indistinguishable from wild-type PR, but with significantly reduced latency (median leukemia-free survival of 274 days vs 473 days for wild-type PR, P < .001). Resistance to proteolysis may increase the abundance of full-length PR protein in early myeloid cells, and our previous data suggested that noncleaved PR may be less toxic to early myeloid cells. Together, these effects appear to increase the leukemogenicity of NE-resistant PR, contrary to our previous prediction. We conclude that NE deficiency may reduce APL penetrance via indirect mechanisms that are still NE dependent.","['Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Lane, Andrew A', 'Welch, John S', 'Grieselhuber, Nicole R', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Uy GL', 'Lane AA', 'Welch JS', 'Grieselhuber NR', 'Payton JE', 'Ley TJ']","['Section of Stem Cell Biology, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

We report glucocorticoid resistance attributable to epigenetic silencing of the BIM gene in pediatric ALL biopsies and xenografts established in immune-deficient mice from direct patient explants as well as a therapeutic approach to reverse resistance in vivo. Glucocorticoid resistance in ALL xenografts was consistently associated with failure to up-regulate BIM expression after dexamethasone exposure despite confirmation of a functional glucocorticoid receptor. Although a comprehensive assessment of BIM CpG island methylation revealed no consistent changes, glucocorticoid resistance in xenografts and patient biopsies significantly correlated with decreased histone H3 acetylation. Moreover, the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat relieved BIM repression and exerted synergistic antileukemic efficacy with dexamethasone in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse glucocorticoid resistance and improve outcome for high-risk pediatric ALL.","['Bachmann, Petra S', 'Piazza, Rocco G', 'Janes, Mary E', 'Wong, Nicholas C', 'Davies, Carwyn', 'Mogavero, Angela', 'Bhadri, Vivek A', 'Szymanska, Barbara', 'Geninson, Greta', 'Magistroni, Vera', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Miranda-Saavedra, Diego', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Saffery, Richard', 'Craig, Jeffrey M', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Pimanda, John E', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Bachmann PS', 'Piazza RG', 'Janes ME', 'Wong NC', 'Davies C', 'Mogavero A', 'Bhadri VA', 'Szymanska B', 'Geninson G', 'Magistroni V', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Miranda-Saavedra D', 'Gottgens B', 'Saffery R', 'Craig JM', 'Marshall GM', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Pimanda JE', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100720,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Loci', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Vorinostat']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31229-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-284968 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):3013-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-284968.

Direct evaluations of adiposity and comparisons to contemporary controls that can differentiate recent trends in obesity from cancer-related treatments and sequelae are limited. METHODS: We evaluated demographic, treatment, lifestyle, and endocrine factors at the time of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry testing in 170 non-Hispanic white survivors and 71 sibling controls, and compared three measures of adiposity [body mass index (BMI), total body fat, and trunk fat]. For the survivors alone, we determined factors independently associated with BMI and body fat. RESULTS: Survivors were at 12 years since diagnosis; 58% had leukemia or lymphoma. BMI did not differ between groups. Among males, body fat was greater in survivors than in controls (25.8% versus 20.7%; P = 0.007), as was trunk fat (26.7% versus 21.3%; P = 0.008). Total or trunk fat did not differ among females. Cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and television viewing hours were higher among male survivors than in controls. Independent factors associated with higher BMI and total and trunk fat included any cranial radiation and television viewing hours, whereas prior treatment with cyclophosphamide was associated with lower BMI and body fat measures. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with siblings, male survivors have greater body fat and metabolic risks. Cranial irradiation and television hours are important risk factors for adiposity in pediatric cancer survivors. IMPACT: Pediatric cancer survivors should be carefully monitored for cardiovascular risk factors and sedentary lifestyles.","['Miller, Tracie L', 'Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Lopez-Mitnik, Gabriela', 'Hinkle, Andrea S', 'Constine, Louis S', 'Adams, M Jacob', 'French, Carol', 'Proukou, Cynthia', 'Rovitelli, Amy', 'Lipshultz, Steven E']","['Miller TL', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Lopez-Mitnik G', 'Hinkle AS', 'Constine LS', 'Adams MJ', 'French C', 'Proukou C', 'Rovitelli A', 'Lipshultz SE']","[""Batchelor Children's Research Institute, Division of Pediatric Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics (D820), Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33101, USA. tracie.miller@miami.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100720,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue', '*Adiposity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Siblings', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Whites', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-10-0163 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0163 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Aug;19(8):2013-22. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0163.

Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSV-host cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Additionally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.","['Munday, Diane C', 'Emmott, Edward', 'Surtees, Rebecca', 'Lardeau, Charles-Hugues', 'Wu, Weining', 'Duprex, W Paul', 'Dove, Brian K', 'Barr, John N', 'Hiscox, Julian A']","['Munday DC', 'Emmott E', 'Surtees R', 'Lardeau CH', 'Wu W', 'Duprex WP', 'Dove BK', 'Barr JN', 'Hiscox JA']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100720,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Proteome)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line/virology', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Pneumovirus Infections/*metabolism', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human/*chemistry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis']",2010/07/22 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)34502-3 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M110.001859 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2010 Nov;9(11):2438-59. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M110.001859.

Recently, it has been shown that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment for ATL, and that HTLV-1 Tax-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTL) contribute to the graft-versus-ATL effect. In the present study, we, for the first time, analyzed the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of isolated Tax(301-309) (SFHSLHLLF)-specific CTLs in HLA-A*2402(+) ATL patients before and after allo-HSCT by single-cell reverse transcription-PCR. The Tax(301-309)-specific CTLs in bone marrow and peripheral blood showed highly restricted oligoclonal diversity. In addition, a unique conserved amino acid motif of ""P-D/P-R"" in TCR-beta complementarity-determining region 3 in either BV7- or BV18-expressing CTLs was observed not only in all of the samples from ATL patients, but also in samples from the same patient before and after HSCT. Furthermore, the P-D/P-R motif-bearing CTL clones established from peripheral blood samples after HSCT exhibited strong killing activity against the HTLV-1-infected T cells of the patient. CTL clones were not established in vitro from samples prior to allo-HSCT. In addition, CTL clones with a strong killing activity were enriched in vivo after HSCT in the patient. Hence, Tax(301-309)-specific CTLs in ATL patients might have a preference for TCR construction and induce strong immune responses against the HTLV-1-infected T cells of patients, which contribute to the graft-versus-ATL effects after allo-HSCT. However, further analyses with a larger number of patients and more frequent sampling after allo-HSCT is required to confirm these findings.","['Tanaka, Yukie', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Yamazaki, Rie', 'Sato, Ken', 'Sato, Miki', 'Terasako, Kiriko', 'Kimura, Shun-ichi', 'Okuda, Shinya', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Oshima, Kumi', 'Tanihara, Aki', 'Nishida, Junji', 'Yoshikawa, Toshiaki', 'Nakatsura, Tetsuya', 'Sugiyama, Haruo', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Tanaka Y', 'Nakasone H', 'Yamazaki R', 'Sato K', 'Sato M', 'Terasako K', 'Kimura S', 'Okuda S', 'Kako S', 'Oshima K', 'Tanihara A', 'Nishida J', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Nakatsura T', 'Sugiyama H', 'Kanda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100720,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*24:02 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A24 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A24 Antigen', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/therapy/virology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/virology']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-0678 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0678 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;70(15):6181-92. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0678.

Depleting B-RAF or the prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 renders mutant B-RAF melanoma cells susceptible to anoikis. In this study, we examined the effect of targeting B-RAF on the survival of primary stage melanoma cells cultured in three-dimensional type I collagen gels, which partially mimics the dermal microenvironment. Depletion/inhibition of B-RAF with small interfering RNA or the mutant B-RAF inhibitor, PLX4720, induced apoptosis of mutant B-RAF melanoma cells in three-dimensional collagen. Apoptosis was dependent on two upregulated BH3-only proteins, Bim-EL and Bmf, and was inhibited by ectopic Mcl-1 expression. Akt3 activation has been associated with the survival of melanoma cells. Mutant B-RAF melanoma cells ectopically expressing a constitutively activated form of Akt3 or endogenously expressing mutant Akt3 were protected from apoptosis induced by B-RAF knockdown or PLX4720 treatment. Furthermore, intrinsically resistant metastatic melanoma cells displayed elevated Akt phosphorylation in three-dimensional collagen and were rendered susceptible to PLX4720 by Akt3 knockdown. Importantly, myristylated Akt3 prevented B-RAF targeting-induced upregulation of Bim-EL and Bmf in three-dimensional collagen and partially protected Mcl-1-depleted cells from apoptosis. These findings delineate how mutant B-RAF protects melanoma cells from apoptosis and provide insight into possible resistance mechanisms to B-RAF inhibitors.","['Shao, Yongping', 'Aplin, Andrew E']","['Shao Y', 'Aplin AE']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100720,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BMF protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PLX 4720)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-4471 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4471 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 15;70(16):6670-81. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4471.

Further investigation with human K562 leukemia cells found that SM could induce an early lysosomal rupture within 2h as assessed by acridine-orange relocation and alkalinization of lysosomes. Intracellular lysosomal rupture is also confirmed with the release of cathepsin B to cytosol detected by western blot. Subsequent mitochondrial damage including mitochondrial membrane permeabilization detected by decrease membrane potential as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was also observed. The cellular Ca(2+) overload is more pronounced in SM-treated cells. Cells exposed to 10 microM SM for 30 min showed a maximum 7-fold increase in intracellular calcium concentration compared with vehicle-treated controls. The down-expression of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities followed by above changes revealed that the cytotoxicity of SM was involved in a lysosomal-mitochondrial death pathway induced by SM.","['Sun, Lingmei', 'Zhao, Ying', 'Li, Xia', 'Yuan, Huiqing', 'Cheng, Aixia', 'Lou, Hongxiang']","['Sun L', 'Zhao Y', 'Li X', 'Yuan H', 'Cheng A', 'Lou H']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100718,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Solanaceous Alkaloids)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3671-38-3 (beta-solamarine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cathepsin B/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Solanaceous Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(10)00174-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2010.07.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Sep;24(6):1504-11. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2010.07.013.

Runx1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor implicated in hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and leukemogenesis, contains IRES sequences in the 5' untranslated region. To clarify the roles of the IRES element in Runx1 function, we generated knock-in mice for either wild-type Runx1 or Runx1/Evi1, a Runx1 fusion protein identified in human leukemia. In both cases, native promoter-dependent transcription was retained, whereas IRES-mediated translation was eliminated. Interestingly, homozygotes expressing wild-type Runx1 deleted for the IRES element (Runx1(Delta IRES/Delta IRES)) died in utero with prominent dilatation of peripheral blood vessels due to impaired pericyte development. In addition, hematopoietic cells in the Runx1(Delta IRES/Delta IRES) fetal liver were significantly decreased, and exhibited an altered differentiation pattern, a reduced proliferative activity, and an impaired reconstitution ability. On the other hand, heterozygotes expressing Runx1/Evi1 deleted for the IRES element (Runx1(+/RE Delta IRES)) were born normally and did not show any hematological abnormalities, in contrast that conventional Runx1/Evi1 heterozygotes die in utero with central nervous system hemorrhage and Runx1/Evi1 chimeric mice develop acute leukemia. The findings reported here demonstrate the essential roles of the IRES element in Runx1 function under physiological and pathological conditions.","['Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Htun, Phyo Wai', 'Ma, Feng', 'Miyazaki, Kazuko', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Kanno, Masamoto', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Honda, Zen-ichiro', 'Okuda, Tsukasa', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Tsuji, Kohichiro', 'Honda, Hiroaki']","['Nagamachi A', 'Htun PW', 'Ma F', 'Miyazaki K', 'Yamasaki N', 'Kanno M', 'Inaba T', 'Honda Z', 'Okuda T', 'Oda H', 'Tsuji K', 'Honda H']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100718,United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"[""*5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/metabolism']",2010/07/22 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2009/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0012-1606(10)00946-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.07.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2010 Sep 15;345(2):226-36. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.07.015.

METHODS: (1) HCE1/MCS was obtained using liquid overlay and rotating technique. (2) Four groups were established (MG132 group, cisplatin group, MG132+cisplatin group, the control group). Cell viability were measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. (3) The expression of nuclear factor (NF) kappaB of both HCE1 monolayer cells (HCE1/MC) and HCE1/MCS was detected by western blot, and the expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2) was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: (1) HCE1/MCS was established successfully.

Cultured K562/Adriamycin (ADM) cells were treated with HSS at 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL, respectively. The apoptosis and expression of p-glycoprotein was evaluated by flow cytometry. Expressions of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were also evaluated. There was a significant dose-dependent increase in the apoptosis in the HSS treated K562/ADM cells (P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). The p-glycoprotein expression in the 40 microg/mL HSS group (14.8%) was lower than in the control (16.9%, P < 0.05) and the 10 microg/mL HSS group (7.3%, P < 0.05), but it was similar to the HSS 20 microg/mL group (10.7%, P > 0.05). The expressions of apoptosis-stimulating protein caspase-3 protein were increased, whereas the expressions of apoptosis-suppressing Bcl-2 were decreased in the HSS groups, as compared with the levels in the control group (P < 0.05). We conclude that HSS induces apoptosis of the Adriamycin-resistant K562/ADM cells. The enhanced expressions in caspase-3 and the reduced expressions in Bcl-2 protein may have contributed to the apoptosis-stimulating effect of HSS. The inhibition of p-glycoprotein suggests that HSS may diminish the resistance to Adriamycin and potentially enhance the therapeutic effects.","['Li, Guang-Yao', 'Liu, Ji-Zhu', 'Chen, Shou-Guo', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Wang, Chun-Bo', 'Wang, Le-Xin']","['Li GY', 'Liu JZ', 'Chen SG', 'Zhang B', 'Wang CB', 'Wang LX']","[""Liaocheng People's Hospital (Liaocheng Clinical School of Taishan Medical University), Liaocheng Shandong, 252000, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Albumins)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (haishengsu)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Albumins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Pilot Projects', 'Shellfish']",2010/07/22 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2010/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880200903176620 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2010 May;48(5):529-33. doi: 10.3109/13880200903176620.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previously published series of MDS and AML cases, which had lost this region via unbalanced translocation, around 40% of cases were shown to have additional copies of the chromosome 20 abnormalities, with resulting gain or amplification of the retained parts of chromosome 20, most often 20q11.2. We have used FISH and array comparative genomic hybridization, to define further the retained and amplified regions. We now report targeted amplification of 20q11.21 in four of the 22 cases selected for further study and in one new case. The shortest amplified region of 250 kb in a series of five patients with three to ten copies of the 20q11.21 region contained the complete HCK, TM9SF4, PLAGL2, and POFUT1 genes. By RT-PCR we have shown that there is correlation between amplification and increased expression of these four genes in most cases. Localized and high level amplification of the common 250 kb region is evidence for activation of an oncogene in this region in these MDS and AML cases. Cases with 20q11.21 amplification tended to have a high proportion of erythroblasts in the marrow, with two cases diagnosed as erythroleukemia (AML-M6). Chromosome sub-band 20q11.21 amplification may therefore prove to be a marker of a specific subset of AML/MDS with a significant erythroid component.","['Mackinnon, Ruth N', 'Selan, Carly', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Baker, Elizabeth', 'Nandurkar, Harshal', 'Campbell, Lynda J']","['Mackinnon RN', 'Selan C', 'Wall M', 'Baker E', 'Nandurkar H', 'Campbell LJ']","[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. ruth.mackinnon@svhm.org.au""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/07/21 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20806 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Nov;49(11):998-1013. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20806.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the past few years, the concept of tumor stem cells has gained widespread acceptance. The cancer stem cell (CSC) model is based on the observation that continuous growth of tumors depends on a small population of immature neoplastic cells with unlimited proliferative potential. In contrast to these CSC, more mature clonal cells in the same neoplasm undergo apoptosis and die after a variable number of cell divisions. The self-renewal capacity of CSC plays a central role in this scenario and enables permanent tumor cell repopulation in vivo in patients as well as in experimental animals, e.g., immunodeficient mice. Based on the stem cell concept, it is clear that the success of an anti-neoplastic approach depends on efficient targeting and elimination of CSC. An important aspect of CSC is their intrinsic resistance against conventional drugs. Therefore, a major focus in current research is molecular targets and their expression in CSC, with the goal to use targeted drugs for CSC elimination. It is the hope for the future that therapeutic approaches involving CSC-targeting concepts will lead to sustained remission and thus improvement of prognosis in leukemia and cancer patients.","['Karlic, Heidrun', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Schulenburg, Axel', 'Grunt, Thomas W', 'Laffer, Sylvia', 'Mirkina, Irina', 'Hubmann, Rainer', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Marian, Brigitte', 'Selzer, Edgar', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Pittermann, Elisabeth', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Pehamberger, Hubert', 'Zielinski, Christoph', 'Valent, Peter']","['Karlic H', 'Herrmann H', 'Schulenburg A', 'Grunt TW', 'Laffer S', 'Mirkina I', 'Hubmann R', 'Shehata M', 'Marian B', 'Selzer E', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Pittermann E', 'Jager U', 'Pehamberger H', 'Zielinski C', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology (LBI for Leukemia Research), Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria. heidrun.karlic@meduniwien.ac.at']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20100722,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2010/07/21 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00508-010-1408-z [doi]'],ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2010 Jul;122(13-14):423-36. doi: 10.1007/s00508-010-1408-z.

The correlations of imatinib (400 mg) trough plasma concentrations (C(mins)) with the patients' characteristics and responses were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall mean (+/-SD, CV%) steady-state C(mins) for imatinib at 400 mg (n=36) and 600 mg (n=10) daily was 1325.61 ng/mL (+/-583.53 ng/mL; 44%) and 1550.90 ng/mL (+/-462.63 ng/mL; 30%), respectively, and no statistically significant differences were found between them (P=0.267). At 400 mg daily, female patients had significantly higher C(mins) than the male patients (P=0.048), and molecular responses were not correlated with imatinib C(mins), but they were correlated with time elapsed before imatinib therapy.

Calpains play crucial roles in many physiological processes, including signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, regulation of gene expression, apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Calpains have been implicated in many pathologies including muscular dystrophies, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Calpain regulation is complex and incompletely understood. mRNA and protein levels correlate poorly with activity, limiting the use of gene or protein expression techniques to measure calpain activity. This video protocol details a flow cytometric assay developed in our laboratory for measuring calpain activity in fixed and living cells. This method uses the fluorescent substrate BOC-LM-CMAC, which is cleaved specifically by calpain, to measure calpain activity. In this video, calpain activity in fixed and living murine 32 Dkit leukemia cells, alone or as part of a splenocyte population is measured using an LSRII (BD Bioscience). 32 Dkit cells are shown to have elevated activity compared to normal splenocytes.","['Farr, Christina', 'Berger, Stuart']","['Farr C', 'Berger S']","['Immunology, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20100708,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (PD 150606)', '0 (t-BOC-leucine-methionine amide-CMAC)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,"['Acrylates/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calpain/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coumarins/chemistry', 'Dipeptides/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology/enzymology']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['2050 [pii]', '10.3791/2050 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2010 Jul 8;(41). pii: 2050. doi: 10.3791/2050.,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3156068,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prominently featured in recruitment are the protein domains that bind to specific histone modifications. One such domain is the plant homeodomain (PHD), found in several chromatin-binding proteins. The epigenetic factor RBP2 has multiple PHD domains, however, they have different functions (Figure 4). In particular, the C-terminal PHD domain, found in a RBP2 oncogenic fusion in human leukemia, binds to trimethylated lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3). The transcript corresponding to the RBP2 isoform containing the C-terminal PHD accumulates during differentiation of promonocytic, lymphoma-derived, U937 cells into monocytes. Consistent with both sets of data, genome-wide analysis showed that in differentiated U937 cells, the RBP2 protein gets localized to genomic regions highly enriched for H3K4me3. Localization of RBP2 to its targets correlates with a decrease in H3K4me3 due to RBP2 histone demethylase activity and a decrease in transcriptional activity. In contrast, two other PHDs of RBP2 are unable to bind H3K4me3. Notably, the C-terminal domain PHD of RBP2 is absent in the smaller RBP2 isoform. It is conceivable that the small isoform of RBP2, which lacks interaction with H3K4me3, differs from the larger isoform in genomic location. The difference in genomic location of RBP2 isoforms may account for the observed diversity in RBP2 function. Specifically, RBP2 is a critical player in cellular differentiation mediated by the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Consistent with these data, previous genome-wide analysis, without distinction between isoforms, identified two distinct groups of RBP2 target genes: 1) genes bound by RBP2 in a manner that is independent of differentiation; 2) genes bound by RBP2 in a differentiation-dependent manner. To identify differences in localization between the isoforms we performed genome-wide location analysis by ChIP-Seq. Using antibodies that detect both RBP2 isoforms we have located all RBP2 targets. Additionally we have antibodies that only bind large, and not small RBP2 isoform (Figure 4). After identifying the large isoform targets, one can then subtract them from all RBP2 targets to reveal the targets of small isoform. These data show the contribution of chromatin-interacting domain in protein recruitment to its binding sites in the genome.","['Beshiri, Michael L', 'Islam, Abul', 'DeWaal, Dannielle C', 'Richter, William F', 'Love, Jennifer', 'Lopez-Bigas, Nuria', 'Benevolenskaya, Elizaveta V']","['Beshiri ML', 'Islam A', 'DeWaal DC', 'Richter WF', 'Love J', 'Lopez-Bigas N', 'Benevolenskaya EV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois Chicago - UIC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20100707,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (RBP2 protein, human)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular)']",IM,"['Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/*methods', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['2101 [pii]', '10.3791/2101 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2010 Jul 7;(41). pii: 2101. doi: 10.3791/2101.,,,"['R01 CA138631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3156076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with low/intermediate risk received remission at 3 anthracycline-based consolidation courses, whereas high-risk patients received the same schedule as in the previous, non-risk-adapted AIDA-0493 trial including cytarabine. In addition, all patients in the AIDA-2000 received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 15 days during each consolidation. After induction, 600 of 636 (94.3%) and 420 of 445 (94.4%) patients achieved complete remission in the AIDA-0493 and AIDA-2000, respectively. The 6-year overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates were 78.1% versus 87.4% (P = .001) and 27.7% versus 10.7% (P < .0001). Significantly lower CIR rates for patients in the AIDA-2000 were most evident in the high-risk group (49.7% vs 9.3%, respectively, P < .0001). Our data confirm that anthracycline-based consolidation is at least equally effective as cytarabine-containing regimens for low-/intermediate-risk patients and suggest that a risk-adapted strategy including ATRA for consolidation improves outcome in newly diagnosed APL. Furthermore, our results highlight the role of cytarabine coupled to anthracyclines and ATRA during consolidation in the high-risk group.","['Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Gallo, Eugenio', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Fioritoni, Giuseppe', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Cimino, Giuseppe', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Peta, Antonio', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Carella, Angelo M', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Pogliani, Enrico M', 'Petti, Maria C', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Lo-Coco F', 'Avvisati G', 'Vignetti M', 'Breccia M', 'Gallo E', 'Rambaldi A', 'Paoloni F', 'Fioritoni G', 'Ferrara F', 'Specchia G', 'Cimino G', 'Diverio D', 'Borlenghi E', 'Martinelli G', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Di Bona E', 'Fazi P', 'Peta A', 'Bosi A', 'Carella AM', 'Fabbiano F', 'Pogliani EM', 'Petti MC', 'Amadori S', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Biopathology, University Tor Vergata of Rome, Via Montpellier 1, Rome, Italy. francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31181-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-276196 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 28;116(17):3171-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-276196.

From these screens, we identified ivermectin, a derivative of avermectin B1 that is licensed for the treatment of the parasitic infections, strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, but is also effective against other worm infestations. As a potential antileukemic agent, ivermectin induced cell death at low micromolar concentrations in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples preferentially over normal hematopoietic cells. Ivermectin also delayed tumor growth in 3 independent mouse models of leukemia at concentrations that appear pharmacologically achievable. As an antiparasitic, ivermectin binds and activates chloride ion channels in nematodes, so we tested the effects of ivermectin on chloride flux in leukemia cells. Ivermectin increased intracellular chloride ion concentrations and cell size in leukemia cells. Chloride influx was accompanied by plasma membrane hyperpolarization, but did not change mitochondrial membrane potential. Ivermectin also increased reactive oxygen species generation that was functionally important for ivermectin-induced cell death. Finally, ivermectin synergized with cytarabine and daunorubicin that also increase reactive oxygen species production. Thus, given its known toxicology and pharmacology, ivermectin could be rapidly advanced into clinical trial for leukemia.","['Sharmeen, Sumaiya', 'Skrtic, Marko', 'Sukhai, Mahadeo A', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Fonseca, Sonali B', 'Sun, Hong', 'Wood, Tabitha E', 'Ward, Richard', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Batey, Robert A', 'Datti, Alessandro', 'Wrana, Jeff', 'Kelley, Shana O', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Sharmeen S', 'Skrtic M', 'Sukhai MA', 'Hurren R', 'Gronda M', 'Wang X', 'Fonseca SB', 'Sun H', 'Wood TE', 'Ward R', 'Minden MD', 'Batey RA', 'Datti A', 'Wrana J', 'Kelley SO', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiparasitic Agents)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '70288-86-7 (Ivermectin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antiparasitic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ivermectin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31156-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-262675 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 4;116(18):3593-603. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-262675.

Thus far, data on a comprehensive cytogenetic or molecular genetic characterization are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Here, we analyzed 81 thoroughly characterized patients with CMML (CMML type 1, n = 45; CMML type 2, n = 36) by applying next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to investigate CBL, JAK2, MPL, NRAS, and KRAS at known mutational hotspot regions. In addition, complete coding regions were analyzed for RUNX1 (beta isoform) and TET2 aberrations. RESULTS: Cytogenetic aberrations were found in 18.2% of patients (14 of 77 patients). In contrast, at least one molecular mutation was observed in 72.8% of patients (59 of 81 patients). A mean of 1.6 mutations per patient was observed by this unprecedented screening. In total, 105 variances were detected by this comprehensive molecular screening. After excluding known polymorphisms or silent mutations, 82 distinct mutations remained (CBL, n = 15; JAK2V617F, n = 8; MPL, n = 0; NRAS, n = 10; KRAS, n = 12; RUNX1, n = 7; and TET2, n = 41). With respect to clinical data, a better outcome was seen for patients carrying TET2 mutations (P = .013). CONCLUSION: The number of molecular markers used to categorize myeloid neoplasms is constantly increasing. Here, NGS screening has been demonstrated to support a comprehensive characterization of the molecular background in CMML. A pattern of molecular mutations translates into different biologic and prognostic categories of CMML.","['Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Grossmann, Vera', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Schindela, Sonja', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Kazak, Beray', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kohlmann A', 'Grossmann V', 'Klein HU', 'Schindela S', 'Weiss T', 'Kazak B', 'Dicker F', 'Schnittger S', 'Dugas M', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munchen, Germany. alexander.kohlmann@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.27.1361 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.27.1361 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 20;28(24):3858-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.1361.

The concern remained about the long-term outcome of this well-tolerated regimen. We report our long-term follow-up data on the same cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS From January 1998 to December 2004, 72 patients with PML/RARalpha+ APL were enrolled. All patients were treated with a single-agent ATO regimen. Results Overall 62 (86.1%) achieved a hematologic remission (complete remission). After the initial report, an additional seven patients have relapsed for a total of 13 relapses. There were no additional toxicities to report on follow-up. At a median follow-up 60 months, the 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate (+/- SE) of event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS) was 69% +/- 5.5%, 80% +/- 5.2%, and 74.2% +/- 5.2%, respectively. The OS in the good risk group as defined by us remains 100% over this period. CONCLUSION Single-agent ATO as used in this study in the management of newly diagnosed cases of APL is safe and is associated with durable responses. Results in the low-risk group are comparable to that reported with conventional therapy while additional interventions would probably be required in high-risk cases.","['Mathews, Vikram', 'George, Biju', 'Chendamarai, Ezhilarasi', 'Lakshmi, Kavitha M', 'Desire, Salamun', 'Balasubramanian, Poonkuzhali', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Thirugnanam, Rajashekar', 'Abraham, Aby', 'Shaji, Ramachandran Velayudhan', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'Chandy, Mammen']","['Mathews V', 'George B', 'Chendamarai E', 'Lakshmi KM', 'Desire S', 'Balasubramanian P', 'Viswabandya A', 'Thirugnanam R', 'Abraham A', 'Shaji RV', 'Srivastava A', 'Chandy M']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore 632004, India; vikram@cmcvellore.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20100719,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hair/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nails/metabolism', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.5031 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.5031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 20;28(24):3866-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.5031.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from diagnostic lymphoblasts from 47 children with T-ALL treated on Children's Oncology Group Study P9404 or Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Protocol 00-01. These samples represented nine patients who did not achieve an initial complete remission, 13 who relapsed, and 25 who became long-term, event-free survivors. The findings were confirmed in an independent cohort of patients by quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction (DNA-PCR), an assay that is well suited for clinical application. RESULTS: Analysis of the CGH findings in patients in whom induction chemotherapy failed compared with those in whom induction chemotherapy was successful identified the absence of biallelic TCRgamma locus deletion (ABD), a characteristic of early thymocyte precursors before V(D)J recombination, as the most robust predictor of induction failure (P < .001). This feature was also associated with markedly inferior event-free (P = .002) and overall survival (P < .001) rates: 25% versus 58% and 25% versus 72%, respectively. Using a rapid and inexpensive quantitative DNA-PCR assay, we validated ABD as a predictor of a poor response to induction chemotherapy in an independent series of patients. CONCLUSION: Lymphoblasts from children with T-ALL should be evaluated at diagnosis for deletion within the TCRgamma locus. Patients lacking biallelic deletion, which confers a high probability of induction failure with contemporary therapy, should be assigned to alternative therapy in the context of a prospective clinical trial.","['Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Grebliunaite, Ruta', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Protopopov, Alexei', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Kutok, Jeffery', 'Larson, Richard S', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Chin, Lynda', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Gutierrez A', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Zhang J', 'Grebliunaite R', 'Sanda T', 'Protopopov A', 'Tosello V', 'Kutok J', 'Larson RS', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Loh ML', 'Ferrando AA', 'Winter SS', 'Mullighan CG', 'Silverman LB', 'Chin L', 'Hunger SP', 'Sallan SE', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.3390 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.3390 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 20;28(24):3816-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.3390.

Recent data suggest that RIBE may be epigenetically mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small regulatory molecules that target messenger RNA transcripts for translational inhibition. Here, we analyzed microRNAome changes in bystander tissues after alpha-particle microbeam irradiation of three-dimensional artificial human tissues using miRNA microarrays. Our results indicate that IR leads to a deregulation of miRNA expression in bystander tissues. We report that major bystander end points, including apoptosis, cell cycle deregulation and DNA hypomethylation, may be mediated by altered expression of miRNAs. Specifically, c-MYC-mediated upregulation of the miR-17 family was associated with decreased levels of E2F1 and RB1, suggesting a switch to a proliferative state in bystander tissues, while priming these cells for impending death signals. Upregulation of the miR-29 family resulted in decreased levels of its targets DNMT3a and MCL1, consequently affecting DNA methylation and apoptosis. Altered expression of miR-16 led to changes in expression of BCL2, suggesting modulation of apoptosis. Thus, our data clearly show that miRNAs play a profound role in the manifestation of late RIBE end points. In summary, this study creates a roadmap for understanding the role of microRNAome in RIBE and for developing novel RIBE biomarkers.","['Kovalchuk, Olga', 'Zemp, Franz J', 'Filkowski, Jody N', 'Altamirano, Alvin M', 'Dickey, Jennifer S', 'Jenkins-Baker, Gloria', 'Marino, Stephen A', 'Brenner, David J', 'Bonner, William M', 'Sedelnikova, Olga A']","['Kovalchuk O', 'Zemp FJ', 'Filkowski JN', 'Altamirano AM', 'Dickey JS', 'Jenkins-Baker G', 'Marino SA', 'Brenner DJ', 'Bonner WM', 'Sedelnikova OA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Lethbridge, 4401 University Drive, Lethbridge, Alberta, T1K 3M4 Canada. olga.kovalchuk@uleth.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Bystander Effect/*radiation effects', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq119 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq119 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Oct;31(10):1882-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq119.

METHODS: We followed 26,692 children who were born after IVF during the years 1982-2005 by using the Swedish Cancer Register and compared the number of children who had cancer and were born after IVF with children who were not conceived by IVF. Adjustment was made for year of birth. RESULTS: Maternal age, parity, smoking, subfertility, previous miscarriages, BMI, and multiple births did not significantly affect cancer risk in offspring. High birth weight, premature delivery, and the presence of respiratory diagnoses and low Apgar score were risk factors for cancer. We identified 53 cases of cancer in children who were born after IVF against 38 expected cases: 18 of them with hematologic cancer (15 of them acute lymphoblastic leukemia), 17 with eye or central nervous system tumors, and 12 with other solid cancers. There were 6 cases of Langerhans histiocytosis against 1.0 expected. The total cancer risk estimate was 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: We found a moderately increased risk for cancer in children who were conceived by IVF.

We have quantified the spatiotemporal dynamics of the redistribution of immunoglobulin E-loaded receptors (IgE-FcepsilonRI) on rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast cells in contact with fluid and gel-phase membranes displaying ligands for immunoglobulin E, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. To clearly separate the kinetics of receptor redistribution from cell spreading, and to precisely define the initial contact time (+/-50 ms), micropipette cell manipulation was used to bring individual cells into contact with surfaces. On ligand-free surfaces, there are micron-scale heterogeneities in fluorescence that likely reflect regions of the cell that are more closely apposed to the substrate. When ligands are present, receptor clusters form with this same size scale. The initial rate of accumulation of receptors into the clusters is consistent with diffusion-limited trapping with D approximately 10(-1) microm2/s. These results support the hypothesis that clusters form by diffusion to cell-surface contact regions. Over longer timescales (>10 s), individual clusters moved with both diffusive and directed motion components. The dynamics of the cluster motion is similar to the dynamics of membrane fluctuations of cells on ligand-free fluid membranes. Thus, the same cellular machinery may be responsible for both processes.","['Spendier, Kathrin', 'Carroll-Portillo, Amanda', 'Lidke, Keith A', 'Wilson, Bridget S', 'Timlin, Jerilyn A', 'Thomas, James L']","['Spendier K', 'Carroll-Portillo A', 'Lidke KA', 'Wilson BS', 'Timlin JA', 'Thomas JL']","['Consortium of the Americas for Interdisciplinary Science, Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '2644-64-6 (1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine)', 'TE895536Y5 (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine)']",IM,"['1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-3495(10)00527-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bpj.2010.04.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2010 Jul 21;99(2):388-97. doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2010.04.029.,,,"['P50 GM085273/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI051575/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI051575-08/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2905106,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Biophysical Society.

This inversely correlates with in vivo CD34+ mobilization and, interestingly, also with the prognosis of the disease: patients showing a good mobilizing activity are resistant to chemotherapy and subject to significantly higher rates of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and relapse than the others. Based on its known role in patients' response to chemotherapy, we hypothesized an involvement of the Apoptotic Machinery (AM) in these phenotypic features. METHODS: To investigate the molecular bases of the differential chemosensitivity of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in CR AML patients, and the relationship between chemosensitivity, mobilizing activity and relapse rates, we analyzed their AM expression profile by performing Real Time RT-PCR of 84 AM genes in CD34+ pools from the two extreme classes of patients (i.e., chemoresistant and highly chemosensitive), and compared them with normal controls. RESULTS: The AM expression profiles of patients highlighted features that could satisfactorily explain their in vitro chemoresponsive phenotype: specifically, in chemoresistant patients we detected up regulation of antiapoptotic BIRC genes and down regulation of proapoptotic APAF1, FAS, FASL, TNFRSF25. Interestingly, our analysis of the AM network showed that the dysregulated genes in these patients are characterized by high network centrality (i.e., high values of betweenness, closeness, radiality, stress) and high involvement in drug response. CONCLUSIONS: AM genes represent critical nodes for the proper execution of cell death following pharmacological induction in patients. We propose that their dysregulation (either due to inborn or de novo genomic mutations selected by treatment) could cause a relapse in apparent CR AML patients. Based on this, AM profiling before chemotherapy and transplantation could identify patients with a predisposing genotype to MRD and relapse: accordingly, they should undergo a different, specifically tailored, therapeutic regimen and should be carefully checked during the post-treatment period.","['Ragusa, Marco', 'Avola, Giuseppe', 'Angelica, Rosario', 'Barbagallo, Davide', 'Guglielmino, Maria Rosa', 'Duro, Laura R', 'Majorana, Alessandra', 'Statello, Luisa', 'Salito, Loredana', 'Consoli, Carla', 'Camuglia, Maria Grazia', 'Di Pietro, Cinzia', 'Milone, Giuseppe', 'Purrello, Michele']","['Ragusa M', 'Avola G', 'Angelica R', 'Barbagallo D', 'Guglielmino MR', 'Duro LR', 'Majorana A', 'Statello L', 'Salito L', 'Consoli C', 'Camuglia MG', 'Di Pietro C', 'Milone G', 'Purrello M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze BioMediche, Unita di BioMedicina Molecolare Genomica e dei Sistemi Complessi, Genetica, Biologia Computazionale G Sichel, Via Santa Sofia 87, 95123 Catania, Italy, EU.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/07/21 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-377 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-377 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Jul 19;10:377. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-377.,,,,PMC2914706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of primary immunodeficiencies, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, bone marrow transplantation in patients aged over 20 years, chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia, and pediatric AIDS. IVIg has been used off-label for several diseases, clinical symptoms and syndromes. Our aim was to determine if there is evidence to support the efficacy of IVIg therapy in autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases (AMBDs). We searched the PubMed database for studies on pemphigus and pemphigoid using the following criteria: (i) English language; (ii) minimum of five patients; (iii) diagnosis based on histology and immunopathology; and (iv) statistical analysis of data for comparison of efficacy provided. We evaluated the data and present information on the number of participants in each study, pre-IVIg therapy, indications for the use of IVIg, IVIg protocol (dose and interval) used, concomitant therapies, clinical outcome, follow-up period, and serologic studies. The quality of the evidence presented in this review is at Level A according to the UK National Health Service criteria. Twenty-three studies that were published between May 1999 and April 2010 were identified. One randomized controlled trial was found and all other studies were case series. Data on 260 patients treated with IVIg were analyzed: 191 patients with pemphigus and 69 patients with pemphigoid. Overall, 245 patients showed improvement with IVIg therapy. IVIg demonstrated a corticosteroid-sparing effect. In the studies presented, the incidence of serious adverse effects was not significant. The best available evidence in the literature indicates that IVIg is efficacious and has a good safety profile in the treatment of AMBDs.","['Gurcan, Hakan M', 'Jeph, Sunil', 'Ahmed, A Razzaque']","['Gurcan HM', 'Jeph S', 'Ahmed AR']","['Center for Blistering Diseases, New England Baptist Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02120, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Am J Clin Dermatol,American journal of clinical dermatology,100895290,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Mucous Membrane/immunology/pathology', 'Pemphigoid, Bullous/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Pemphigus/*drug therapy/immunology']",2010/07/21 06:00,2010/11/09 06:00,['2010/07/21 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['3 [pii]', '10.2165/11533290-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Dermatol. 2010;11(5):315-26. doi: 10.2165/11533290-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renin is an enzyme produced in the kidneys, and it cleaves circulating angiotensinogen (a protein produced in the liver) to yield angiotensin I, an inactive decapeptide. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), found primarily in the lung, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, an active vasoconstrictor octapeptide. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, which promotes retention of sodium and water. ACE is also responsible for inactivating bradykinin, a vasodilator (5). RAS and angiotensin II also play a role in interstitial fibrosis, cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, and heart failure (6, 7). It has been shown that RAS operates in the heart, and an upregulation of this system is correlated to heart failure (8-10). Inhibition of ACE in patients with heart failure has often resulted in a favorable outcome for the patient (11), although individuals treated with ACE inhibitors have been reported to respond differently as a result of genetic variations in the enzyme; a meta-analysis of data obtained from children of different races who had been treated with these inhibitors has shown the children reacted differently to the treatment (12, 13). In addition, the proper timing, optimal dosing, and monitoring of ACE inhibitor therapy for the individualized treatment of patients has not been fully worked out. Also, ACE appears to have a role in several other pathological conditions including myeloid leukemia, atherosclerosis, and diabetes (in the kidneys of patients) because an increased level of either the protein or its mRNA has been reported under these conditions (14-16). In a preliminary radioautographic study, Dilsizian et al. showed that ACE expression correlated with the extent of the disease in patients with congestive heart failure and suggested that monitoring ACE expression may help monitor molecular remodeling of the heart (3). On the basis of this observation, Femia et al. envisioned that a radiotracer designed for imaging the RAS would be helpful for the development of individualized ACE inhibitor therapy (17). In this regard, a compound with high affinity for ACE, such as lisinopril or its derivative, would be best suited to study the expression of a radiotracer. Several derivatives of lisinopril that can incorporate rhodium or palladium while maintaining high affinity for ACE were reported and could probably be used to synthesize radiolabeled analogs of the compound (18). Using a single amino acid chelator technology based on the di(pyridylmethyl)amine chelator, Femia et al. synthesized a technetium-carbonyl (Tc(CO)3) core derivative of lisinopril and evaluated for the in vivo imaging of ACE expression in rats (17).","['Chopra, Arvind']",['Chopra A'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,2010/07/22 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,,,['NBK24615 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,20100722,['20080729'],['20080625'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD)'],['NLM'],"['99mTc-(CO)3D(C8)lisinopril', 'Compound', 'Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)', 'Enzyme-inhibitor binding', 'Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); gamma planar imaging', '99mTc']",['2010/07/22 06:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a technique whereby the absent or malfunctioning gene is replaced by a working gene to produce an enzyme or a protein to correct the progression of disease. Noninvasive molecular imaging technologies play an important role in the fields of gene therapy by monitoring gene expression continuously in living animals (1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging (positon emission tomography (PET)/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) modalities have been applied for gene therapy of cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, immunological, diabetic, and inherited diseases in small animals (2-10). These noninvasive imaging technologies allow quantitative assessments of the magnitude, location, and duration of the transgene expression. Gene therapy can be achieved either by ex vivo or in vivo methods. The gene can be delivered using a viral or nonviral vector, such as liposome and naked DNA. Retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and herpes simplex virus have been used as gene transfer vectors. Imaging transgene expression can help to optimize gene therapy. There are two imaging strategies, direct and indirect. Direct imaging uses a target-specific probe directly to the target. Indirect imaging involves coupling the target gene to a reporter gene, the gene expression of which can be tracked by a specific reporter gene probe. Currently, there are two approaches to image transgene expression, either by reporter enzyme using substrate probe or reporter receptor using receptor ligand probe. The enzymes include cytosine deaminase, beta-galactosidase, tyrosinase, and herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) or its mutant, HSV1-sr36tk. The most extensively studied reporter enzyme gene is HSV1-tk (8, 11). The reporter receptors are dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) (12) and somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (hSSTR2) (13). HSV1-tk is a commonly studied suicide gene for cancer therapy of glioma, prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma (10, 14). Suicide gene therapy is based on the enzymatic conversion of a nontoxic prodrug into a lethal drug by a transgene. Anti-HSV nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir, are converted to monophosphates by HSV thymidine kinase. The cellular enzymes converted the monophosphates to di- and triphosphates, which inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase. HSV1-tk has also been widely studied as a reporter gene. The HSV prodrugs have been explored for HSV1-tk reporter gene imaging. The selective phosphorylation of the prodrug probes by HSV1-tk leads to trapping within the transduced cells and not significantly in the other cells. Many radiolabeled acycloguanosine and thymidine derivatives have been studied for HSV1-tk reporter gene imaging in vitro, in small animals, and in humans (15).

This chromosomal abnormality develops after a genetic translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, which leads to the expression of an abnormal bcr-abl TK that is no longer dependent on normal activation as a result of the interaction between interleukin-3 and its receptor. This drug is also used for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) that are caused by mutations in the closely related c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) TKs (2). In addition, imatinib has been shown to be an effective treatment against a variety of other conditions that are characterized by the expression of abl, c-kit, or PDGF TKs (3). Although imatinib is a useful chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of CML and GIST, patients undergoing therapy for these conditions often develop resistance to the drug as a result of secondary mutations in the TKs. The FDA approved imatinib for the treatment of CML in May 2001 and subsequently for the treatment of GIST in January 2002 (4). A detailed description of the indications for which imatinib can be prescribed is available in the product insert from the manufacturer (5). In an attempt to initiate understanding of the development of drug resistance to imatinib, an N-[(11)C]-methyl derivative of imatinib was synthesized.

However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350-700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700-1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low infrared background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging.

This is a technique whereby the absent or malfunctioned gene is replaced by a working gene to produce an enzyme or protein to correct the progression of the disease. Noninvasive molecular imaging technologies play an important role in the fields of gene therapy by monitoring gene expression continuously in living animals (1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging (positron emission tomography (PET)/single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) modalities have been applied for gene therapy of cancer as well as cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, immunological, diabetic, and inherited diseases in small animals (2-10). These noninvasive imaging technologies allow quantitative assessments of the magnitude, location, and duration of the transgene expression. Gene therapy can be achieved either ex vivo or in vivo. The gene can be delivered using a viral or nonviral vector, such as liposome and naked DNA. Retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and herpes simplex virus have been used as gene transfer vectors. Imaging transgene expression can help to optimize gene therapy. There are two imaging strategies, direct and indirect. Direct imaging uses a target-specific probe directly to the target gene, such as receptor, enzyme, and antigen. For example, herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) vector is transduced in cells first. Labeled FIAU is introduced later to monitor its expression. Indirect imaging involves coupling the target gene to a reporter gene, the expression of which can be tracked by a specific reporter gene probe. For example, the VEGF gene is linked with HSV1-tk in a vector, which is transduced in cells. Labeled FIAU is then introduced to monitor the expression of VEGF via the expression of the reporter (HSV1-tk). Currently, there are two approaches to image transgene expression by using either a reporter enzyme using a substrate probe or a reporter receptor using a receptor ligand probe. The enzymes include cytosine deaminase, beta-galactosidase, tyrosinase, and HSV1-tk. The Na(+)/I- symporter (NIS) gene has been studied as a potential reporter gene as well as a therapeutic gene (11). The most extensively studied reporter enzyme gene is HSV1-tk (8, 12). The reporter receptors are dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) (13) and somatostatin receptor subtype-2 (hSSTR2) (14). HSV1-tk is a commonly studied suicide gene for cancer therapy of glioma, prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma (10, 15). Suicide gene therapy is based on the enzymatic conversion of a nontoxic prodrug into a lethal drug by a transgene. Anti-HSV nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir, are converted to monophosphates by HSV-TK. The cellular enzymes then convert the monophosphates to di- and triphosphates, which inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase. HSV1-tk has also been widely studied as a reporter gene. The HSV prodrugs have been explored for HSV1-tk reporter gene imaging. The selective phosphorylation of the produg probes by HSV1-TK leads to trapping within the transduced cells and not significantly in the other cells. Many radiolabeled acycloguanosine and thymidine derivatives have been studied for HSV1-tk reporter gene imaging in vitro, in small animals, and in humans (16). 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxy-5'-iodo-1beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FIAU) has been tested as an anti-viral thymidine nucleoside analog against herpes and hepatitis viruses. Radiolabeled FIAU has been evaluated in vitro and in small animals to be a potential imaging agent for HSV1-tk gene expression using PET/SPECT imaging (17, 18).","['Leung, Kam']",['Leung K'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,2010/07/22 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,,,['NBK23210 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,20100722,['20050209'],['20050201'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Molecular Imaging and Contrast Agent Database (MICAD)'],['NLM'],"['[123/124/125/131I]FIAU', 'Compound', 'Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)', 'Phosphorylation', 'Positron emission tomography (PET)/ Single-photon emission computed tomography', '(SPECT)', '123/124/125/131I']",['2010/07/22 06:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their role in the development of different neoplasms, small-molecule drugs such as imatinib, dasatinib, and others that block TK activity by inhibiting ATP binding to the enzyme are often used to treat patients suffering from this disease (3, 4). Because several different TK blockers are either under development or are being evaluated in clinical trials to treat cancers, it is important to be able to screen patients to determine which TK inhibitor is likely to result in a good prognosis for an individual (5). Although invasive procedures such as biopsies are routinely used to determine the efficacy of an anti-cancer treatment, a noninvasive technique such as imaging would probably be preferred to evaluate drug activity during early stages of the treatment. Wu et al. envisioned that antibodies labeled with a radionuclide and directed toward an intracellular non-receptor TK could be used for the noninvasive determination of drug efficacy (5).

We found that Zap70 knocked-down mESCs (Zap70KD) show sustained self-renewal and defective differentiation. In addition, we present evidence that the sustained self-renewal in Zap70KD is associated with enhanced Jak/Stat3 signaling and c-Myc induction. These altered signaling appears to result from upregulated leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and downregulated src homology region 2 domain containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) phosphatase activity.

By directly targeting the Bcr-Abl kinase, imatinib leads to durable cytogenetic remissions and in turn improved survival. However, many patients with CML develop resistance, fail to respond, or become intolerant to imatinib due to side effects. This has spurred interest in developing second-generation TKIs to overcome the mechanisms of resistance that lead to treatment failure, specifically Bcr-Abl1 kinase domain mutations. Two second-generation TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, are approved for the treatment of CML after imatinib failure or intolerance. Unfortunately, many patients fail subsequent treatment with these agents, as they can develop highly resistant mutations such as T315I. Various other strategies are now in use to optimize the treatment of CML, including dose optimization of imatinib, combination therapy, upfront use of second-generation TKIs, and use of maintenance therapy with interferon-alpha and vaccines.

Different subgroups of ALV commonly infect egg-laying hens. They are responsible for economic losses due to both mortality and depressed performance in chickens. To investigate the presence of these viruses in chickens in Iran, 560 egg albumens were selected from different farms of Fars province, Iran. These eggs were obtained from flocks of two research centers of native fowl production (60 eggs), a broiler grandparent farm (100 eggs), three broiler breeder farms (300 eggs), and a commercial layer flock (100 eggs). Firstly, for primary screening a degenerative primer set (PU1 and PU2) were used in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positive cases were detected in 47 of 300 (15.7%) samples from three broiler breeders, 40 of 100 (40%) samples from commercial layer, 53 of 60 (88.3%) samples from flocks of two research centers of native fowl production, and none from the samples of broiler grandparent. Then RT-PCR was undertaken with primers PA1 and PA2 on the positive samples.

The central focus of cancer genetics is the study of mutations that are causally implicated in tumorigenesis. The identification of such causal mutations not only provides insight into cancer biology but also presents anticancer therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Understanding the human genetic variation through Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) is currently believed to reveal the cause of individual susceptibility to disease and the large variation observed in response to treatment. The aim of our study reported here is to determine the deleterious SNPs that can alter the expression and function of the ARNT gene in causing acute myeloblastic leukemia through computational methods. Our approach will present the application of computational tools in understanding functional variation from the perspective of structure, expression, evolution and phenotype. Based on the SIFT (evolutionary basedapproach) and PolyPhen (structure based-approach) scores, structure analysis was carried out with the major mutation that occurred in the native protein (1X0O) coded by ARNT gene, which are at the amino acid position F363L and R430Q. The amino acid residues in the native and mutant modeled protein were further analyzed for solvent accessibility, and secondary structure to check the stability of the proteins. The models built in this work would be applicable for predicting the deleterious nsSNPs which would be helpful for further genotype-phenotype research as well as pharmacogenetics studies.","['George Priya Doss, C', 'Sethumadhavan, Rao']","['George Priya Doss C', 'Sethumadhavan R']","['School of Biotechnology, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology University, Vellore, 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090807,Germany,Interdiscip Sci,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",101515919,"['0 (ARNT protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '138391-32-9 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/genetics', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Software']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2009/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12539-009-0042-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Interdiscip Sci. 2009 Sep;1(3):220-8. doi: 10.1007/s12539-009-0042-9.

Recently, Tan-I has been reported to have anti-tumor effects. In this study, we investigated the growth inhibition and apoptosis inducing effects of Tan-I on three kinds of monocytic leukemia cells (U937, THP-1 and SHI 1). Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) and AnnexinV/PI staining. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and telomerase activity before and after apoptosis. The activity of caspase-3 was determined by Caspase colorimetric assay kit and Western blot analysis. Expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Survivin was assayed by Western blot and Real-time RT-PCR using the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System. The results revealed that Tan-I could inhibit the growth of these three kinds of leukemia cells and cause apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After treatment by Tan-I for 48 h, Western blotting showed cleavage of the caspase-3 zymogen protein with the appearance of its 17-kD subunit, and a 89-kD cleavage product of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a known substrate of caspase-3, was also found clearly. The expression of hTERT mRNA as well as activity of telomerase were decreased concurrently in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot revealed a significant down-regulation of Survivin. We therefore conclude that the induction of apoptosis by Tan-I in monocytic leukemia U937 THP-1 and SHI 1 cells is highly correlated with activation of caspase-3 and decreasing of hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity as well as down-regulation of Survivin expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the effects of Tan-I on monocytic leukemia cells.","['Liu, Xiao-Dan', 'Fan, Rui-Fang', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Yang, Hong-Zhi', 'Fang, Zhi-Gang', 'Guan, Wei-Bing', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Xiao, Ruo-Zhi', 'Huang, Ren-Wei', 'Huang, He-Qing', 'Liu, Pei-Qing', 'Liu, Jia-Jun']","['Liu XD', 'Fan RF', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang HZ', 'Fang ZG', 'Guan WB', 'Lin DJ', 'Xiao RZ', 'Huang RW', 'Huang HQ', 'Liu PQ', 'Liu JJ']","['Hematological Department & Institute, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, China; E-Mails: lenovo381@126.com (X.-D.L.); xfangcn@163.com (R.-F.F.); fzg92@163.com (Z.-G.F.); dongjunlin0168@163.com (D.-J.L.); ruozhi_xiao@yahoo.com (R.-Z.X.); huangrw56@163.com (R.-W.H.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100526,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/07/20 06:01,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3390/ijms11062267 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2010 May 26;11(6):2267-80. doi: 10.3390/ijms11062267.,,,,PMC2904915,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Tanshinone I (Tan-I)', 'leukemia', 'survivin', 'telomerase']",,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20110714'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes from about half of HTLV-1 infected subjects spontaneously proliferate in vitro, and how this phenomenon relates to symptomatic disease outcome and viral burden is poorly understood. Spontaneous proliferation was measured in lymphocyte subsets, and these findings were correlated with HTLV-1 proviral load and Tax expression in PBMCs. We found that in addition to previously described vigorous CD8+ T cell spontaneous proliferation, natural killer (NK) cells spontaneously proliferated to a similar high level, resulting in expansion of CD56-expressing NK cells. Spontaneous NK cell proliferation positively correlated with HTLV-1 proviral load but not with Tax expression or the presence of HAM/TSP. The strongest correlate with clinical outcome in this cohort was the ability of cells to express Tax, while HTLV-1 proviral load was more closely related to spontaneous NK cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that spontaneous proliferation, Tax expression, and proviral load are inter-related but not equivalent, and that spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation is not restricted to T cells, the targets of HTLV-1 infection.","['Norris, Philip J', 'Hirschkorn, Dale F', 'DeVita, Deborah A', 'Lee, Tzong-Hae', 'Murphy, Edward L']","['Norris PJ', 'Hirschkorn DF', 'DeVita DA', 'Lee TH', 'Murphy EL']","['Blood Systems Research Institute, and Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. pnorris@bloodsystems.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Virulence,Virulence,101531386,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/20 06:00,2011/03/16 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/viru.1.1.9868 [doi]'],ppublish,Virulence. 2010 Jan-Feb;1(1):19-28. doi: 10.4161/viru.1.1.9868.,,,"['R01 HL062235/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL062235-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-062235/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2903746,,['Virulence. 2010 Jan-Feb;1(1):8-9.

SUMOylation of E1B-55K is required to transform primary mammalian cells in cooperation with adenovirus E1A and to repress p53 tumour suppressor functions. The biochemical consequences of SUMO1 conjugation of 55K have so far remained elusive. Here, we report that E1B-55K physically interacts with different isoforms of the tumour suppressor protein promyelocytic leukaemia (PML). We show that E1B-55K binds to PML isoforms IV and V in a SUMO1-dependent and -independent manner. Interaction with PML-IV promotes the localization of 55K to PML-containing subnuclear structures (PML-NBs). In virus-infected cells, this process is negatively regulated by other viral proteins, indicating that binding to PML is controlled through reversible SUMOylation in a timely coordinated manner. These results together with earlier work are consistent with the idea that SUMOylation regulates targeting of E1B-55K to PML-NBs, known to control transcriptional regulation, tumour suppression, DNA repair and apoptosis. Furthermore, they suggest that SUMO1-dependent modulation of p53-dependent growth suppression through E1B-55K PML-IV interaction has a key role in adenovirus-mediated cell transformation.","['Wimmer, P', 'Schreiner, S', 'Everett, R D', 'Sirma, H', 'Groitl, P', 'Dobner, T']","['Wimmer P', 'Schreiner S', 'Everett RD', 'Sirma H', 'Groitl P', 'Dobner T']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Heinrich-Pette-Institute for Experimental Virology and Immunology, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100719,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Rats', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010284 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.284 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Oct 7;29(40):5511-22. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.284.

As a possible explanation for the decreased levels of Numb in the blast crisis phase, we show that NUP98-HOXA9, an oncogene associated with blast crisis CML, can trigger expression of the RNA-binding protein Musashi2 (Msi2), which in turn represses Numb. Notably, loss of Msi2 restores Numb expression and significantly impairs the development and propagation of blast crisis CML in vitro and in vivo. Finally we show that Msi2 expression is not only highly upregulated during human CML progression but is also an early indicator of poorer prognosis. These data show that the Musashi-Numb pathway can control the differentiation of CML cells, and raise the possibility that targeting this pathway may provide a new strategy for the therapy of aggressive leukaemias.","['Ito, Takahiro', 'Kwon, Hyog Young', 'Zimdahl, Bryan', 'Congdon, Kendra L', 'Blum, Jordan', 'Lento, William E', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Lagoo, Anand', 'Gerrard, Gareth', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Goldman, John', 'Goh, Harriet', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Reya, Tannishtha']","['Ito T', 'Kwon HY', 'Zimdahl B', 'Congdon KL', 'Blum J', 'Lento WE', 'Zhao C', 'Lagoo A', 'Gerrard G', 'Foroni L', 'Goldman J', 'Goh H', 'Kim SH', 'Kim DW', 'Chuah C', 'Oehler VG', 'Radich JP', 'Jordan CT', 'Reya T']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100718,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MSI2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Msi2h protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Numb protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/09/25 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2008/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['nature09171 [pii]', '10.1038/nature09171 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Aug 5;466(7307):765-8. doi: 10.1038/nature09171.

METHODS: 5-LO enzyme activity was assayed using insect cell lysates overexpressing rat 5-LO. The leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) level was assayed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cell line. Mouse ear edema was induced by topical application of arachidonic acid. Atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion was induced by topical application of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) to NC/Nga mice. RESULTS: KR-33749 inhibited 5-LO activity with an IC(50) value of 70.5 +/- 6.0 nmol/l in parallel with LTB(4) inhibition in RBL-1 cells. The compound exhibited a >1,000-fold selectivity against 12-LO and 15-LO. KR-33749 showed in vivo protective effects against arachidonic acid-induced ear edema and DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis-like symptoms in NC/Nga mice. CONCLUSION: Our results show that KR-33749, a new 5-LO inhibitor exhibits potent antiinflammatory activities in vitro as well as in vivo.","['Cho, Young Sik', 'Kim, Chi Hyun', 'Surh, Ji Hee', 'Kang, Nam Sook', 'Yoo, Sung-Eun', 'Cheon, Hyae Gyeong']","['Cho YS', 'Kim CH', 'Surh JH', 'Kang NS', 'Yoo SE', 'Cheon HG']","['Center for Metabolic Syndrome Therapeutics, Bioorganic Science Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100717,Switzerland,Pharmacology,Pharmacology,0152016,"['0 (4-(4-(4-fluorophenyl)thiazol-2-ylamino)-2,6-dimethylphenol)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Dinitrochlorobenzene)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Xylenes)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Dinitrochlorobenzene/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Edema/prevention & control', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Skin/drug effects/pathology', 'Skin Diseases/drug therapy', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Xylenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['000315488 [pii]', '10.1159/000315488 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacology. 2010;86(2):65-72. doi: 10.1159/000315488.

We demonstrate that the differentiation of these cells is critically dependent on TGF-beta in both mice and humans. Moreover, in vivo generation of Foxp3(+) iNKT cells was observed in the TGF-beta-rich environment of the murine gut. Foxp3(+) iNKT cells displayed a phenotype similar to that of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and they suppress through a contact-dependent, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-mediated mechanism. Nevertheless, Foxp3(+) iNKT cells retain distinctive NKT cell characteristics, such as promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein expression and preferential homing to the liver following adoptive transfer, where they stably maintained Foxp3 expression. Our data thus unveil an unexpected capacity of iNKT cells to acquire regulatory functions that may contribute to the establishment of immunological tolerance.","['Monteiro, Marta', 'Almeida, Catarina F', 'Caridade, Marta', 'Ribot, Julie C', 'Duarte, Joana', 'Agua-Doce, Ana', 'Wollenberg, Ivonne', 'Silva-Santos, Bruno', 'Graca, Luis']","['Monteiro M', 'Almeida CF', 'Caridade M', 'Ribot JC', 'Duarte J', 'Agua-Doce A', 'Wollenberg I', 'Silva-Santos B', 'Graca L']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100716,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (alpha-galactosylceramide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Galactosylceramides/immunology/pharmacology', 'Liver/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000359 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000359 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Aug 15;185(4):2157-63. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000359.

FANCJ, one of 13 genes linked to FA, encodes a DNA helicase proposed to operate in homologous recombination repair and replicational stress response. The pathogenic FANCJ-A349P amino acid substitution resides immediately adjacent to a highly conserved cysteine of the iron-sulfur domain. Given the genetic linkage of the FANCJ-A349P allele to FA, we investigated the effect of this particular mutation on the biochemical and cellular functions of the FANCJ protein. Purified recombinant FANCJ-A349P protein had reduced iron and was defective in coupling adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and translocase activity to unwinding forked duplex or G-quadruplex DNA substrates or disrupting protein-DNA complexes. The FANCJ-A349P allele failed to rescue cisplatin or telomestatin sensitivity of a FA-J null cell line as detected by cell survival or gamma-H2AX foci formation. Furthermore, expression of FANCJ-A349P in a wild-type background exerted a dominant-negative effect, indicating that the mutant protein interferes with normal DNA metabolism. The ability of FANCJ to use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to produce the force required to unwind DNA or destabilize protein bound to DNA is required for its role in DNA repair.","['Wu, Yuliang', 'Sommers, Joshua A', 'Suhasini, Avvaru N', 'Leonard, Thomas', 'Deakyne, Julianna S', 'Mazin, Alexander V', 'Shin-Ya, Kazuo', 'Kitao, Hiroyuki', 'Brosh, Robert M Jr']","['Wu Y', 'Sommers JA', 'Suhasini AN', 'Leonard T', 'Deakyne JS', 'Mazin AV', 'Shin-Ya K', 'Kitao H', 'Brosh RM Jr']","['Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Center, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100716,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BACH1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (telomestatin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repair/*genetics/*physiology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Oxazoles/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31101-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-256016 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 11;116(19):3780-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-256016.

RESULTS: Compliance with Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL) guidelines was found to be relatively low (28% for ECIL and 55% for IDSA), although no significant differences were found between the two groups (adherence versus non-adherence). In both subgroup analyses (IDSA and ECIL), compliance with the guidelines did not impact the 120 day survival rate. Instead, adherence to guidelines led to a higher response rate to first-line antifungal treatment (76% in the IDSA group and 84% in the ECIL group). CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines establish categories of patients with homogeneous characteristics, and suggest optimal diagnostic and therapeutic options for them. Acquisition of good results through adherence to guidelines is confirmed by our series.

Acute viral infections may then be attributed either to transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI) or reactivation of a past infection. METHODS: A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had >250 blood donor exposures developed acute Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Routine donor testing for HB core antibodies (anti-HBc) was in place in the relevant period and investigations undertaken on the blood donors were negative. RESULTS: Review of historical, molecular, and antigenic evidence demonstrated reactivation of a recovered HBV infection dating >30 years and the selection of a rare escape mutant that briefly replicated and caused acute liver disease. This mutant was unreactive with several HBsAg assays and poorly reactive with an HBV vaccine plasma. Correcting the C139Y substitution by site directed mutagenesis of recombinant surface proteins re-established assay reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine, but not Chlorambucil, appeared sufficiently immunosuppressive to trigger reactivation despite low levels of neutralizing antibodies.

However, high levels of maternal soy consumption have been linked to the development of infant leukemia ALL and AML. The majority of infant leukemia is linked to mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) translocations. Previous studies have implicated topoisomerase II (Top2) in genistein-induced infant leukemia. In order to understand the roles of the two Top2 isozymes in and the molecular mechanism for genistein-induced infant leukemia, we carried out studies in vitro using purified recombinant human Top2 isozymes, as well as studies in cultured mouse myeloid progenitor cells (32Dc13) and Top2beta knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). First, we showed that genistein efficiently induced both Top2alpha and Top2beta cleavage complexes in the purified system as well as in cultured mouse cells. Second, genistein induced proteasomal degradation of Top2beta in 32Dc13 cells. Third, the genistein-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) signal, gamma-H2AX, was dependent on the Top2beta isozyme and proteasome activity. Fourth, the requirement for Top2beta and proteasome activity was mirrored in genistein-induced DNA sequence rearrangements, as monitored by a DNA integration assay. Together, our results suggest a model in which genistein-induced Top2beta cleavage complexes are processed by proteasome, leading to the exposure of otherwise Top2beta-concealed DSBs and subsequent chromosome rearrangements, and implicate a major role of Top2beta and proteasome in genistein-induced infant leukemia.","['Azarova, Anna M', 'Lin, Ren-Kuo', 'Tsai, Yuan-Chin', 'Liu, Leroy F', 'Lin, Chao-Po', 'Lyu, Yi Lisa']","['Azarova AM', 'Lin RK', 'Tsai YC', 'Liu LF', 'Lin CP', 'Lyu YL']","['Department of Pharmacology, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA. lyuyi@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100716,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Genistein/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic/*drug effects']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/09/03 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)01345-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.07.043 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Aug 13;399(1):66-71. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.07.043.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 1999, the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) invited the Australasian Leukemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) to collaborate on a prospective study of limited chemotherapy and radiotherapy for osteolymphoma. The treatment was designed to maintain efficacy but limit the risk of subsequent pathological fractures. Patient assessment included both functional imaging and isotope bone scanning. Treatment included three cycles of CHOP chemotherapy and radiation to a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions using a shrinking field technique. RESULTS: The trial closed because of slow accrual after 33 patients had been entered. Accrual was noted to slow down after Rituximab became readily available in Australia. After a median follow-up of 4.3 years, the five-year overall survival and local control rates are estimated at 90% and 72% respectively. Three patients had fractures at presentation that persisted after treatment, one with recurrent lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively high rates of survival were achieved but the number of local failures suggests that the dose of radiotherapy should remain higher than it is for other types of lymphoma. Disability after treatment due to pathological fracture was not seen.","['Christie, David', 'Dear, Keith', 'Le, Thai', 'Barton, Michael', 'Wirth, Andrew', 'Porter, David', 'Roos, Daniel', 'Pratt, Gary']","['Christie D', 'Dear K', 'Le T', 'Barton M', 'Wirth A', 'Porter D', 'Roos D', 'Pratt G']","['Premion and Bond University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. christie@premion.com.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100716,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/supply & distribution/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Australasia', 'Australia', '*Benchmarking', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods/standards', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Early Termination of Clinical Trials/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy/methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Regression Analysis', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/20 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(10)00521-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.03.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Jul 15;80(4):1164-70. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.03.036.

TRAIL has been widely studied for its anti-tumor function and signaling mechanisms. Using chemotaxis and mouse air-pouch model analyses, we determined that TRAIL-induced chemotactic migration of THP-1 human leukemia and LPS-primed primary human monocytes as well as LPS-stimulated BALB/c mouse monocytes in vivo. To expand the understanding of the TRAIL signaling pathway in this process, we found that the TRAIL receptor DR4 was highly expressed in THP-1 and LPS-primed primary monocytes but not in the non-primed primary monocytes. DR4 neutralization antibody specifically suppressed TRAIL-induced migration of the monocytes. Furthermore, PI3K, Rho GTPase and its downstream effectors, MLC and Pak1, were activated during cell migration. PI3K inhibitors and dominant negative mutants of RhoGTPase blocked monocyte migration toward TRAIL, indicating that PI3K and RhoGTPases were involved in the migration signaling. The DR4 neutralization antibody blocked the activation of PI3K and Rho GTPase effectors in the cells. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that TRAIL induces monocyte migration mediated by TRAIL receptor DR4 via the RhoGTPase signaling pathway. This study is expected to provide novel evidence of the non-apoptotic function of TRAIL in immune defense.","['Wei, Wei', 'Wang, Dongsheng', 'Shi, Juan', 'Xiang, Yang', 'Zhang, Yaxi', 'Liu, Shilian', 'Liu, Yanxin', 'Zheng, Dexian']","['Wei W', 'Wang D', 'Shi J', 'Xiang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu S', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng D']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 5 Dong Dan San Tiao, Beijing 100005, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100716,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Kidney', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Skin Window Technique', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/physiology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/physiology']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(10)00473-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2010.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2010 Sep;47(15):2475-84. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2010.06.004.

Outcome of patients with clinical relapse after transplantation generally remains poor, but intervention prior to florid relapse improves outcome for certain hematologic malignancies. To detect early relapse or minimal residual disease, sensitive methods such as molecular genetics, tumor-specific molecular primers, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) are commonly used after allogeneic stem cell transplantation to monitor patients, but not all of them are included in the commonly employed disease-specific response criteria. The highest sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by molecular monitoring of tumor- or patient-specific markers measured by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, but not all diseases have such targets for monitoring. Similar high sensitivity can be achieved by determination of recipient-donor chimerism, but its specificity regarding detection of relapse is low and differs substantially among diseases. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about the utilization of such sensitive monitoring techniques in chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and lymphoid malignancies based on tumor-specific markers and cell chimerism and how these methods might augment the standard definitions of posttransplant remission, persistence, progression, relapse, and the prediction of relapse. Critically important is the need for standardization of the different residual disease techniques and to assess the clinical relevance of minimal residual disease and chimerism surveillance in individual diseases, which in turn must be followed by studies to assess the potential impact of specific interventional strategies.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Bader, Peter', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Khouri, Issa', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Willasch, Andre', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Bishop, Michael R', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Kroger N', 'Bacher U', 'Bader P', 'Bottcher S', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Dreger P', 'Khouri I', 'Olavarria E', 'Radich J', 'Stock W', 'Vose JM', 'Weisdorf D', 'Willasch A', 'Giralt S', 'Bishop MR', 'Wayne AS']","['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.du']",['eng'],['Congress'],20100715,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnostic Imaging/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/prevention & control/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/prevention & control/*surgery', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/prevention & control/*surgery', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2010/07/20 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00291-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Oct;16(10):1325-46. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.07.001.

In the last decade, an emerging concept has proposed that the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and their interactions with the BM microenvironment are the major cause of the acute leukemia relapse. Adhesion to the stromal niche is crucial for LSCs as it directly supports self-renewal, proliferation, arrest of differentiation and protects from damaging chemo-agents. One of the key players in this crosstalk between leukemic cells and the BM stroma niche is the chemokine SDF-1. SDF-1 regulates the process of homing and engraftment of LSCs into the BM and inhibition of its receptor CXCR4 induces leukemic cell mobilization into the circulation. However, besides its chemotactic and adhesive functions, SDF-1 is also a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates leukemic cell proliferation as well as their program of differentiation. CXCR4 antagonists are used in combination with chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies, which demonstrate that blocking CXCR4 is a novel promising approach of therapy. In this review, we focus on the multifaceted SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in acute leukemia and discuss how targeting this pathway could provide potential interest to eradicate the LSCs.","['Tavor, Sigal', 'Petit, Isabelle']","['Tavor S', 'Petit I']","['Institute of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. tavorsigal@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100715,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/physiology']",2010/07/20 06:00,2011/01/13 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(10)00048-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2010 Jun;20(3):178-85. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.07.001.

A positive selection of leukemia (antigen)-specific T cells would be highly desirable. In this study, we focused on the immunogenic leukemia antigen Wilms' Tumor gene 1 (WT1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed the technology of streptamers available at good manufacturing practice level to first determine the frequency of human leukocyte antigen-A2 restricted WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells. Then, specific cells were labeled with streptamers and selected by magnetic cell separation. Purity and immunophenotype of selected cells were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 40 healthy donors had naive WT1-specific CD8(+) T-cell frequencies of >0.5%, and 8 of 40 even >1.0% of all CD8(+) T cells. In 7 of 10 acute myeloid leukemia patients, the frequencies were 0.5% to 3.65%. After positive selection by magnetic cell separation, a 60-fold increase with a purity of up to 17.79% in the lymphocyte gate and 86.18% in the CD8(+) T-cell gate could be achieved for CD8(+)WT1 streptamer(+)CD28(+/-)CD45RA(+)CCR7(-) effector T cells.

Furthermore, we review the literature on Auer rod-like structures in B-cell neoplasms.","['Hristov, Alexandra C', 'Saladino, Andrew', 'Nava, Victor E', 'Gocke, Christopher D']","['Hristov AC', 'Saladino A', 'Nava VE', 'Gocke CD']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100402,United States,Ann Diagn Pathol,Annals of diagnostic pathology,9800503,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Inclusion Bodies/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/11/10 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2009/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1092-9134(09)00116-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2009.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Diagn Pathol. 2010 Aug;14(4):292-5. doi: 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2009.07.005.

METHODS: Following L-Asp treatment with designed concentrations and duration, the IC50 (inhibitory concentration 50%) of 8 kinds of common leukemia cell lines (U937, HL-60, Jurkat, NB4, THP-1, Namalwa, Karpass299, K562) were determined by CCK-8 assay. The changes of the 4 kinds of amino acids mentioned above were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The asparagines in cell culture medium were rapidly exhausted when treated with 0.01 U/mL L-Asp for 4 hrs or 1 U/mL L-Asp for 5 minutes. There were significant differences in the sensitivities to L-Asp of different leukemia cell lines. The sensitivities to L-Asp of various cell lines were dose-dependent. Low concentration of L-Asp resulted in a low IC50 and the IC50 increased following the L-Asp concentration increased. CONCLUSIONS: Different leukemia cell lines have different sensitivities to L-Asp, suggesting that exhaustion of asparagines around leukemia cells could not reflect the treatment efficacy of L-Asp. L-Asp antileukemic activity is dose-dependent, which suggests the importance of high-dose L-Asp on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Li, Ben-Shang', 'Luo, Chang-Ying', 'He, Ying-Yi', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Gu, Long-Jun']","['Li BS', 'Luo CY', 'He YY', 'Jiang H', 'Gu LJ']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/*analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2010)07-0557-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2010 Jul;12(7):557-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed at examining the overall and specific cancer risks among hospitalized T1DM patients from the national registers in Sweden. METHODS: A T1DM research cohort was created by identifying T1DM patients from the Hospital Discharge Register and linking them with the Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for subsequent cancers were calculated among patients with T1DM compared with those without T1DM. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight cases were ascertained with subsequent cancers during the follow-up duration from 1964 to 2006, with an increased overall SIR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.04-1.33) among 24 052 T1DM patients identified at baseline. Significant excess was noted for gastric and skin (squamous cell carcinoma) cancers and for leukaemia. Increased risk of acute lymphatic leukaemia accounted for most of the variation of leukaemia risk (SIR = 5.31, 95% CI 3.32-8.05). Cancer risk varied with sex, age at first hospitalization and numbers of hospitalizations. The risk was higher in women compared with men and in those hospitalized for T1DM at age over 10 years compared with the younger patients. Higher risks were also found among those with more hospital visits. CONCLUSION: By quantifying the variations of overall and site-specific cancer risks after T1DM, the current study provides novel associations between T1DM and subsequent cancers, the mechanisms of which remain to be established.","['Shu, X', 'Ji, J', 'Li, X', 'Sundquist, J', 'Sundquist, K', 'Hemminki, K']","['Shu X', 'Ji J', 'Li X', 'Sundquist J', 'Sundquist K', 'Hemminki K']","['Center for Family and Community Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Alfred Nobels alle 12, Huddinge, Sweden. xiaochen.shu@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Diabet Med,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,8500858,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2010/07/20 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['DME3011 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03011.x [doi]']",ppublish,Diabet Med. 2010 Jul;27(7):791-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03011.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated if ACHT could induce MSI in tumor-derived plasma-circulating DNA (pfDNA) and in normal peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells. We also evaluated if amifostine could interfere with this process in an in-vitro model. METHODS: MSI was determined in pfDNA, PBMN cells and urine cell-free DNA (ufDNA) of 33 breast cancer patients before and after ACHT. MCF-7 cells and PBMN from normal donors were exposed in vitro to melphalan, with or without amifostine. RESULTS: We observed at least one MSI event in PBMN cells, pfDNA or ufDNA of 87, 80 and 80% of patients, respectively. In vitro, melphalan induced MSI in both MCF-7 and normal PBMN cells. In PBMN cells, ACHT-induced MSI occurred together with a significant decrease in the expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene hMSH2. Amifostine decreased hMSH2 expression and also prevented MSI induction only in normal PBMN cells. CONCLUSIONS: ACHT induced MSI in PBMN cells and in tumour-derived pfDNA. Because of its protective effect against ACHT induction of MSI in normal PBMN cells in vitro, amifostine may be a potential agent for preventing secondary leukaemias in patients exposed to ACHT.","['Pinto, Jorge L F', 'Fonseca, Fernando L A', 'Marsicano, Sarah R', 'Delgado, Pamela O', ""Sant'anna, Aleksandra V L"", 'Coelho, Patricia G', 'Maeda, Patrica', 'Del Giglio, Auro']","['Pinto JL', 'Fonseca FL', 'Marsicano SR', 'Delgado PO', ""Sant'anna AV"", 'Coelho PG', 'Maeda P', 'Del Giglio A']","['ABC Foundations School of Medicine, Santo Andre, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Amifostine/*pharmacology', 'Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Microsatellite Instability/*drug effects', 'Microsatellite Repeats/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Reference Values']",2010/07/20 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JPHP1108 [pii]', '10.1211/jpp.62.07.0015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2010 Jul;62(7):931-4. doi: 10.1211/jpp.62.07.0015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this retrospective multicentre study is to report on cases of gut aspergillosis in haematology patients, including clinical presentation, risk factors, and outcome. Twenty-one patients from nine centres were identified. Eight had isolated gut aspergillosis, with no evidence of other infected sites, and 13 had disseminated aspergillosis. Thirteen patients had acute leukaemia. Nine were allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. Clinical symptoms and imaging were poorly specific. The galactomannan antigenaemia test result was positive in 16/25 (64%) patients, including in four of the eight cases of isolated gut aspergillosis. Five of 21 patients had a dietary regimen rich in spices, suggesting that, in these cases, food could have been the source of gut colonization, and then of a primary gut Aspergillus lesion. The diagnosis was made post-mortem in six patients. The mortality rate in the remaining patients at 12 weeks was 7/15 (47%). Gut aspergillosis is probably misdiagnosed and underestimated in haematology patients, owing to the poor specificity of symptoms and imaging.

Controlling graft-versus-host disease while preserving the benefits of graft-versus-leukemia still constitutes a challenge. A promising approach for the control of graft-versus-host disease is suicide gene therapy, which involves the ex vivo genetic modification of donor T cells with a suicide gene that allows for the selective elimination of the cells in vivo if graft-versus-host disease occurs. This article presents an overview of such approaches with special reference to lessons learned from previous clinical experiences, as well as a discussion of critical factors in suicide gene therapy.","['Georgoudaki, Anna-Maria', 'Sutlu, Tolga', 'Alici, Evren']","['Georgoudaki AM', 'Sutlu T', 'Alici E']","['Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,,IM,"['*Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.10.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2010 Jul;2(4):521-37. doi: 10.2217/imt.10.19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the past decade, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the immunology of CML, which has raised hopes that this disease may be curable by supplementing the current targeted chemotherapy with immunotherapeutic approaches. More than ten small-scale clinical trials have been carried out with experimental vaccines predominantly based on the p210bcr-abl fusion protein. Their results suggested beneficial effects in some patients. Recent data obtained in human patients as well as in animal models indicate that the p210bcr-abl protein does not carry the immunodominant epitope(s). These observations, combined with the recognition of an ever increasing number of other immunogenic proteins in CML cells, strongly support the concept that gene-modified, cell-based vaccines containing the full spectrum of tumor antigens might be the most effective immunotherapeutic approach. Recently created mathematical models have provided important leads for the timing of the combination of targeted drug therapy with vaccine administration. A strategy of how targeted drug therapy might be combined with vaccination is outlined.","['Vonka, Vladimir']",['Vonka V'],"['Department of Experimental Virology, Institutute of Hematology & Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. vonka@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Forecasting', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Immunotherapy, Active', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological', 'Vaccination']",2010/07/20 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.10.2 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2010 Mar;2(2):227-41. doi: 10.2217/imt.10.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In tumor cells that can express HLA class II molecules, such as myeloid leukemic blasts, abnormalities in the processing pathways of endogenous antigens could also result in impaired HLA class II-restricted tumor-associated antigen presentation to CD4(+) T helper cells.

For instance, monocyte-derived DCs have been loaded with apoptotic whole-cell suspensions, necrotic cell lysates, tumor-associated peptides, eluted peptides and cellular DNA or RNA. Furthermore, monocyte-derived DCs can be chemically or electrically fused with leukemic blasts, and DCs have been cultured out of leukemic blasts.

In this study, we show that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) binds to the promoter of smooth muscle alpha-actin, reducing mRNA and protein levels encoded by this gene and resulting in a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), this effect on alpha-actin expression is correlated with a change in cellular phenotype from spindle shaped to polygonal and flattened. This morphological change is dependent on Ras function. The polygonal, flattened CEF show a high degree of resistance to the transforming activity of several oncoproteins. Our results support the conclusion that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in tumor suppression by PLZF.","['Shi, Jin', 'Sun, Minghao', 'Vogt, Peter K']","['Shi J', 'Sun M', 'Vogt PK']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Shape/*physiology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['104 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.104 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2010 May;1(1):9-21. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.104.,,,"['R01 CA078230-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107094-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107094-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107094-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107094-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107094-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078230-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078045-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2903758,,,,['NIHMS198370'],,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PLZF', 'actin cytoskeleton', 'oncogenic transformation', 'smooth muscle alpha-actin', 'transcriptional repression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary prophylaxis could reduce disease burden and improve survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, open-label, multicenter trial was conducted evaluating voriconazole (4 mg/kg/12 h intravenously or 200 mg/12 h orally) as secondary antifungal prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients with previous proven or probable invasive fungal infection. Voriconazole was started 48 h or more after completion of conditioning chemotherapy and was planned to be continued for 100-150 days. Patients were followed for 12 months. The primary end-point of the study was the incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal infection. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled, 41 of whom had acute leukemia. Previous invasive fungal infections were proven or probable aspergillosis (n=31), proven candidiasis (n=5) and other proven or probable infections (n=6); prior infection could not be confirmed in three patients. The median duration of voriconazole prophylaxis was 94 days. Eleven patients (24%) died within 12 months of transplantation, but only one due to systemic fungal disease. Three invasive fungal infections occurred post-transplant: two relapses (one candidemia and one fatal scedosporiosis) and one new zygomycosis in a patient with previous aspergillosis. The 1-year cumulative incidence of invasive fungal disease was 6.7+/-3.6%. Two patients were withdrawn from the study due to treatment-related adverse events (i.e. liver toxicity). CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole appears to be safe and effective for secondary prophylaxis of systemic fungal infection after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The observed incidence of 6.7% (with one attributable death) is considerably lower than the relapse rate reported in historical controls, thus suggesting that voriconazole is a promising prophylactic agent in this population.","['Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Faucher, Catherine', 'Bilger, Karin', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Cornely, Oliver A', 'Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Bofarull, Rodrigo Martino', 'de la Camara, Rafael', 'Weisser, Maja', 'Liakopoulou, Effie', 'Abecasis, Manuel', 'Heussel, Claus Peter', 'Pineau, Marc', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Einsele, Hermann']","['Cordonnier C', 'Rovira M', 'Maertens J', 'Olavarria E', 'Faucher C', 'Bilger K', 'Pigneux A', 'Cornely OA', 'Ullmann AJ', 'Bofarull RM', 'de la Camara R', 'Weisser M', 'Liakopoulou E', 'Abecasis M', 'Heussel CP', 'Pineau M', 'Ljungman P', 'Einsele H']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Henri Mondor, 51 Av.

We, therefore, retrospectively analyzed data from patients with acute myeloid leukemia who had achieved first complete remission to assess their prognosis after first relapse. DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 70 institutions across the country on adult patients who were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and who had achieved a first complete remission after one or two courses of induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among the 1,535 patients who were treated with chemotherapy alone, 1,015 relapsed. Half of them subsequently achieved a second complete remission. The overall survival was 30% at 3 years after relapse. Multivariate analysis showed that achievement of second complete remission, salvage allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, and a relapse-free interval of 1 year or longer were independent prognostic factors. The outcome after allogeneic transplantation in second complete remission was comparable to that after transplantation in first complete remission. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and cytogenetic risk factors other than inv(16) or t(8;21) had a significantly worse outcome when they did not undergo salvage transplantation even when they achieved second complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: We found that both the achievement of second complete remission and the application of salvage transplantation were crucial for improving the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse. Our results indicate that the optimal treatment strategy after first relapse may differ according to the cytogenetic risk.","['Kurosawa, Saiko', 'Yamaguchi, Takuhiro', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Yamashita, Takuya', 'Okoshi, Yasushi', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Mawatari, Momoko', 'Hatanaka, Kazuo', 'Sunami, Kazutaka', 'Shimoyama, Manabu', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Takaue, Yoichi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro']","['Kurosawa S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Miyawaki S', 'Uchida N', 'Sakura T', 'Kanamori H', 'Usuki K', 'Yamashita T', 'Okoshi Y', 'Shibayama H', 'Nakamae H', 'Mawatari M', 'Hatanaka K', 'Sunami K', 'Shimoyama M', 'Fujishima N', 'Maeda Y', 'Miura I', 'Takaue Y', 'Fukuda T']","['Stem Cell Transplantation Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100715,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Inversion/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.027516 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.027516 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Nov;95(11):1857-64. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.027516.

The proliferative and survival signals in these proliferation centers include interactions with T lymphocytes expressing CD40 ligand. We have demonstrated that the low toxicity combination of bezafibrate and medroxyprogesterone acetate induces mitochondrial superoxide-mediated apoptosis of non-CD40-liganded cells but not of cells exposed to CD40 ligand. Here, we assessed the ability of dasatinib and lycorine to restore bezafibrate- and medroxyprogesterone acetate- induced apoptosis in cells exposed to CD40 ligand. In parallel experiments we compared the ability of dasatinib to induce apoptosis of cells co-treated with fludarabine. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to drug combinations for 72 hours on control and CD40 ligand-expressing fibroblast monolayers. Cells were harvested and analyzed for apoptosis and levels of mitochondrial superoxide using flow cytometry. In some experiments cells were removed from CD40 ligand at 48 hours, retreated and analyzed after a further 24 hours. The effect of CD40 ligand and drug treatments on mitochondrial superoxide levels were assessed. RESULTS: As previously described, dasatinib rendered cells sensitive to fludarabine but only when CD40 ligand was removed for the last 24 hours of culture. In contrast, lycorine restored the bezafibrate- and medroxyprogesterone acetate-induced apoptosis associated with mitochondrial superoxide even during continuous exposure to CD40 ligand. Furthermore, combined bezafibrate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and lycorine had little effect against normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas dasatinib with fludarabine induced high levels of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate the potential of bezafibrate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and lycorine as novel therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and have important implications for the reported potential of c-abl kinase inhibitors in this disease.","['Hayden, Rachel E', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Bunce, Chris M']","['Hayden RE', 'Pratt G', 'Drayson MT', 'Bunce CM']","['School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100715,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'I9Q105R5BU (lycorine)', 'Y9449Q51XH (Bezafibrate)']",IM,"['Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bezafibrate/*pharmacology', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'L Cells', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.027821 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.027821 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Nov;95(11):1889-96. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.027821.

Recently, we demonstrated that heparanase is involved in the regulation of the hemostatic system. Our hypothesis was that heparanase is directly involved in activation of the coagulation cascade. DESIGN AND METHODS: Activated factor X and thrombin were studied using chromogenic assays, immunoblotting and thromboelastography. Heparanase levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A potential direct interaction between tissue factor and heparanase was studied by co-immunoprecipitation and far-western assays. RESULTS: Interestingly, addition of heparanase to tissue factor and activated factor VII resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in activation of the coagulation cascade as shown by increased activated factor X and thrombin production. Culture medium of human embryonic kidney 293 cells over-expressing heparanase and its derivatives increased activated factor X levels in a non-enzymatic manner. When heparanase was added to pooled normal plasma, a 7- to 8-fold increase in activated factor X level was observed. Subsequently, we searched for clinical data supporting this newly identified role of heparanase. Plasma samples from 35 patients with acute leukemia at presentation and 20 healthy donors were studied for heparanase and activated factor X levels. A strong positive correlation was found between plasma heparanase and activated factor X levels (r=0.735, P=0.001). Unfractionated heparin and an inhibitor of activated factor X abolished the effect of heparanase, while tissue factor pathway inhibitor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 only attenuated the procoagulant effect. Using co-immunoprecipitation and far-western analyses it was shown that heparanase interacts directly with tissue factor. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support the notion that heparanase is a potential modulator of blood hemostasis, and suggest a novel mechanism by which heparanase increases the generation of activated factor X in the presence of tissue factor and activated factor VII.","['Nadir, Yona', 'Brenner, Benjamin', 'Fux, Liat', 'Shafat, Itay', 'Attias, Judith', 'Vlodavsky, Israel']","['Nadir Y', 'Brenner B', 'Fux L', 'Shafat I', 'Attias J', 'Vlodavsky I']","['Thrombosis and Hemostasis Unit, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa 31096, Israel. y_nadir@rambam.health.gov.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100715,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)', 'EC 3.4.21.6 (Factor Xa)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacology', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Factor VIIa/genetics/*metabolism', 'Factor Xa/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Glucuronidase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.023713 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.023713 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Nov;95(11):1927-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.023713.

We have expanded our analysis of these events in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) to better understand the occurrence of these events as the survivor population ages. METHODS: The incidence of and risk for subsequent neoplasms occurring 5 years or more after the childhood cancer diagnosis were determined among 14,359 5-year survivors in the CCSS who were treated from 1970 through 1986 and who were at a median age of 30 years (range = 5-56 years) for this analysis. At 30 years after childhood cancer diagnosis, we calculated cumulative incidence at 30 years of subsequent neoplasms and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), excess absolute risks (EARs) for invasive second malignant neoplasms, and relative risks for subsequent neoplasms by use of multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 14,359 5-year survivors, 1402 subsequently developed 2703 neoplasms. Cumulative incidence at 30 years after the childhood cancer diagnosis was 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.1% to 21.8%) for all subsequent neoplasms, 7.9% (95% CI = 7.2% to 8.5%) for second malignant neoplasms (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), 9.1% (95% CI = 8.1% to 10.1%) for nonmelanoma skin cancer, and 3.1% (95% CI = 2.5% to 3.8%) for meningioma. Excess risk was evident for all primary diagnoses (EAR = 2.6 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI = 2.4 to 2.9 per 1000 person-years; SIR = 6.0, 95% CI = 5.5 to 6.4), with the highest being for Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 8.7, 95% CI = 7.7 to 9.8) and Ewing sarcoma (SIR = 8.5, 95% CI = 6.2 to 11.7). In the Poisson multivariable analysis, female sex, older age at diagnosis, earlier treatment era, diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, and treatment with radiation therapy were associated with increased risk of subsequent neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: As childhood cancer survivors progress through adulthood, risk of subsequent neoplasms increases. Patients surviving Hodgkin lymphoma are at greatest risk. There is no evidence of risk reduction with increasing duration of follow-up.","['Friedman, Debra L', 'Whitton, John', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Hammond, Sue', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Donaldson, Sarah S', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Neglia, Joseph P']","['Friedman DL', 'Whitton J', 'Leisenring W', 'Mertens AC', 'Hammond S', 'Stovall M', 'Donaldson SS', 'Meadows AT', 'Robison LL', 'Neglia JP']","['Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA. debra.l.friedman@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100715,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/ethnology/therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['djq238 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djq238 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Jul 21;102(14):1083-95. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djq238.

Its profound impact on the natural history of hairy cell leukemia, with responses approaching 100% and a median duration of response of nearly a decade after only a single 7-day course, is well known and revolutionized the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. However, cladribine's impressive activity in other lymphoproliferative disorders has been generally underappreciated. Multiple single-arm phase 2 trials have demonstrated cladribine's potency across the full spectrum of lymphoid malignancies. In a limited number of phase 3 trials and cross-study analyses, cladribine compared favorably with fludarabine, another purine nucleoside analog that is more commonly used in the treatment of indolent lymphoid malignancies. Cladribine has been noted to have particular activity among lymphoid disorders with few effective therapies, specifically, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. Recently approved novel agents may act in synergy with cladribine for these conditions and should be incorporated into future clinical studies.","['Sigal, Darren S', 'Miller, Heather J', 'Schram, Ethan D', 'Saven, Alan']","['Sigal DS', 'Miller HJ', 'Schram ED', 'Saven A']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Scripps Clinic Medical Group, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100715,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31215-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-246140 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2884-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-246140.

While confirming our previous findings that high MNC OA is significantly associated with the achievement of major molecular response (MMR; P = .017), the present studies found no relationship between high CD34(+) OA and the achievement of MMR. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the MNC OA and the CD34(+) OA in matched CML samples. These results suggest that the predictive value of the MNC OA may primarily reflect the effective targeting and subsequent reduction of mature CML cells. Therefore kinase inhibition in these mature cells, and not the CD34(+) cells, may be the key determinant of response in CML.","['Engler, Jane R', 'Frede, Amity', 'Saunders, Verity', 'Zannettino, Andrew', 'White, Deborah L', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Engler JR', 'Frede A', 'Saunders V', 'Zannettino A', 'White DL', 'Hughes TP']","['Division of Haematology, SA Pathology (RAH Campus), Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100715,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31264-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-267013 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 14;116(15):2776-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-267013.

Although the pathogenesis of these disorders is poorly understood, it involves complex interactions with the host immune system. Activation of infected T cells may play an important role in disease pathogenesis through induction of the oncogenic HTLV-1 Tax transactivator protein. To test this hypothesis, we employed transgenic mice in which Tax is regulated by the HTLV-1 LTR. T-cell receptor stimulation of LTR-Tax CD4(+) T cells induced Tax expression, hyper-proliferation, and immortalization in culture. The transition to cellular immortalization was accompanied by markedly increased expression of the antiapoptotic gene, mcl-1, previously implicated as important in T-cell survival. Immortalized cells exhibited a CD4(+)CD25(+)CD3(-) phenotype commonly observed in ATL. Engraftment of activated LTR-Tax CD4(+) T cells into NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgamma null mice resulted in a leukemia-like phenotype with expansion and tissue infiltration of Tax(+), CD4(+) lymphocytes. We suggest that immune activation of infected CD4(+) T cells plays an important role in the induction of Tax expression, T-cell proliferation, and pathogenesis of ATL in HTLV-1-infected individuals.","['Swaims, Alison Y', 'Khani, Francesca', 'Zhang, Yingyu', 'Roberts, Arthur I', 'Devadas, Satish', 'Shi, Yufang', 'Rabson, Arnold B']","['Swaims AY', 'Khani F', 'Zhang Y', 'Roberts AI', 'Devadas S', 'Shi Y', 'Rabson AB']","['Child Health Institute of New Jersey, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS), New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100715,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31227-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-231050 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2994-3003. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-231050.

Therefore, we analyzed CD34(+) cells from 41 NPM1-mutated AML. At flow cytometry, 31 of 41 samples contained less than 10% cells showing low intensity CD34 positivity and variable expression of CD38. Mutational analysis and/or Western blotting of purified CD34(+) cells from 17 patients revealed NPM1-mutated gene and/or protein in all. Immunohistochemistry of trephine bone marrow biopsies and/or flow cytometry proved CD34(+) leukemia cells from NPM1-mutated AML had aberrant nucleophosmin expression in cytoplasm. NPM1-mutated gene and/or protein was also confirmed in a CD34(+) subfraction exhibiting the phenotype (CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+)/CD33(+)/CD90(-)) of leukemic stem cells. When transplanted into immunocompromised mice, CD34(+) cells generated a leukemia recapitulating, both morphologically and immunohistochemically (aberrant cytoplasmic nucleophosmin, CD34 negativity), the original patient's disease. These results indicate that the CD34(+) fraction in NPM1-mutated AML belongs to the leukemic clone and contains NPM1-mutated cells exhibiting properties typical of leukemia-initiating cells. CD34(-) cells from few cases (2/15) also showed significant leukemia-initiating cell potential in immunocompromised mice.

Recent studies indicate that OX40/OX40L system mediates the adhesion and infiltration of adult T cell leukemia (ATL). Previously, we detected OX40 expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and tissues. The correlation of expression of OX40 and OX40L and clinical features in breast carcinogenesis, however, has not been well characterized. The expression of OX40 and OX40L in 107 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCa), 9 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 31 fibroadenomas from breast tissues and its relationship with the clinical features were determined using immunohistochemistry (peroxidase-conjugated polymer method, ChemMate Envision Detection kit). The positive immunostaining rates for OX40 in IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenomas from breast tissues were 85.0%, 66.7% and 38.7% respectively, showing a significant difference in OX40 expression among IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenoma of breast (z=5.206, P=0.001). Increased staining intensity of OX40 was associated with TNM stages (z=2.112, P=0.017). Meanwhile, a relation of OX40 expression with lymph node metastatic status in IDCa was found (P=0.041). The expression of OX40L did not show any obvious difference among IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenomas from breast tissues. OX40L expression was also not related to histopathological parameters in IDCa except for progesterone receptor (PR) being positive (P=0.005). However, a high coincidental positive rate for OX40 and OX40L was observed in biopsy samples with IDCa (P=0.017, Kappa=0.231). The present results suggest that high OX40 expression may be associated with malignant transformation, progression, invasion and metastasis in breast cancer biology.","['Xie, Fang', 'Wang, Qin', 'Chen, Yongjing', 'Gu, Yongping', 'Mao, Hui', 'Zeng, Wang', 'Zhang, Xueguang']","['Xie F', 'Wang Q', 'Chen Y', 'Gu Y', 'Mao H', 'Zeng W', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Soochow University, 181 Renai Road, Suzhou 215123, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100715,Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/*metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Female', 'Fibroadenoma/metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'OX40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OX40/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/02/11 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0344-0338(10)00161-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prp.2010.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 2010 Nov 15;206(11):735-9. doi: 10.1016/j.prp.2010.05.016.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 136 Korean patients with de novo MDS between 1995 and 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. All patients were reclassified according to WHO criteria. 114 patients were included in the final analysis. An individualized age-adapted scoring system was developed to improve the accuracy of prognosis of the WPSS. RESULTS: The WPSS was significantly associated with the prediction of survival and the leukemia-free survival. While the risk of a patient with the WPSS was best represented by the values 0 (very low), +1 (low), +2 (intermediate), +3 (high), and +4 (very high), these values were found to vary between -1.0 and 4.2 in the same patients when age was included as a factor. The WPSS may vary according to age, <55 or >/=55 years. The estimated difference in median survival was more prominent in the lower risk groups of the WPSS than in the higher-risk groups. CONCLUSION: In addition to the WPSS, age was found to significantly influence the prognosis of patients with MDS and provided a more individualized prognosis for the patients with MDS.","['Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Lee, Ji Hyun', 'Choi, Jimin', 'Kwon, Kyung A', 'Lee, Suee', 'Oh, Sung Yong', 'Kwon, Hyuk-Chan', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Kim, Hyo-Jin']","['Kim SH', 'Lee JH', 'Choi J', 'Kwon KA', 'Lee S', 'Oh SY', 'Kwon HC', 'Han JY', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100714,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'World Health Organization']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00122-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Dec;34(12):1589-95. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.003.

The sole cytogenetic abnormality observed in bone marrow-derived metaphases was a t(4;11)(q21;q23), which is a frequently occurring translocation in ALL. However, subsequent reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the expected mixed lineage leukemia [trithorax homolog, Drosophila] (MLL)-AFF1 fusion transcript was negative. Further fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis narrowed the 4q21 breakpoint down to a 250-kb region proximal of AFF1. This comprised four genes, of which septin11 (SEPT11) was further analyzed. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed expression of a chimeric MLL-SEPT11 transcript, thus identifying what is to our knowledge a hitherto undescribed translocation in ALL. Sequence analysis of cDNA showed in-frame fusion of MLL exon 11 to SEPT11 exon 2. This MLL-SEPT11 fusion is cytogenetically indistinguishable from the recurrent t(4;11)(q21;q23). Thus, it is crucial to characterize cytogenetic aberrations in leukemia by molecular methods, even in cases where a known recurrent translocation is presumed. This report expands the spectrum of ALL-related translocations and hypothesizes on the mechanism leading to the MLL-SEPT11 fusion. Five septins have been identified thus far as MLL fusion partners in leukemia. Their putative oncogenic role may be related to forced MLL dimerization by the septin coiled coil and GTP-binding domains, which could convert MLL to an oncogene.","['Stevens, Servi J C', 'Meers, Laurence E C', 'Albrechts, Jozefa C M', 'Mebis-Verhees, Karien', 'Bos, Gerard M J', 'Engelen, John J M', 'Janssen, Jannie W H']","['Stevens SJ', 'Meers LE', 'Albrechts JC', 'Mebis-Verhees K', 'Bos GM', 'Engelen JJ', 'Janssen JW']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Unit of Cytogenetics, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands. servi.stevens@gen.unimaas.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Fusion', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Septins', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00194-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Aug;201(1):48-51. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.05.002.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study was to identify the most cytotoxic constituents of a water extract (a decoction is traditionally used as a treatment) by HPLC and activity-guided fractionation. The bioavailability of the decoction and certain fractions, and the mode of cell death induced by these mixtures, were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decoction of O. diffusa was prepared and separated by HPLC into eleven fractions (F1-11) for testing on the growth of HL60 leukaemia cells; two of the most active fractions were also tested on Caco-2 colon cancer cells. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion, DNA content (Cyquant NF assay) and neutral red uptake. Evidence of apoptosis was gained from cells stained with the nuclear dye DAPI, and detection of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by Western blot. RESULTS: Fraction 9 was found to be the most active fraction, and, along with the decoction, induced apoptosis. Cells stained with DAPI showed a decrease in cell size and nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. Detection of cleaved PARP further confirmed induction of apoptosis by O. diffusa decoction and fraction 9. The bioavailability of O. diffusa was investigated by production of post-absorption samples using Caco-2 intestinal epithelial monolayers. Addition of post-absorption samples (taken from the basolateral side after 3h incubation with the decoction on the apical side) inhibited the growth of HL60 cells, and suggested a degree of bioavailability. The constituents in fraction 9 were further separated by HPLC and eight major compounds were identified by LC-MS: two of these were ursolic acid (UA) and its enantiomer oleanolic acid (OA). Concentrations of UA and OA in the decoction were then calculated by reference to the area of the peaks of UA and OA found in F9. The post-absorption sample of F9 contained six of the eight constituents in the original pre-absorption fraction 9. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results suggest that certain constituents, possibly including ursolic/oleanolic acid, may be bioavailable and at sufficient concentration to induce apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro through a mechanism including the cleavage of PARP.","['Ganbold, Munkhchimeg', 'Barker, James', 'Ma, Ren', 'Jones, Lucy', 'Carew, Mark']","['Ganbold M', 'Barker J', 'Ma R', 'Jones L', 'Carew M']","['School of Pharmacy & Chemistry, Kingston University, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100713,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biological Availability', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oldenlandia/*chemistry', 'Oleanolic Acid/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phytotherapy', 'Triterpenes/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(10)00476-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2010 Sep 15;131(2):396-403. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.014.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis induction by gossypol in malignant cells have not been completely enunciated. Here we investigate the alterations of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 protein levels and Bcl-2 phosphorylation in gossypol-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. We found that gossypol treatment inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 protein levels were slightly reduced and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at threonine 56 (phospho T56) was not altered. However, phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at serine 70 (phospho S70) was strikingly down-regulated in gossypol-exposed cells. This reduction was found to be not only in both dose- and time-dependent fashion but also obviated by phorbol l2,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). In addition, pre-treatment of PDBu partially prevented gossypol-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Collectively, gossypol treatment can reduce phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at serine 70 in leukemia HL-60 cells and gossypol may be a promising therapeutical candidate for leukemia patients especially expressing phosphorylated Bcl-2 at Ser70.","['Huang, Li-heng', 'Hu, Jia-qi', 'Tao, Wei-qun', 'Li, Yuan-hong', 'Li, Guan-ming', 'Xie, Pei-yi', 'Liu, Xiao-shan', 'Jiang, Jikai']","['Huang LH', 'Hu JQ', 'Tao WQ', 'Li YH', 'Li GM', 'Xie PY', 'Liu XS', 'Jiang J']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shantou University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100713,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2010/07/17 06:00,2011/01/20 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(10)00679-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.070 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Oct 25;645(1-3):9-13. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.070.

Besides the general modifiers of apoptosis, several tissue-specific regulators of this process were identified including HAX1 (HS-1 associated protein X-1) - an anti-apoptotic factor active in myeloid cells. Although HAX1 was the subject of various experimental studies, the mechanisms of its action and a functional link connected with the regulation of apoptosis still remains highly speculative. FINDINGS: Here we provide the data which suggests that HAX1 may act as a regulator or as a sensor of calcium. On the basis of iterative similarity searches, we identified a set of distant homologs of HAX1 in insects. The applied fold recognition protocol gives us strong evidence that the distant insects' homologs of HAX1 are novel parvalbumin-like calcium binding proteins. Although the whole three EF-hands fold is not preserved in vertebrate our analysis suggests that there is an existence of a potential single EF-hand calcium binding site in HAX1. The molecular mechanism of its action remains to be identified, but the risen hypothesis easily translates into previously reported lines of various data on the HAX1 biology as well as, provides us a direct link to the regulation of apoptosis. Moreover, we also report that other family of myeloid specific apoptosis regulators - myeloid leukemia factors (MLF1, MLF2) share the homologous C-terminal domain and taxonomic distribution with HAX1. CONCLUSIONS: Performed structural and active sites analyses gave new insights into mechanisms of HAX1 and MLF families in apoptosis process and suggested possible role of HAX1 in calcium-binding, still the analyses require further experimental verification.","['Kokoszynska, Katarzyna', 'Rychlewski, Leszek', 'Wyrwicz, Lucjan S']","['Kokoszynska K', 'Rychlewski L', 'Wyrwicz LS']","['Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Roentgena 5, 02-781 Warsaw, Poland. lucjan@bioinfo.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100715,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,,,2010/07/17 06:00,2010/07/17 06:01,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-0500-3-197 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0500-3-197 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2010 Jul 15;3:197. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-3-197.,,,,PMC2914655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a case of Imatinib-treated CML in which intradermally administered WT1 peptide vaccine elicited WT1-specific immune responses and the resultant reduction in the persistent residual disease in co-administration of Imatinib. BCR-ABL mRNA levels were being maintained under the detection limit for 8 months since week 77 of vaccination. No adverse effects except local erythema at the injection sites were observed. The tetramer assay revealed that the decrease in BCR-ABL mRNA levels was associated with the increase in frequency of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, notably effector-memory type of that, in the patient's peripheral blood. The case presented here indicates that WT1 peptide vaccine may become a safe and cure-oriented therapy for CML patients who have residual disease regardless of the treatment with Imatinib.","['Oji, Yusuke', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Shirakata, Toshiaki', 'Takahashi, Kazuko', 'Murao, Ayako', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Takahashi, Masuhiro', 'Morita, Satoshi', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Tanaka, Toshio', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Oji Y', 'Oka Y', 'Nishida S', 'Tsuboi A', 'Kawakami M', 'Shirakata T', 'Takahashi K', 'Murao A', 'Nakajima H', 'Narita M', 'Takahashi M', 'Morita S', 'Sakamoto J', 'Tanaka T', 'Kawase I', 'Hosen N', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology Respiratory Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines/chemistry/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology/therapeutic use', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*immunology']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1497 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01497.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Oct;85(4):358-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01497.x.

Studies have demonstrated that arsenic trioxide slows cancer cells growth. Although arsenic influences numerous signal-transduction pathways, cell-cycle progression, and/or apoptosis, its apoptotic mechanisms are complex and not entirely delineated. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of arsenic trioxide on DNA synthesis and to determine whether arsenic-induced apoptosis is mediated via caspase activation, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and cell cycle arrest. To achieve this goal, lung cancer cells (A549) were exposed to various concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 microg/mL) of arsenic trioxide for 48 h. The effect of arsenic trioxide on DNA synthesis was determined by the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Apoptosis was determined by the caspase-3 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) assay, p38 MAP kinase activity was determined by an immunoblot assay, and cell-cycle analysis was evaluated by the propidium iodide assay. The [3H]thymidine-incorporation assay revealed a dose-related cytotoxic response at high levels of exposure. Furthermore, arsenic trioxide modulated caspase 3 activity and induced p38 MAP kinase activation in A549 cells. However, cell-cycle studies showed no statistically significant differences in DNA content at subG1 check point between control and arsenic trioxide treated cells.","['Walker, Alice M', 'Stevens, Jacqueline J', 'Ndebele, Kenneth', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Walker AM', 'Stevens JJ', 'Ndebele K', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Molecular Toxicology Research Laboratory, NIH RCMI-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39217, USA. alice.m.walker@jsums.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2010/07/17 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/07/17 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2010 May;7(5):1996-2007.,,,"['G12 RR013459/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5G12RR013459-12/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2864039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however imatinib resistance and intolerance have been detected in many patients. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are required. The present work aimed at the development and application of transferrin receptor (TrfR) targeted liposomes co-encapsulating anti-BCR-ABL siRNA and imatinib at different molar ratios. The encapsulation yields and drug loading of each molecule was evaluated. Anti-leukemia activity of the developed formulations co-encapsulating siRNA and imatinib and of the combination of Trf-liposomes carrying siRNA and free imatinib under two different treatment schedules of pre-sensitization was assessed. The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of imatinib significantly decreases the encapsulation yields of siRNA, whereas imatinib encapsulation yields are increased by the presence of siRNA. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrate that the formulations co-encapsulating siRNA and imatinib promote a 3.84-fold reduction on the imatinib IC(50) (from 3.49 to 0.91 microM), whereas a 8.71-fold reduction was observed for the pre-sensitization protocols (from 42.7 to 4.9 nM). It was also observed that the formulations with higher siRNA to imatinib molar ratios promote higher cell toxicity. Thus, the present work describes a novel triple targeting strategy with one single system: cellular targeting (through the targeting ligand, transferrin) and molecular targeting at the BCR-ABL mRNA and Bcr-Abl protein level.","['Mendonca, Liliana S', 'Moreira, Joao N', 'de Lima, Maria C Pedroso', 'Simoes, Sergio']","['Mendonca LS', 'Moreira JN', 'de Lima MC', 'Simoes S']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Coimbra, Polo das Ciencias da Saude, Azinhaga de Santa Comba, 3000-548 Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transferrin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Carriers/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Liposomes/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Piperazines/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/analysis/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",2010/07/16 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.22858 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2010 Dec 1;107(5):884-93. doi: 10.1002/bit.22858.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiparametric flow cytometry (FC) is a rapid and sensitive methodology for detection of MRD, applicable for most patients and is being incorporated in multicenter treatment protocols. The influence of different techniques and of individual interpretation of data on the interlaboratory variability in FC-MRD determinations has not been described. METHODS: We compared FC-MRD of identical bone marrow samples processed as either Ficoll separated mononuclear cells or lyse and wash nucleated cells (NC) in two central laboratories of a national multicenter childhood ALL study. A total of 290 samples at diagnosis and 494 follow-up samples (Day-15 n = 261; Day-33 n = 233) were analyzed. A group of 52 paired list mode data (LMD) of D-15 and D-33 samples was blindly reanalyzed by both laboratories. RESULTS: Pearson correlations for all samples of D-15 (n = 261) and D-33 (n = 233) were 0.875 and 0.82, respectively (P < 0.001), being lower for T-ALL 0.716 and 0.719, respectively. Quantitative concordance defined as less than 0.5 log difference in MRD measured by the two methodologies was 80.8% at D-15 but only in 57.9% at D-33. Reanalysis of LMD revealed that data interpretation explained half of the discordance. CONCLUSIONS: FC-MRD analysis of childhood ALL is a robust method during the earliest phases of induction therapy in a multicentric setting. Standardization of data analysis could improve about half of the discordance between different technical approaches.","['Luria, Drorit', 'Rosenthal, Eti', 'Steinberg, David', 'Kodman, Yona', 'Safanaiev, Marina', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Avigad, Smadar', 'Stark, Batia', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Luria D', 'Rosenthal E', 'Steinberg D', 'Kodman Y', 'Safanaiev M', 'Amariglio N', 'Avigad S', 'Stark B', 'Izraeli S']","[""Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In this study, the FR-beta expression and the modulation effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in a number of cancer cell lines were analyzed. The gateway of ATRA activity on FR-beta expression was further studied by a panel of retinoid activators and inhibitors. The results revealed that ATRA was capable of upregulating the expression of FR-beta protein in KG-1 cells in a dosage-dependent manner, not in KG-1a, NB4, HL60, 293, L1210, JAR, and Hela cells. FR-beta mRNA expression in KG-1 cells was higher when ATRA was present in culture medium at 10(-)(6) mol/L for 5 days, and it went down to baseline when ATRA was removed from the medium, vice versa. The upregulation of FR-beta expression in KG-1 cells by ATRA was not associated with cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, activators of retinoid acid receptor (RAR)alpha and RARgamma, CD336, and CD2781 also induced FR-beta expression. The induction of FR-beta expression by CD336 could be inhibited by RARgamma antagonist CD2665; RARbeta agonist CD-417 and CD-2314 as well as retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist LG100364 could not induce FR-beta expression. These results indicate that ATRA within a certain range of concentration could reversibly induce the expression of FR-beta in a dosage- and cell type-dependent manner, and its action in KG-1 cells might be associated with the signal transduction of retinoid receptor RARalpha and RARgamma, rather than RARbeta and RXRs.","['Xu, Ying', 'Wang, Tianyou', 'Tang, Ruihong', 'Tang, Suoqin']","['Xu Y', 'Wang T', 'Tang R', 'Tang S']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Clinical Division of Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100715,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Folate Receptor 2)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cervix Uteri/metabolism/pathology', 'Choriocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-010-0074-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2010 Dec;31(6):589-95. doi: 10.1007/s13277-010-0074-0.

Various physiological functions of Bestatin have been identified, viz.: (1) an immunomodifier for enhancing the proliferation of normal human bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells to form CFU-GM colonies; Bestatin exerts a direct stimulating effect on lymphocytes via its fixation on the cell surface and an indirect effect on monocytes via aminopeptidase B inhibition of tuftsin catabolism; (2) an immunorestorator and curative or preventive agent for spontaneous tumor; Bestatin alone or its combination with chemicals can prolongate the disease-free interval and survival period in adult acute or chronic leukemia, therefore, it was primarily marketed in 1987 in Japan as an anticancer drug and servers as the only marketed inhibitor of Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) to cure leukemia to date; (3) a pan-hematopoietic stimulator and restorator; Bestatin promotes granulocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis in vitro and restores them in myelo-hypoplastic men; (4) an inhibitor of several natural opioid peptides. Based on the knowledge that APN can cleave several bioactive neuropeptides such as Met-enkaphalins, Leu-enkaphalins, beta-Endorphin, and so on, the anti-aminopeptidase action of Bestatin also allows it to protect endopeptides against their catabolism, exhibiting analgesic activity. Although many scientific studies and great accomplishments have been achieved in this field, a large amount of problems are unsolved. This article reviews the promising results obtained for future development of the analgesic activity of Bestatin that can be of vital interest in a number of severe and chronic pain syndromes.","['Jia, Mei-Rong', 'Wei, Tao', 'Xu, Wen-Fang']","['Jia MR', 'Wei T', 'Xu WF']","['School of Pharmacy, Shandong University Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100628,Switzerland,Front Neurosci,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,,,,2010/07/16 06:00,2010/07/16 06:01,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnins.2010.00050 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurosci. 2010 Jun 28;4:50. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2010.00050. eCollection 2010.,,,,PMC2903224,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bestatin', 'analgesic activity', 'application', 'mechanism', 'neuropeptides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clofarabine is a hybrid of fludarabine and cladribine, and has shown to have antileukemic activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as in myeloid disorders. As the only new antileukemic chemotherapeutic agent to enter clinical use in the last 10 years, clofarabine was approved as an orphan drug with the primary indication of use in pediatric patients. Toxicity has been tolerable in a heavily pretreated patient population, and clofarabine has been demonstrated to be safe, both as a single agent and in combination therapies. Liver dysfunction has been the most frequently observed adverse event, but this is generally reversible. Numerous Phase I and II trials have recently been conducted, and are still ongoing in an effort to find the optimal role for clofarabine in various treatment strategies. Concomitant use of clofarabine, cytarabine, and etoposide was confirmed to be safe and effective in two independent trials.

Translocation (11;14)(p13;q11) has been predominantly found in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) but is rare in B-cell ALL. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 30-year-old male patient, who presented with symptomatic anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Bone marrow aspirate smear showed hypercellularity with 90.4% of blast cells, which were negative for peroxidase reaction and partially positive for periodic acid-Schiff reaction. Immunophenotyping analysis was positive for CD34, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD19, CD22, cCD79c, and negative for CD2, CD3, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD20, cCD3. Conventional cytogenetic study by R-banding showed complex chromosome aberrations involving t(11;14)(p13;q11) with the following karyotype: 46,XY,t (11;14)(p13;q11)[2]/46,idem,add2(q?)[2]/46,XY,add16(p?) [3]/46,XY[13]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis indicated the translocation of chromosomes 11 and 14, and was negative for BCR/ABL fusion. The patient went into complete remission after the first induction chemotherapy (ALL-IC-BFM 2002 regimen), but he relapsed and died after 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Translocation (11;14) (p13;q11) in B-cell ALL is rare, but it is worth exploring the molecular mechanisms and discovering the prognostic value in more B-cell ALL patients.","['Miao, Kourong', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Qiu, Hairong', 'Zhang, Run', 'Chen, Lijuan', 'Wu, Hanxin', 'Wang, Rong', 'Zhang, Jianfu']","['Miao K', 'Li J', 'Qiu H', 'Zhang R', 'Chen L', 'Wu H', 'Wang R', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100622,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['000315753 [pii]', '10.1159/000315753 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2010;33(7):385-7. doi: 10.1159/000315753.

To explore the impact of Mcl-1 overexpression on the hematopoietic compartment, we have generated vavP-Mcl-1 transgenic mice. Their lymphoid and myeloid cells displayed increased resistance to a variety of cytotoxic agents. Myelopoiesis was relatively normal, but lymphopoiesis was clearly perturbed, with excess mature B and T cells accumulating. Rather than the follicular lymphomas typical of vavP-BCL-2 mice, aging vavP-Mcl-1 mice were primarily susceptible to lymphomas having the phenotype of a stem/progenitor cell (11 of 30 tumors) or pre-B cell (12 of 30 tumors). Mcl-1 overexpression dramatically accelerated Myc-driven lymphomagenesis. Most vavP-Mcl-1/ Emu-Myc mice died around birth, and transplantation of blood from bitransgenic E18 embryos into unirradiated mice resulted in stem/progenitor cell tumors. Furthermore, lethally irradiated mice transplanted with E13 fetal liver cells from Mcl-1/Myc bitransgenic mice uniformly died of stem/progenitor cell tumors. When treated in vivo with cyclophosphamide, tumors coexpressing Mcl-1 and Myc transgenes were significantly more resistant than conventional Emu-Myc lymphomas.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events, defined by grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia starting on day 15 of the first cycle or platelet transfusion at any time during the 4-cycle treatment period. No formal hypothesis testing was planned. The incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events in patients receiving romiplostim 500 mug, romiplostim 750 mug, or placebo was 62%, 71%, and 85%, respectively. The incidence of platelet transfusions was 46%, 36%, and 69%, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant with the small numbers in each group. Romiplostim 750 mug significantly raised median platelet counts during cycle 3 on day 1 (P = .0373) and at the nadir (P = .0035) compared with placebo.

Here, in a phase I/II trial, we investigated the effect of autologous dendritic cell vaccination in 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1), a nearly universal tumor antigen, was chosen as an immunotherapeutic target because of its established role in leukemogenesis and superior immunogenic characteristics. Two patients in partial remission after chemotherapy were brought into complete remission after intradermal administration of full-length WT1 mRNA-electroporated dendritic cells. In these two patients and three other patients who were in complete remission, the AML-associated tumor marker returned to normal after dendritic cell vaccination, compatible with the induction of molecular remission. Clinical responses were correlated with vaccine-associated increases in WT1-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies, as detected by peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramer staining, and elevated levels of activated natural killer cells postvaccination. Furthermore, vaccinated patients showed increased levels of WT1-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells and features of general immune activation. These data support the further development of vaccination with WT1 mRNA-loaded dendritic cells as a postremission treatment to prevent full relapse in AML patients.","['Van Tendeloo, Viggo F', 'Van de Velde, Ann', 'Van Driessche, Ann', 'Cools, Nathalie', 'Anguille, Sebastien', 'Ladell, Kristin', 'Gostick, Emma', 'Vermeulen, Katrien', 'Pieters, Katrien', 'Nijs, Griet', 'Stein, Barbara', 'Smits, Evelien L', 'Schroyens, Wilfried A', 'Gadisseur, Alain P', 'Vrelust, Inge', 'Jorens, Philippe G', 'Goossens, Herman', 'de Vries, I Jolanda', 'Price, David A', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo', 'Berneman, Zwi N']","['Van Tendeloo VF', 'Van de Velde A', 'Van Driessche A', 'Cools N', 'Anguille S', 'Ladell K', 'Gostick E', 'Vermeulen K', 'Pieters K', 'Nijs G', 'Stein B', 'Smits EL', 'Schroyens WA', 'Gadisseur AP', 'Vrelust I', 'Jorens PG', 'Goossens H', 'de Vries IJ', 'Price DA', 'Oji Y', 'Oka Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Berneman ZN']","['University of Antwerp, Faculty of Medicine, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute (Vaxinfectio) and Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp B-2650, Belgium.

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analyses showed that PRDX1 was located in the cytoplasm and nucleus of normal and breast cancer cells, with nuclear PRDX1 associated with promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies. We demonstrated that PRDX1 association with the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF7 cells contributed to PRDX1-selective recruitment to MDA-MB-231 genomic DNA. Furthermore, PRDX1 was associated with the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 upstream promoter region at sites occupied by NF-kappaB in ER- but not in ER+ breast cancer cells. PRDX1 knockdown attenuated COX-2 expression by reducing NF-kappaB occupancy at its upstream promoter element in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF7 cells. A phosphorylated form of PRDX1 was only present in ER- breast cancer cells. Because PRDX1 phosphorylation is known to inhibit its peroxidase activity and to promote PRDX1 oligomerization, we propose that PRDX1 acts as a chaperone to enhance the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB in ER- breast cancer cells.","['Wang, Xuemei', 'He, Shihua', 'Sun, Jian-Min', 'Delcuve, Genevieve P', 'Davie, James R']","['Wang X', 'He S', 'Sun JM', 'Delcuve GP', 'Davie JR']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E0V9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100714,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*metabolism']",2010/07/16 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['E10-02-0160 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E10-02-0160 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2010 Sep 1;21(17):2987-95. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E10-02-0160.

This study developed MCMVs with an EGFP-fused IE3 gene in order to study IE3 gene expression, subnuclear distribution and biological function, as well as to examine the interaction of IE3 with cellular and viral proteins. The generated viruses included MCMVIE3gfp, in which IE1 was completely removed by the in-frame fusion of exons 3 and 5 and the C terminus of IE3 was tagged with EGFP, and MCMVIE1/3gfp, in which IE1 was kept intact and EGFP was also fused to the C terminus of IE3. Unlike human CMV (HCMV), whose growth was significantly reduced when IE2 (the HCMV homologue of IE3 in MCMV) was tagged with EGFP, MCMVs with IE3-EGFP presented an unchanged replication profile. Using these new constructs, the distribution of IE3 was revealed as well as its interaction with viral and cellular proteins, especially proteins pertaining to DNA replication (M44 and E1) and cellular intrinsic defence [promyelocytic leukemia protein and histone deacetylases (HDACs)]. It was also shown that IE3 domains co-localize with DNA replication domains, and IE3 attracted other required proteins into IE3 domains via protein-protein interactions. In addition, IE3 was shown to interact with HDAC2 and to eliminate the inhibitory effect of HDAC2 on early viral gene production. Together, these results suggest that IE3 acts as a key protein for viral DNA replication by establishing pre-replication domains via recruitment of the required viral and cellular proteins, and by reducing host defences.","['Martinez, Francisco Puerta', 'Cosme, Ruth S Cruz', 'Tang, Qiyi']","['Martinez FP', 'Cosme RS', 'Tang Q']","['Department of Microbiology/RCMI Program, Ponce School of Medicine, Ponce, PR 00716, Puerto Rico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100714,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (IE3 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Muromegalovirus/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['vir.0.022301-0 [pii]', '10.1099/vir.0.022301-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2010 Nov;91(Pt 11):2664-76. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.022301-0.

Oxidative stress or inhibitor-induced GSTP1-1 oligomerization leads to the activation of stress cascades and apoptosis in various tumor cells. Therefore, bivalent glutathione transferase (GST) inhibitors with the potential to interact with GST dimers are been sought as pharmacological and/or therapeutic agents. Here we have characterized GSTP1-1 oligomerization in response to various endogenous and exogenous agents. Ethacrynic acid, a classic GSTP1-1 inhibitor, 4-hydroxy-nonenal, hydrogen peroxide, and diamide all induced reversible GSTP1-1 oligomerization in Jurkat leukemia cells through the formation of disulphide bonds involving Cys47 and/or Cys101, as suggested by reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cysteine to serine mutants. Remarkably, the electrophilic prostanoid 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) induced irreversible GSTP1-1 oligomerization, specifically involving Cys101, a residue present in the human but not in the murine enzyme. 15d-PGJ(2)-induced GSTP1-1 cross-linking required the prostaglandin (PG) dienone structure and was associated with sustained c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation and induction of apoptosis. It is noteworthy that 15d-PGJ(2) elicited GSTP1-1 cross-linking in vitro, a process that could be mimicked by other dienone cyclopentenone PG, such as Delta(12)-PGJ(2), and by the bifunctional thiol reagent dibromobimane, suggesting that cyclopentenone PG may be directly involved in oligomer formation. Remarkably, Delta(12)-PGJ(2)-induced oligomeric species were clearly observed by electron microscopy showing dimensions compatible with GSTP1-1 tetramers. These results provide the first direct visualization of GSTP1-1 oligomeric species. Moreover, they offer novel strategies for the modulation of GSTP1-1 cellular functions, which could be exploited to overcome its role in cancer chemoresistance.","['Sanchez-Gomez, Francisco J', 'Diez-Dacal, Beatriz', 'Pajares, Maria A', 'Llorca, Oscar', 'Perez-Sala, Dolores']","['Sanchez-Gomez FJ', 'Diez-Dacal B', 'Pajares MA', 'Llorca O', 'Perez-Sala D']","['Department of Chemical and Physical Biology, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu, 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100714,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'Q0U2IGF9CK (cyclopentenone)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Prostaglandins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.110.065391 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.110.065391 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 Oct;78(4):723-33. doi: 10.1124/mol.110.065391.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain their genesis. Recently, our group showed that the MYC-containing dmin in leukemia cases arise by excision and amplification (episome model). In the present paper we investigated 10 cell lines from solid tumors showing MYCN amplification as dmin or hsr. Particularly revealing results were provided by the two subclones of the neuroblastoma cell line STA-NB-10, one showing dmin-only and the second hsr-only amplification. Both subclones showed a deletion, at 2p24.3, whose extension matched the amplicon extension. Additionally, the amplicon structure of the dmin and hsr forms was identical. This strongly argues that the episome model, already demonstrated in leukemias, applies to solid tumors as well, and that dmin and hsr are two faces of the same coin. The organization of the duplicated segments varied from very simple (no apparent changes from the normal sequence) to very complex. MYCN was always overexpressed (significantly overexpressed in three cases).

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major physiological inhibitor for fibrinolysis, and it is also implicated in inflammation and tissue remodeling. Increased levels of PAI-1 and glycated low-density lipoprotein (glyLDL) were detected in patients with diabetes. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) is involved in glyLDL-induced PAI-1 overproduction in vascular endothelial cells (EC). The present study investigated transmembrane signaling mechanisms involved in glyLDL-induced HSF1 and PAI-1 up-regulation in cultured human vascular EC and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) antibody prevented glyLDL-induced increase in the abundance of PAI-1 in EC. GlyLDL significantly increased the translocation of V-Ha-Ras Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (H-Ras) from cytoplasm to membrane compared with LDL. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor-277 or small interference RNA against H-Ras inhibited glyLDL-induced increases in HSF1 and PAI-1 in EC. Treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) inhibitor, blocked glyLDL-induced translocation of H-Ras, elevated abundances of HSF1 and PAI-1 in EC, and increased release of hydrogen peroxide from EC. Small interference RNA for p22(phox) prevented glyLDL-induced expression of NOX2, HSF1, and PAI-1 in EC. GlyLDL significantly increased V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (Raf-1) phosphorylation. Treatment with Raf-1 inhibitor blocked glyLDL-induced increase of PAI-1 mRNA in EC. The levels of RAGE, H-Ras, NOX4, HSF1, and PAI-1 were increased in hearts of streptozotocin-diabetic mice and positively correlated with plasma glucose. The results suggest that RAGE, NOX, and H-Ras/Raf-1 are implicated in the up-regulation of HSF1 or PAI-1 in vascular EC under diabetes-associated metabolic stress.","['Sangle, Ganesh V', 'Zhao, Ruozhi', 'Mizuno, Tooru M', 'Shen, Garry X']","['Sangle GV', 'Zhao R', 'Mizuno TM', 'Shen GX']","['Department of Physiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3P4.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100714,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hsf1 protein, rat)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (glycated lipoproteins, LDL)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (CYBA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/blood/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycation End Products, Advanced', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Streptozocin', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['en.2010-0323 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2010-0323 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2010 Sep;151(9):4455-66. doi: 10.1210/en.2010-0323.

Donor NK cell ""alloeffector"" responses are exploited in haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat leukaemia. NK cells also express several toll-like receptors (TLRs) that increase NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release in response to ligands. Surprisingly, KIR3DL2 binds the TLR ligand CpG-oligodexynucleotides, and together, they are co-internalized and translocated to TLR9-rich early endosomes.

DESIGN: Database study and review of the literature. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six case reports from spontaneous reporting systems and the literature. METHODS: Case reports from a review of the literature were combined with spontaneous reports from the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects, the World Health Organization, and the Food and Drug Administration looking for reports on interferon therapy associated with optic neuropathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data from the spontaneous reports include the type of interferon, age, gender, adverse drug reaction (ADR), dosage, duration of therapy until onset of ADR, concomitant drugs, systemic disease, and dechallenge and rechallenge data. RESULTS: Thirty-six case reports of AION are described in association with interferon alfa therapy. The average age of subjects was 54.5 years; 26 were male and 10 were female. The median duration of therapy to onset of AION was 4.5 months, with 50% of subjects having some form of permanent vision loss. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was bilateral in 67% of subjects. There are 3 positive rechallenge case reports. CONCLUSIONS: Interferon alfa's association with AION can be classified as ""possible"" using the World Health Organization classification system. If optic neuropathy is suspected, rapid cessation of interferon therapy may portend a better prognosis because multiple case reports indicate visual defects may be permanent if this possible ADR remains unrecognized.","['Fraunfelder, F W', 'Fraunfelder, F T']","['Fraunfelder FW', 'Fraunfelder FT']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239-4197, USA. eyedrug@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100714,United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic/*chemically induced']",2010/07/16 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2009/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-6420(10)00382-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.03.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 2011 Feb;118(2):408-11.e1-2. doi: 10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.03.063.

Recently, MBL has been shown to be a precursor state for CLL, though most MBLs presumably do not progress to CLL. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in the biology of MBL to better understand the mechanisms of CLL leukemogenesis. We have investigated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene usage and clonality in MBL. These investigations reveal that most MBLs use mutated heavy chains typically associated with good-risk CLL, and that MBLs are frequently oligoclonal, rather than monoclonal. Deletion of chromosome 13q14 is also commonly observed. These and other ongoing studies may help illuminate the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Lanasa, Mark C', 'Allgood, Sallie D', 'Weinberg, J Brice']","['Lanasa MC', 'Allgood SD', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. mark.lanasa@duke.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/*pathology']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.496018 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Aug;51(8):1386-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.496018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggest that ribavirin may also be an effective cancer therapy. In this case, ribavirin targets an oncogene, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, elevated in approximately 30% of cancers including many leukemias and lymphomas. Specifically, ribavirin impedes eIF4E mediated oncogenic transformation by acting as an inhibitor of eIF4E. In a phase II clinical trial, ribavirin treatment led to substantial clinical benefit in patients with poor-prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here molecular targeting of eIF4E correlated with clinical response. Ribavirin also targets a key enzyme in the guanosine biosynthetic pathway, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and also modulates immunity. Parallels with known antiviral mechanisms could be informative; however, after 40 years, these are not entirely clear. The antiviral effects of ribavirin appear cell-type specific. This variation likely arises for many reasons, including cell specific variations in ribavirin metabolism as well as virus specific factors. Thus, it seems that the mechanisms for ribavirin action in cancer therapy may also vary in terms of the cancer/tissue under study. Here we review the anticancer activities of ribavirin and discuss the possible utility of incorporating ribavirin into diverse cancer therapeutic regimens.","['Borden, Katherine L B', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic, Biljana']","['Borden KL', 'Culjkovic-Kraljacic B']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. katherine.borden@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Ribavirin/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",2010/07/16 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.496506 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Oct;51(10):1805-15. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.496506.,,,"['R01 CA080728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0198571/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 80728/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC2950216,,,,['NIHMS219711'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this single-center retrospective study was to determine the impact of pre-transplant IA on the outcome of allo-SCT after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). Twenty-eight cases of proven or probable IA were diagnosed prior to RIC allo-SCT at the Paoli-Calmettes Institute Cancer Center between January 2000 and January 2008. These cases were identified among 360 patients undergoing allo-SCT. IA was defined according to EORTC criteria. Patients had predominantly (82%) acute myeloid leukemia, were diagnosed with IA at a median of 8 months (range, 1-16) pre-transplant, and received antifungal therapy for a median of 5 months (range, 1-13). IA therapy included: voriconazole (71%); single-agent itraconazole (14%); and a combination of agents (14%). Secondary prophylaxis against aspergillosis was maintained during conditioning and post-transplant in 89% of patients. After transplant, only three patients (11%) had reactivation of their IA and one patient developed disseminated fusariosis. The latter four patients experienced severe acute GVHD treated with high-dose corticosteroids. None of these patients died of IA. Eighteen patients (64%) are still alive, with a median follow-up of 23.5 months (range, 12.6-48.5). Overall survival at 2 years was 59% (95% CI, 43-83%). These data suggest that patients with adequately controlled IA can tolerate RIC allo-SCT without significant post-transplant complications.","['El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Wang, Ling', 'Esterni, Benjamin', 'Faucher, Catherine', 'Furst, Sabine', 'Pierre, Berger', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Blaise, Didier']","['El-Cheikh J', 'Castagna L', 'Wang L', 'Esterni B', 'Faucher C', 'Furst S', 'Pierre B', 'Mohty M', 'Blaise D']","['Unite de Transplantation et de Therapie Cellulaire (UTTC), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France. elcheikhj@marseille.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Aspergillus/*pathogenicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*microbiology/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.500433 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Sep;51(9):1705-10. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.500433.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in cell morphology and expression of alpha-SMA were evaluated with electronic microscope and Western blot respectively. The collagen I in the supernatant was detected with ABC-ELISA. RESULTS: TGF-beta1 induced renal interstitial fibroblast activation, and this was accompanied by significant morphological transformations and secretion of collagen I. Co-culturing of cells with LIF blocked the morphological transformation. In addition, LIF inhibited TGF-beta1-induced expression of alpha-SMA mRNA and protein (P < 0.01), and decreased the levels of collagen I (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: LIF suppresses TGF-beta1-induced activation and collagen I secretion of cultured renal interstitial fibroblasts.","['Liu, Chang', 'Wang, Li', 'Xie, Xi-Sheng', 'Xie, Lin-Shen', 'Li, Fei-Yan', 'Wang, Feng-Ping', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, He-Ping', 'Fan, Jun-Ming']","['Liu C', 'Wang L', 'Xie XS', 'Xie LS', 'Li FY', 'Wang FP', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang HP', 'Fan JM']","['Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

It is metabolized by CYP3A4, is highly bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and is a P-glycoprotein substrate limiting its brain distribution. We assess imatinib's protein binding interaction with primaquine, which also binds to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and its metabolic interaction with ketoconazole, which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, on its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Male ICR mice, 9-12 weeks old were given imatinib PO (50 mg/kg) alone or co-administered with primaquine (12.5 mg/kg), ketoconazole (50 mg/kg) or both, and imatinib concentration in the plasma, kidney, liver and brain was measured at prescheduled time points by HPLC. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. Primaquine increased 1.6-fold plasma AUC(0)--> infinity, C(Max) decreased 24%, T(Max) halved and t(1/2) and mean residence time were longer. Ketoconazole increased plasma AUC(0)-->infinity 64% and doubled the C(Max), but this dose did not affect t(1/2) or mean residence time. When ketoconazole and primaquine were co-administered, imatinib AUC(0)-->infinity and C(Max) increased 32 and 35%, respectively. Ketoconazole did not change imatinib's distribution efficiency in the liver and kidney, primaquine increased it two-fold and it was larger when both the drugs were co-administered with imatinib. Ketoconazole did not change brain penetration but primaquine increased it approximately three-fold. Ketoconazole and primaquine affect imatinib clearance, bioavailability and distribution pattern, which could improve the treatment of renal and brain tumors, but also increase toxicity.

However, scant information is available from middle-income and developing countries. The authors analyzed and compared patterns in childhood cancer mortality in 24 developed and middle-income countries in America, Asia, and Oceania between 1970 and 2007. METHODS: Childhood age-standardized annual mortality rates were derived from the World Health Organization (WHO) database for all neoplasms, bone and kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and leukemias. RESULTS: Since 1970, rates for all childhood cancers dropped from approximately 8 per 100,000 boys to 3 per 100,000 boys and from 6 per 100,000 girls to 2 per 100,000 girls in North America and Japan. Latin American countries registered rates of approximately 5 per 100,000 boys and 4 per 100,000 girls for 2005 through 2007, similar to the rates registered in more developed areas in the early 1980s. Similar patterns were observed for leukemias, for which the mortality rates were 0.81 per 100,000 boys and 0.55 per 100,000 girls in North America, 0.86 per 100,000 boys and 0.68 per 100,000 girls in Japan, and 1.98 per 100,000 boys and 1.65 per 100,000 girls in Latin America for 2005 through 2007. Bone cancer rates for 2005 through 2007 were approximately 2-fold higher in Argentina than in the United States. During the same period, Mexico registered the highest rate for kidney cancer and Colombia registered the highest rate for NHL, whereas the lowest rates were registered by Japan for kidney and by Japan and the United States for NHL. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the adoption of current integrated treatment protocols in Latin American and other lower- and middle-income countries worldwide would avoid a substantial proportion of childhood cancer deaths.","['Chatenoud, Liliane', 'Bertuccio, Paola', 'Bosetti, Cristina', 'Levi, Fabio', 'Negri, Eva', 'La Vecchia, Carlo']","['Chatenoud L', 'Bertuccio P', 'Bosetti C', 'Levi F', 'Negri E', 'La Vecchia C']","['Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacology Research, Milan, Italy. liliane.chatenoud@marionegri.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Oceania']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25406 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Nov 1;116(21):5063-74. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25406.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some cooperative groups administer a second cycle of similar induction therapy on Day 14 if there is residual leukemia. It is a common perception that the presence of residual leukemia at that point predicts a worse prognosis irrespective of the therapy received. The objective of this study was to determine whether patients who required a second cycle of induction (given on or about Day 14) to achieve complete remission (CR) had a worse prognosis than patients who achieved CR after only 1 cycle, because a worse prognosis may alter postremission therapy. METHODS: Patients who were enrolled on 6 consecutive studies for AML that were conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) between 1983 to 1993 received induction therapy. If residual leukemia was present in the bone marrow on the Day 14 after the start of induction, then patients were to receive a second cycle of identical induction therapy. All patients who achieved CR after 1 or 2 cycles received the identical postremission therapy. RESULTS: In each of the 6 ECOG studies, the long-term outcome was similar for patients who required 1 or 2 cycles of induction therapy to achieve CR, and their outcome was independent of other prognostic variables, such as age or karyotype. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of residual leukemia in bone marrow 10 to 14 days after induction therapy did not predict a worse prognosis if patients received second, similar cycle of induction therapy and achieved CR.","['Rowe, Jacob M', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Cassileth, Peter A', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Rowe JM', 'Kim HT', 'Cassileth PA', 'Lazarus HM', 'Litzow MR', 'Wiernik PH', 'Tallman MS']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center and Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. rowe@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25263 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Nov 1;116(21):5012-21. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25263.,,,"['U10 CA013650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA014958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA017145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA066636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA014548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA023318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3566633,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],['Cancer. 2010 Nov 1;116(21):4896-901.

Physicians need to determine whether palliation, ""something"" beyond palliation, intensive therapy, or an investigational therapy is the most appropriate treatment option. This requires understanding of the biology and risk profile of the AML, clinical judgment in evaluating the functional status of the patient, communication skills in understanding the patient's wishes and social background, and medical expertise in available therapies. The physician has to accurately inform the patient about (a) the unique biological considerations of his leukemia and his prognosis; (b) the risks and benefits of all available treatment options; (c) novel therapeutic approaches and how the patient can get access to these treatments.

Increasing evidence suggests that CEBPA exerts its effects, in parts, by regulating specific microRNAs (miRNAs), as previously shown for miR-223. The aim of this study was to investigate the genome-wide pattern of miRNAs regulated by CEBPA in myeloid cells. METHODS: In Kasumi-1 cells, conditionally expressing CEBPA, we assessed the expression of 470 human miRNAs by microarray analysis. We further investigated the microarray results by qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: In all, 18 miRNAs were more than two-fold suppressed or induced after CEBPA restoration. Among these 18 miRNAs, we focused on CEBPA-mediated regulation of the tumour-suppressive miR-29b. We observed that miR-29b is suppressed in AML patients with impaired CEBPA function or loss of chromosome 7q. We found that CEBPA selectively regulates miR-29b expression on its miR-29a/b1 locus on chromosome 7q32.3, whereas miR-29b2/c on chromosome 1q32.2 is not affected. CONCLUSION: This study reports the activation of the tumour-suppressive miR-29b by the haematopoietic key transcription factor CEBPA. Our data provide a rationale for miR-29b suppression in AML patients with loss of chromosome 7q or CEBPA deficiency.","['Eyholzer, M', 'Schmid, S', 'Wilkens, L', 'Mueller, B U', 'Pabst, T']","['Eyholzer M', 'Schmid S', 'Wilkens L', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*pharmacology']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['6605751 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605751 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Jul 13;103(2):275-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605751.,,,,PMC2906742,,['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(2):65-70.

This study investigated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling in spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL cells and whether manipulating ER stress increases their apoptosis. Results show that a novel ER stress-triggered caspase cascade, initiated by caspase-4 and involving caspase-8 and -3, plays an important role in spontaneous B-CLL cell apoptosis. ER stress-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells also involves CHOP/GADD153 up-regulation, increased JNK1/2 phosphorylation, and caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bap31 to Bap20, known to propagate apoptotic signals from ER to mitochondria. In ex vivo B-CLL cells, some apoptotic events associated with mitochondrial pathway also occur, including mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. However, pharmacologic inhibition studies show that caspase-9 plays a minor role in B-CLL cell apoptosis. ER stress also triggers survival signals in B-CLL cells by increasing BiP/GRP78 expression. Manipulating ER signaling by siRNA down-regulation of BiP/GRP78 or treating B-CLL cells with 2 well-known ER stress-inducers, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, increases their apoptosis. Overall, our findings show that ER triggers an essential pathway for B-CLL cell apoptosis and suggest that genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of ER signaling could represent an important therapeutic strategy.","['Rosati, Emanuela', 'Sabatini, Rita', 'Rampino, Giuliana', 'De Falco, Filomena', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Fettucciari, Katia', 'Bartoli, Andrea', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco']","['Rosati E', 'Sabatini R', 'Rampino G', 'De Falco F', 'Di Ianni M', 'Falzetti F', 'Fettucciari K', 'Bartoli A', 'Screpanti I', 'Marconi P']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, General Pathology and Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. erosati@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100713,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCAP31 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31257-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-275628 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 14;116(15):2713-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-275628.

Analysis of mouse mutants for Pbx and Emx2 genes has suggested their potential roles in girdle development. In this study, by generating compound mutant mice, we examined the genetic control of scapula development by Pbx genes and their functional relationship with Emx2. Analyses of Pbx and Pbx1;Emx2 compound mutants revealed that Pbx genes share overlapping functions in shoulder development and that Pbx1 genetically interacts with Emx2 in this process. Here, we provide a biochemical basis for Pbx1;Emx2 genetic interaction by showing that Pbx1 and Emx2 can bind specific DNA sequences as heterodimers. Moreover, the expression of genes crucial for scapula development is altered in these mutants, indicating that Pbx genes act upstream of essential pathways for scapula formation. In particular, expression of Alx1, an effector of scapula blade patterning, is absent in all compound mutants. We demonstrate that Pbx1 and Emx2 bind in vivo to a conserved sequence upstream of Alx1 and cooperatively activate its transcription via this potential regulatory element. Our results establish an essential role for Pbx1 in genetic interactions with its family members and with Emx2 and delineate novel regulatory networks in shoulder girdle development.","['Capellini, Terence D', 'Vaccari, Giulia', 'Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Fantini, Sebastian', 'He, Mu', 'Pellegrini, Massimo', 'Quintana, Laura', 'Di Giacomo, Giuseppina', 'Sharpe, James', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Zappavigna, Vincenzo']","['Capellini TD', 'Vaccari G', 'Ferretti E', 'Fantini S', 'He M', 'Pellegrini M', 'Quintana L', 'Di Giacomo G', 'Sharpe J', 'Selleri L', 'Zappavigna V']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Alx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (empty spiracles homeobox proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Scapula/*embryology/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Shoulder/embryology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['137/15/2559 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.048819 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2010 Aug 1;137(15):2559-69. doi: 10.1242/dev.048819.,,,"['MC_U127574434/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R21 DE018031/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', '3R21DE018031-02S1/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD061403/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD043997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'GGP05181/TI_/Telethon/Italy', '1R01HD061403-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '2R01HD043997-06/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2927673,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: all patients with AL admitted to the 17 departments managing AL in Paris area from 2005 to 2007 were prospectively included. Clinical data, therapeutic decisions, and enrollment in trials were recorded. Reasons that prevented accrual were identified. RESULTS: a total of 1066 admissions with AL (85% of adults) were recorded, and 34 trials were open. In adults, the rate of inclusion in a trial was 25% [95% confidence interval (CI) 21% to 28%] for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 23% (95% CI 17% to 29%) for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). In children, the rate of inclusion was 58% (95% CI 41% to 73%) for AML and 64% (95% CI 55% to 72%) for ALL. The rate of inclusion varied across centers, with a significant increase when they were involved in clinical research. Patients included in trials differed significantly from those not included according to age, primary/secondary AL, leukemia type, results of cytogenetic analyses, and stage of disease. CONCLUSIONS: the rate of inclusion is higher than in oncology. This difference may be explained by management in specialized centers often involved in clinical research.","['Dechartres, A', 'Chevret, S', 'Lambert, J', 'Calvo, F', 'Levy, V']","['Dechartres A', 'Chevret S', 'Lambert J', 'Calvo F', 'Levy V']","['Biostatistic Department.', 'Biostatistic Department; INSERM U717.', 'Biostatistic Department; INSERM U717.', 'INSERM CIC 9504, Saint Louis Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris), Paris.', 'INSERM U717; INSERM CIC 9504, Saint Louis Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris), Paris; Hematology and Oncology Department, Avicenne Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris), Bobigny, France.

We report the case of a 52-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a keloid scar to his left earlobe that developed following a piercing. Despite multiple intralesional steroidal injections, five intralesional excisions and a course of superficial radiotherapy the keloid scar remained over nine years later. For 15 years the patient had also suffered chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with no nodal disease or systemic involvement. However, histological analysis of the final surgical excision specimen showed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia infiltration of the keloid scar. Further surgical excision seemed unwise considering the recalcitrance of the keloid scar. Additionally, no systemic chemotherapy treatment options were feasible. Electrochemotherapy was performed under local anaesthesia with the aim of eradicating the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia deposit within the keloid lesion. Four sessions of electrochemotherapy using bleomycin were deployed over 11 months. A deep core biopsy of the treated keloid performed three months following the last electrochemotherapy session showed no evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Serendipitously, following the initial electrochemotherapy treatment no further growth of the keloid scar was observed. Furthermore, subsequent electrochemotherapy led to a substantial reduction in size of the keloid sustained for 14 months at last follow-up. This report highlights the exciting potential of electrochemotherapy and bleomycin in the treatment of recalcitrant scars. Larger, well-designed clinical and in-vitro studies are required to further elucidate the exact role, mechanism and cost-effectiveness of electrochemotherapy in this area.","['Sainsbury, D C G', 'Allison, K P', 'Muir, T']","['Sainsbury DC', 'Allison KP', 'Muir T']","['Department of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK. davidsainsbury@mac.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100602,Netherlands,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",101264239,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/*therapeutic use', 'Ear Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', '*Ear, External', 'Electrochemotherapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Keloid/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/10/15 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1748-6815(10)00300-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bjps.2010.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg. 2010 Oct;63(10):e733-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.05.008.

MCS-5A effectively induces HL-60 cell cycle arrest at the G(1) and G(2)/M phases through direct inhibition of CDK1 and 4 activity. In addition, elevated expression of p16(INK4a) and a reduction in the level of hyperphosphorylated pRb showed that 3 1V MCS-5A also induces p16(INK4a)-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G(1) phase. Furthermore, apoptotic induction in MCS-5A-treated HL-60 cells is associated with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which, in turn, results in the activation of procaspase-8, -9 and -3, and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

METHODS: Twelve patients who were refractory to fludarabine-based treatment were treated with 2-6 cycles of HDMP (1g/m(2) for 5days). RESULTS: Ten patients (83.3%) responded to treatment and three (25.0%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Two (16.7%) of which had no evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment. Patients with leukaemia cells that have high expression of ZAP-70 or CD38, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV), mutated p53 or adverse cytogenetic features achieved response to treatment at rates that appeared similar to those achieved by patients who did not have such disease characteristics.

This NF-kappaB signaling is mainly induced by the protein kinase IKK beta. Early in this signaling pathway, IKK beta is phosphorylated for activation by several factors, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and the Tax oncoprotein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In cells expressing Tax protein, IKK beta is persistently phosphorylated, which chronically activates NF-kappaB signaling. But the active IKK beta is conjugated with a monoubiquitin by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ro52, and the IKK beta-induced NF-kappaB signaling is downregulated. However, the mechanism of the downregulation has been unknown. Here, we show that Ro52-mediated monoubiquitination is involved in the subcellular translocation of active IKK beta to autophagosomes. Furthermore, using reporter assays, we show that Ro52 suppresses IKK beta-induced NF-kappaB signaling and that this suppression is blocked by an autophagy inhibitor. These results suggest that Ro52-mediated monoubiquitination plays a critical role in the downregulation of active IKK beta through autophagy.","['Niida, Motoko', 'Tanaka, Makoto', 'Kamitani, Tetsu']","['Niida M', 'Tanaka M', 'Kamitani T']","['Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas M.

The outcome of patients with MF-BP is grave with a median survival of only 2.7 months. MF-BP is largely refractory to conventional chemotherapy and intensive induction therapy fails to have a significant impact with a median survival of 3.9 months. Eleven consecutive patients were treated at our institution with MF-BP over a 2-year period. Eligible patients with an available donor received an allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) and those that were not eligible or without a donor were treated with Decitabine (DEC). The median time for follow up for the entire group was 9 months (range 5-21 month). At 9 months (range 5-45 months), 67% of the patients treated with DEC were alive and at 20 months (range 9-23 months), 53% of patients treated with ASCT remain alive. Reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-ASCT) is a viable option that offers the potential for prolonged survival and the possibility of cure for patients with MF-BP.

The mechanisms whereby melatonin regulates the apoptotic program remain only partially understood. Anti-/pro-apoptotic effects of exogenous melatonin on various stimuli-mediated apoptosis were investigated in this report. We investigated the combined effect of melatonin and death receptor-mediated ligands (TNF-alpha, TRAIL, and anti-Fas antibody) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing agents (thapsigargin, brefeldin A, and tunicamycin) on apoptosis of cancer cells. Death receptor- or ER stress-induced apoptosis was not significantly influenced by melatonin treatment. However, pretreatment with melatonin significantly inhibited DNA damage-induced apoptosis and glutathione (GSH) depletion, suggesting the reactive oxygen species mediate oxaliplatin/etoposide-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, we also found the involvement of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) downregulation in oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis; thus, pretreatment with melatonin inhibited Mcl-1 downregulation, and ectopic expression of Mcl-1 attenuated oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the results demonstrate that melatonin attenuates oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells by inhibition of GSH depletion and Mcl-1 downregulation.","['Um, Hee Jung', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Um HJ', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100707,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*toxicity', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2010/07/16 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['JPI793 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00793.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2010 Oct;49(3):283-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00793.x.

Protein tyrosine kinase abnormalities, including translocations or mutations involving ABL1, JAK2, MPL, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1, have been used as the basis for classifying myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Two new entities - refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia and refractory cytopenia of childhood have been added to the group of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 'refractory anemia with excess blasts-1' has been redefined to emphasize the prognostic significance of increased blasts in the peripheral blood. A list of cytogenetic abnormalities has been introduced as presumptive evidence of MDS in cases with refractory cytopenia but without morphologic evidence of dysplasia. The subgroup 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with recurrent genetic abnormalities' has been expanded to include more molecular genetic aberrations. The entity 'AML with multilineage dysplasia' specified in the 2001 WHO classification has been renamed 'AML with myelodysplasia-related changes' to include not only cases with significant multilineage dysplasia but also patients with a history of MDS or myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormalities. The term 'therapy-related myeloid neoplasms' is used to cover the spectrum of disorders previously known as t-AML, t-MDS, or t-MDS/MPN occurring as complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In this review, we summarize many of these important changes and discuss some of the diagnostic challenges that remain.","['Yin, C C', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Bueso-Ramos, C E']","['Yin CC', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['The Department of Hematopathology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. cyin@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100707,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/classification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/12/21 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1246 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01246.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Oct;32(5):461-76. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01246.x.

METHODS: Thirty Kunming mice were randomly divided into control, CE of ""Shimen"" (CV 5, CE-CV 5) and medication groups (n = 10/group). For mice of CE-CV 5 group, a piece of catgut was embedded into the subcutaneous tissue of ""Shimen"" (CV 5) on the day when the vagina-discharged epistom was found (pregnancy day 1, Pd 1). On Pd 4, mifepristone (0.1 mL, diluted in propylene glycol) was subcutaneously injected into CV 5 in rats of medication group. The expression of endometrial pinopodes (sampled on Pd 5) was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The immunoactivity of LIF of the endometrium was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the mean optical density (OD) values of LIF in CE-CV 5 and medication groups decreased significantly (P < 0.05), suggesting an downregulation of the endometrial LIF expression. No significant difference was found between CE-CV 5 and medication group in LIF expression (P > 0.05). Electronic microscopic observation showed (1) abundant mature pinopodes on the endometrial surface, with a large number of well-stacked ecphyma in control group; (2) fewer pinopodes and well-arranged smooth epithelial cells on the endometrial surface in catgut embedding group; and (3) no pinopodes found in the endometrium of medication group. CONCLUSION: Catgut embedding at ""Shimen"" (CV 5) can suppress the establishment of the mouse endometrial receptivity, which is possibly related to its effect in inhibiting the expression of endometrial pinopodes and LIF.","['Zhang, Ou', 'Li, Hui', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zheng, Li-yan']","['Zhang O', 'Li H', 'Wang W', 'Zheng LY']","['Institute of Acu-moxibustion and Massage, Liaoning University of Chinese Medicine, Shenyang 110032, China. zhangouln@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhen Ci Yan Jiu,Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research,8507710,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Catgut', 'Endometrium/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Pregnancy', 'Random Allocation']",2010/07/16 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2010/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhen Ci Yan Jiu. 2010 Apr;35(2):108-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embelin resulted in loss of cell viability and inhibition of proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was largely attributed to apoptosis. Embelin caused depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) was down-regulated by embelin. Embelin induced activation of caspase-9 and embelin-induced apoptosis was prevented by caspase inhibitors. Taken together, these findings suggest that embelin results in human leukemia cells apoptosis through caspase-dependent mechanisms involving down-regulation of XIAP.","['Hu, Rong', 'Zhu, Ke', 'Li, Yingchun', 'Yao, Kun', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Wang, Huihan', 'Yang, Wei', 'Liu, Zhuogang']","['Hu R', 'Zhu K', 'Li Y', 'Yao K', 'Zhang R', 'Wang H', 'Yang W', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, 110004, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100713,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SHC6U8F5ER (embelin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9601-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28(4):1584-8. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9601-5.

In the present study, we compared the efficacy and toxicity of FC administered through oral and intravenous route in 65 untreated patients affected by advanced CLL. No statistical differences were noticed between the two routes of administration in terms of OR, PFS, time to re-treatment (TTR) and overall survival (OS) of analysed patients. We also assessed the influence on the clinical outcome of the mutation status of the immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IgVH) gene, of the cytogenetic abnormalities and of the expression of ZAP70 and CD38 in patients' primary samples. Among the 58 evaluable patients, 31 (53%) achieved a CR and 18 (31%) a partial response. The median PFS was 35 months, median TTR was 42 months and median OS was not reached after 45 months (range, 1-161). A significantly lower OR rate was noticed in patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (del 17p, del 11q). In this study, high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and unmutated IgVH genes were independent predictors of TTR. These results underline the importance of biological stratifications in front-line treatment of CLL patients. We confirm that FC is an effective regimen with mild toxicities; it could be recommended for patients with low-risk biological parameters who represent, in our experience, about 30% of the total.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'De Padua, Laura', 'Tarnani, Michela', 'Piccirillo, Nicola', 'Falcucci, Paolo', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Marietti, Sara', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Zini, Gina', ""Sora', Federica"", 'Sica, Simona', 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Laurenti L', 'De Padua L', 'Tarnani M', 'Piccirillo N', 'Falcucci P', ""D'Arena G"", 'Innocenti I', 'Marietti S', 'Efremov DG', 'Chiusolo P', 'Zini G', ""Sora' F"", 'Sica S', 'Leone G']","[""Istituto di Ematologia, Policlinico A Gemelli, Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy. l.laurenti@rm.unicatt.it""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20100713,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2010/07/14 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1025-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Jan;90(1):59-65. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1025-y.

In this paper, assays on biocompatibility of materials used for Lab-on-a-chip fabrication has been carried out using two tumor cell lines growing in suspension, the human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line, able to undergo erythroid differentiation when cultured with chemical inducers, and the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), extensively used for screening of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).

However, when experiments were performed with short incubation time (1 h), only Aramid fiber filled epoxy uncured was cytotoxic. Variation of the results concerning the other materials was appreciable when the experiments performed on two cell lines were compared together.

In this study, we investigated the role of the CK2alpha intronless gene (CSNK2A1P, a presumed CK2alpha pseudogene) in the pathogenesis of human cancers. We found evidence of amplification and over-expression of the CSNK2A1P gene in non-small cell lung cancer and leukemia cell lines and 25% of the lung cancer tissues studied. The mRNA expression levels correlated with the copy numbers of the CSNK2A1P gene. We also identified a novel polymorphic variant (398T/C, I133T) of the CSNK2A1P gene and showed that the 398T allele is selectively amplified over the 398C allele in 101 non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples compared to those in 48 normal controls (p = 0.013<0.05). We show for the first time CSNK2A1P protein expression in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell lines. Both alleles are transforming in these cell lines, and the 398T allele appears to be more transforming than the 398C allele. Moreover, the 398T allele degrades PML tumor suppressor protein more efficiently than the 398C allele and shows a relatively stronger binding to PML. Knockdown of the CSNK2A1P gene expression with specific siRNA increased the PML protein level in lung cancer cells. We report, for the first time, that the CSNK2A1P gene is a functional proto-oncogene in human cancers and its functional polymorphism appears to degrade PML differentially in cancer cells. These results are consistent with an important role for the 398T allele of the CSNK2A1P in human lung cancer susceptibility.","['Hung, Ming-Szu', 'Lin, Yu-Ching', 'Mao, Jian-Hua', 'Kim, Il-Jin', 'Xu, Zhidong', 'Yang, Cheng-Ta', 'Jablons, David M', 'You, Liang']","['Hung MS', 'Lin YC', 'Mao JH', 'Kim IJ', 'Xu Z', 'Yang CT', 'Jablons DM', 'You L']","['Thoracic Oncology Laboratory, Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100702,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Casein Kinase II/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0011418 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jul 2;5(7):e11418. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011418.,,,['093708-01A3/PHS HHS/United States'],PMC2896393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, HSCT when a patient is not in complete remission (CR) is of uncertain benefit. We hypothesized that pretransplantation variables may define subgroups that have a better prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 2,255 patients who underwent transplantation for acute leukemia in relapse or with primary induction failure after myeloablative conditioning regimen between 1995 and 2004 were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. The median follow-up of survivors was 61 months. We performed multivariate analysis of pretransplantation variables and developed a predictive scoring system for survival. RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 19% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 16% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For AML, five adverse pretransplantation variables significantly influenced survival: first CR duration less than 6 months, circulating blasts, donor other than HLA-identical sibling, Karnofsky or Lansky score less than 90, and poor-risk cytogenetics. For ALL, survival was worse with the following: first refractory or second or greater relapse, > or = 25% marrow blasts, cytomegalovirus-seropositive donor, and age of 10 years or older. Patients with AML who had a predictive score of 0 had 42% OS at 3 years, whereas OS was 6% for a score > or = 3.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on 684 bone marrow (BM; n = 331) and/or peripheral blood (PB; n = 353) samples (median, 13 samples per patient) from 53 younger adult (16 to 60 years old) patients with AML treated in prospective German-Austrian AML Study Group treatment trials. Samples were obtained at diagnosis (BM, n = 45; PB, n = 48), during treatment course (BM, n = 153; PB, n = 122), and at follow-up (BM, n = 133; PB, n = 183). To evaluate the applicability of PB for MRD detection, 198 paired BM and PB samples obtained at identical time points were analyzed. RESULTS: The following three clinically relevant checkpoints were identified during consolidation and early follow-up that predicted relapse: achievement of PCR negativity in at least one BM sample during consolidation therapy (2-year relapse-free survival [RFS], 79% v 54% for PCR positivity; P = .035); achievement of PCR negativity in at least two BM or PB samples during consolidation therapy and early follow-up (< or = 3 months; 2-year RFS, P = .001; overall survival, P = .01); and conversion from PCR negativity to PCR positivity with copy ratios of more than 10 after consolidation therapy. Analysis of paired BM and PB samples revealed BM samples to be more sensitive during the course of therapy, whereas for follow-up, PB samples were equally informative. CONCLUSION: We defined clinically relevant MRD checkpoints that allow for the identification of patients with CBFB-MYH11-positive AML who are at high risk of relapse. Monitoring of CBFB-MYH11 transcript levels should be incorporated into future clinical trials to guide therapeutic decisions.","['Corbacioglu, Andrea', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Eiwen, Karina', 'Du, Juan', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Reimer, Peter', 'Rummel, Mathias', 'Derigs, Hans-Gunter', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Corbacioglu A', 'Scholl C', 'Schlenk RF', 'Eiwen K', 'Du J', 'Bullinger L', 'Frohling S', 'Reimer P', 'Rummel M', 'Derigs HG', 'Nachbaur D', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100712,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (MYH11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.6468 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.6468 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 10;28(23):3724-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.6468.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1996 to 2008, 1,025 patients with APL were enrolled onto three sequential trials (LPA96, LPA99, and LPA2005) of the Programa Espanol para el Tratamiento de Enfermedades Hematologicas and received induction and consolidation therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: Seventeen of 918 patients who achieved CR developed t-MN (10 with < 20% and seven with > or = 20% of bone marrow blasts) after a median of 43 months from CR. Partial and complete deletions of chromosomes 5 and 7 (nine patients) and 11q23 rearrangements (three patients) were the most common cytogenetic abnormalities. Overall, the 6-year cumulative incidence of t-MN was 2.2%, whereas in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, the 6-year incidence was 5.2%, 2.1%, and 0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified age more than 35 years and lower relapse risk score as independent prognostic factors for t-MN. The median overall survival time after t-MN was 10 months. CONCLUSION: t-MN is a relatively infrequent, long-term, and severe complication after first-line treatment for APL with ATRA and anthracycline-based regimens. Therapeutic strategies to reduce the incidence of t-MN are warranted.","['Montesinos, Pau', 'Gonzalez, Jose D', 'Gonzalez, Jose', 'Rayon, Chelo', 'de Lisa, Elena', 'Amigo, Maria L', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Penarrubia, Maria J', 'Perez-Encinas, Manuel', 'Bergua, Juan', 'Deben, Guillermo', 'Sayas, Maria J', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Ribera, Josep M', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Milone, Gustavo', 'Rivas, Concha', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Sanz, Miguel']","['Montesinos P', 'Gonzalez JD', 'Gonzalez J', 'Rayon C', 'de Lisa E', 'Amigo ML', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Penarrubia MJ', 'Perez-Encinas M', 'Bergua J', 'Deben G', 'Sayas MJ', 'de la Serna J', 'Ribera JM', 'Bueno J', 'Milone G', 'Rivas C', 'Brunet S', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sanz M']","['Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100712,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.29.2268 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.29.2268 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 20;28(24):3872-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.29.2268.

The prognosis of both IDH1m and IDH2m in AML remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prevalence and the prognostic impact of R132 IDH1 and R172 IDH2 mutations were evaluated in a cohort of 520 adults with AML homogeneously treated in the French Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) -9801 and -9802 trials. RESULTS: The prevalence of IDH1m and IDH2m was 9.6% and 3.0%, respectively, mostly associated with normal cytogenetics (CN). In patients with CN-AML, IDH1m were associated with NPM1m (P = .008), but exclusive of CEBPAm (P = .03). In contrary, no other mutations were detected in IDH2m patients. In CN-AML patients, IDH1m were found in 19% of favorable genotype ([NPM1m or CEBPAm] without fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3] internal tandem duplication [ITD]) and were associated with a higher risk of relapse (RR) and a shorter overall survival (OS). Favorable genotype in CN-AML could thus be defined by the association of NPM1m or CEBPAm with neither FLT3-ITD nor IDH1m. In IDH2m CN-AML patients, we observed a higher risk of induction failure, a higher RR and a shorter OS. In multivariate analysis, age, WBC count, the four-gene favorable genotype and IDH2m were independently associated with a higher RR and a shorter OS. CONCLUSION: Contrarily to what is reported in gliomas, IDH1m and IDH2m in AML are associated with a poor prognosis. Screening of IDH1m could help to identify high-risk patients within the subset of CN-AML with a favorable genotype.","['Boissel, Nicolas', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Gardin, Claude', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Contentin, Nathalie', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'de Revel, Thierry', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Huchette, Pascal', 'Philippe, Nathalie', 'Geffroy, Sandrine', 'Terre, Christine', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Boissel N', 'Nibourel O', 'Renneville A', 'Gardin C', 'Reman O', 'Contentin N', 'Bordessoule D', 'Pautas C', 'de Revel T', 'Quesnel B', 'Huchette P', 'Philippe N', 'Geffroy S', 'Terre C', 'Thomas X', 'Castaigne S', 'Dombret H', 'Preudhomme C']","['University of Paris 7, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100712,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Previous studies have suggested an association between blood transfusions and NHL. The main objective of this study was to evaluate this relationship with a meta-analysis of observational studies. A literature search was undertaken, looking for case-control and cohort studies evaluating the risk of developing NHL in persons who received allogeneic blood transfusions; 14 studies were included. Outcome was calculated and reported as relative risk (RR). Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochrane Q and I(2) statistics. Dissemination bias was evaluated by funnel plot visualization and trim-and-fill analysis. Quality assessment was performed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Our analysis showed a RR of developing NHL of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.89-1.25; P = .42) and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.15-1.55; P < .01) in case-control and cohort studies, respectively. When pooling all studies, RR was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.07-1.35; P < .01). In subset analysis, RR of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.08-2.56; P = .02). The RR of NHL was elevated in both men and women and in persons receiving transfusions either before or after 1992. Blood transfusions appear to increase the risk of developing NHL; however, the risk of CLL/SLL appears higher than for other NHL subtypes.","['Castillo, Jorge J', 'Dalia, Samir', 'Pascual, Sheila K']","['Castillo JJ', 'Dalia S', 'Pascual SK']","['The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI 02906, USA. jcastillo@lifespan.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20100712,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology', 'Male', 'Risk Assessment']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31216-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-276683 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2897-907. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-276683.

These efforts have focused largely on cyclopamine derivatives or other compounds that mimic cyclopamine action in binding to and antagonizing Smoothened, a membrane transductory component. We report here that arsenicals, in contrast, antagonize the Hh pathway by targeting Gli transcriptional effectors; in the short term, arsenic blocks Hh-induced ciliary accumulation of Gli2, the primary activator of Hh-dependent transcription, and with prolonged incubation arsenic reduces steady-state levels of Gli2. Arsenicals active in Hh pathway antagonism include arsenic trioxide (ATO), a curative agent in clinical use for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); in our studies, ATO inhibited growth of Hh pathway-driven medulloblastoma allografts derived from Ptch+/-p53-/- mice within a range of serum levels comparable to those achieved in treatment of human APL. Arsenic thus could be tested rapidly as a therapeutic agent in malignant diseases associated with Hh pathway activation and could be particularly useful in such diseases that are inherently resistant or have acquired resistance to cyclopamine mimics.","['Kim, Jynho', 'Lee, John J', 'Kim, James', 'Gardner, Dale', 'Beachy, Philip A']","['Kim J', 'Lee JJ', 'Kim J', 'Gardner D', 'Beachy PA']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100712,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Gli2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli2)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology/prevention & control', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sodium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli2']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1006822107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1006822107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jul 27;107(30):13432-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1006822107.

The analyzed undifferentiated cell lines are very similar based on their global gene expression pattern and show 97-99% identity dependent on the analyzed background. Only 621 genes are differentially expressed in cells derived from mouse 129SV-background and 72 genes show differences in expression in cells generated from transgenic Stra8-EGFP/Rosa26-LacZ-background. Both maGSCs and ESCs express the same genes involved in the regulation of pluripotency and even show no differences in the expression level of these genes. When comparing maGSCs with previously published signature genes of other pluripotent cell lines, we found that maGSCs shared a very similar gene expression pattern with embryonic germ cells (EGCs). Also after differentiation of maGSCs and ESCs the transcriptomes of the cell lines are nearly identical which suggests that both cell types differentiate spontaneously in a very similar way.

This neoplasm caricatures metanephric development and is believed to originate from embryonic renal mesenchymal progenitors that lose their ability to undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Therefore, we hypothesized that STAT1 is also activated and functional during metanephric development. Here we have demonstrated that both STAT1 and STAT3 are activated during normal development of the embryonic kidney. Furthermore, activation of STAT1 stimulated the proliferation of metanephric mesenchymal cells, but it prevented MET and tubulogenesis induced by leukemia inhibitory factor, which preferentially activates STAT3. Consistent with its negative regulation of metanephric mesenchymal differentiation, inhibition of STAT1 activation with protein kinase CK2 inhibitor TBB or RNAi-mediated knockdown of STAT1 promoted differentiation of metanephric progenitors and abolished the effect of cytokine-induced STAT1 activation in these cells. Additionally, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits STAT1-mediated transactivation by targeting the STAT1 N-domain also blocked cytokine-induced STAT1-dependent proliferation in metanephric progenitors and promoted LIF-induced MET and tubulogenesis. Finally, the STAT1 peptide inhibitor caused the down regulation of survival/anti-apoptotic factors, Mcl-1 and Hsp-27, and induced apoptosis in renal tumor cells with constitutively active STAT1, indicating that STAT1 is required for these cells to survive. These findings show that both metanephric progenitors and renal tumor cells utilize a STAT1-dependent mechanism for growth or survival.","['Wang, Honghe', 'Yang, Yili', 'Sharma, Nirmala', 'Tarasova, Nadya I', 'Timofeeva, Olga A', 'Winkler-Pickett, Robin T', 'Tanigawa, Shunsuke', 'Perantoni, Alan O']","['Wang H', 'Yang Y', 'Sharma N', 'Tarasova NI', 'Timofeeva OA', 'Winkler-Pickett RT', 'Tanigawa S', 'Perantoni AO']","['Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100717,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Kidney/cytology/*embryology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(10)00177-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.06.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2010 Nov;22(11):1717-26. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.06.012.

It forms a solid malignant tumor consisting of myelocytes or granulocytes and is typically located in bone while occurrence in other parts of the body is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 40-year-old male patient who had jaundice, highly elevated bilirubin, and a mass highly suspicious of pancreatic head carcinoma. We performed surgery and the pathology and immunohistochemistry suggested GS; however the blood test and the bone marrow infiltration showed no evidence of AML. In our review of the published reports of GS, we only found six reports of the GS in the pancreas, and we suggested that immunohistochemical staining should be used to accurately differentiate GS from other pancreatic cancer and other types of leukemia.

We investigated the mechanism of FK228-induced apoptosis in the human leukemia cell line HL-60 and its hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-resistant sub-clone, HP100, and the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2. Cytotoxicity and DNA ladder formation induced by FK228 could be detected in HL-60 cells after a 24-h incubation, whereas they could not be detected in HP100 cells. Trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor, induced DNA ladder formation in both HL-60 and HP100 cells. In contrast, FK228 inhibited HDAC activity in both HL-60 and HP100 cells to a similar extent. These findings suggest that FK228-induced apoptosis involves H(2)O(2)-mediated pathways and that TSA-induced apoptosis does not. Flow cytometry revealed H(2)O(2) formation and a change in mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) in FK228-treated cells. FK228 also induced apoptosis in Caco-2 cells, which was prevented by N-acetyl-cysteine, suggesting that reactive oxygen species participate in apoptosis in various types of tumor cells. Interestingly, in a cell-free system, FK228 generated superoxide (O(2)(-)) in the presence of glutathione, suggesting that H(2)O(2) is derived from dismutation of O(2)(-) produced through redox-cycle of FK228. Therefore, in addition to HDAC inhibition, H(2)O(2) generated from FK228 may participate in its apoptotic effect.","['Mizutani, Hideki', 'Hiraku, Yusuke', 'Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Murata, Mariko', 'Ikemura, Kenji', 'Iwamoto, Takuya', 'Kagawa, Yoshiyuki', 'Okuda, Masahiro', 'Kawanishi, Shosuke']","['Mizutani H', 'Hiraku Y', 'Tada-Oikawa S', 'Murata M', 'Ikemura K', 'Iwamoto T', 'Kagawa Y', 'Okuda M', 'Kawanishi S']","['College of Pharmacy, Kinjo Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100707,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1645 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01645.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Oct;101(10):2214-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01645.x.

DMD patients exhibit progressive muscle weakness and atrophy followed by exhaustion of muscular regenerative capacity, fibrosis, and eventually disruption of the muscle tissue architecture. In-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene lead to expression of a partially functional protein, resulting in the milder BMD. No effective therapies are available at present. Cell-based therapies have been attempted in an effort to promote muscle regeneration, with the hope that the host cells would repopulate the muscle and improve muscle function and pathology. Injection of adult myoblasts has led to the development of new muscle fibers, but several limitations have been identified, such as poor cell survival and limited migratory ability. As an alternative to myoblasts, stem cells were considered preferable for therapeutic applications because of their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation potential. In recent years, encouraging results have been obtained with adult stem cells to treat human diseases such as leukemia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and muscular dystrophies. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be derived from mammalian embryos in the blastocyst stage, and because they can differentiate into a wide range of specialized cells, they hold potential for use in treating almost all human diseases. Several ongoing studies focus on this possibility, evaluating differentiation of specific cell lines from human ESCs (hESCs) as well as the potential tumorigenicity of hESCs. The most important limitation with using hESCs is that it requires destruction of human blastocysts or embryos. Conversely, adult stem cells have been identified in various tissues, where they serve to maintain, generate, and replace terminally differentiated cells within their specific tissue as the need arises for cell turnover or from tissue injury. Moreover, these cells can participate in regeneration of more than just their specific tissue type. Here we describe multiple types of muscle- and fetal-derived myogenic stem cells, their characterization, and their possible use in treating muscular dystrophies such as DMD and BMD. We also emphasize that the most promising possibility for the management and therapy of DMD and BMD is a combination of different approaches, such as gene and stem cell therapy.","['Meregalli, Mirella', 'Farini, Andrea', 'Parolini, Daniele', 'Maciotta, Simona', 'Torrente, Yvan']","['Meregalli M', 'Farini A', 'Parolini D', 'Maciotta S', 'Torrente Y']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Dipartimento di Scienze Neurologiche, Centro Dino Ferrari, Universita di Milano, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,,IM,"['Adult', 'Adult Stem Cells/cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology/physiology', 'Muscular Dystrophies/*therapy', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Regeneration', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/trends']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['3 [pii]', '10.2165/11534300-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,BioDrugs. 2010 Aug 1;24(4):237-47. doi: 10.2165/11534300-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, the generation and evaluation of virtual electron microscopic slides is discussed. A T-lymphoblastic cell was used as an example. Electron microscopic pictures were taken at two magnifications (25,000 and 50,000), processed in an analogue or digital way and stitched to reconstruct the image of the total cell. This image is viewed with a webviewer equipped with pan and zoom functions. The possibility of distinguishing the trilaminar structure of cellular membranes was the requisite. Virtual images obtained at an original magnification of 25,000, scanned at a resolution of 800 ppi could compete with pictures developed directly from negatives obtained by electron microscopy.

In 2003, OSHA denied a union petition to promulgate a standard for MWF. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a union lawsuit to compel OSHA to regulate MWF. OSHA relied exclusively on the 1999 Metal Working Fluids Standards Advisory Committee report, therefore, only evidence available before 1999 was quoted supporting the denial. This review was conducted to identify studies published since 1998. METHODS: Electronic reference sources were queried for the terms for metalworking fluids, machining fluids, cutting fluids, cutting oils, coolants, machining, and machinist. All items returned were reviewed for relevance to MWF regulation. RESULTS: The review noted 227 reports in the peer reviewed literature directly relevant to regulation of MWF exposures. Of these, 26 addressed cancer; 58 respiratory effects; 32 skin effects or absorption; 45 microbial contaminants; and 76 exposure measurements and controls.

The question of whether childhood leukemia has a tendency for clustering or forms clusters has been studied for several decades. The environmental risk factor discussed most often is infection, which might result in spatial clustering and space-time clusters. The German Childhood Cancer Registry provided data on 11,946 children with leukemia diagnosed during 1987-2007, as classified in the International Classification for Childhood Cancer (third edition), aggregated by municipality. We used the Potthoff-Whittinghill model to test for a general trend for clustering and the spatial scan statistic to search for localized clusters. No evidence of global clustering was found, neither for the whole study population nor in sub-groups by age, period or population density, or for different types of leukemia. A similar result was found for localized clusters. The analysis shows no evidence of a tendency to clustering, however, aggregation of data at the municipality level might have diluted small localized clusters. The results of this study do not provide support for the hypothesis of an infectious or a spatial environmental etiology of childhood leukemia.","['Schmiedel, Sven', 'Blettner, Maria', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Schmiedel S', 'Blettner M', 'Kaatsch P', 'Schuz J']","['Institute for Cancer Epidemiology, Copenhagen, Denmark. sven@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100711,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Space-Time Clustering']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10654-010-9488-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2010 Sep;25(9):627-33. doi: 10.1007/s10654-010-9488-7.

P-gp recognizes a wide range of xenobiotics, is pivotal in mediating cancer drug resistance, and plays an important role in limiting drug penetration across the blood-brain barrier. MDR1 genetic variation can lead to changes in P-gp function and may have implications on drug pharmacokinetics. We have identified a novel MDR1 (GT1292-3TG) (Cys431Leu) genetic variation through systematic profiling of subjects with leukemia. The cellular and transport function of this variation was investigated with recombinant human embryonic kidney cells expressing MDR1. Compared with the wild type, MDR1 (GT1292-3TG) recombinant cells exhibited a lower drug resistance phenotype for a panel of chemotherapeutic agents. When compared with wild type, MDR1 (GT1292-3TG) recombinant cells exposed exhibited a 75% decrease in IC(5)(0) for doxorubicin (162.6 +/- 17.4 to 37.9 +/- 2.6 nM) and a 50% decrease in IC(50) for paclitaxel (155.7 +/- 27.5 to 87.7 +/- 9.2 nM), vinblastine (128.0 +/- 15.9 to 65.9 +/- 5.1 nM), and vincristine (593.7 +/- 61.8 to 307.3 +/- 17.0 nM). The effects of the Cys431Leu variation, due to MDR1 (GT1292-3TG) nucleotide transition, on P-gp-dependent intracellular substrate accumulation appeared to be substrate dependent where doxorubicin, vinblastine, and paclitaxel exhibit an increased accumulation (p < 0.05), while verapamil and Hoechst33342 exhibit a decreased intracellular concentration compared with wild type (p < 0.05). Collectively, these data suggest MDR1 (GT1292-3TG) variation of P-gp may reduce drug resistance and that subjects with this genotype undergoing chemotherapy with drugs that are transported by P-gp could potentially be more responsive to therapy than those with MDR1 wild-type genotype.","['Crouthamel, Matthew H', 'Wu, Daniel', 'Yang, Ziping', 'Ho, Rodney J Y']","['Crouthamel MH', 'Wu D', 'Yang Z', 'Ho RJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195-7610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20100710,United States,AAPS J,The AAPS journal,101223209,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine/*chemistry', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2011/04/06 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1208/s12248-010-9216-y [doi]'],ppublish,AAPS J. 2010 Dec;12(4):548-55. doi: 10.1208/s12248-010-9216-y.

The target proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K was identified as a novel autoantigen. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed high titers of anti-hnRNP K Abs in 85 (31%) of 273 patients with AA. Sixty-four patients received antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine after undergoing screening for anti-hnRNP K Ab, anti-DRS-1 Ab, anti-moesin Ab, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells. Twenty (87%) of 23 patients with the presence of anti-hnRNP K Abs responded to the immunosuppressive therapy (IST), while 19 (46%) of 41 patients without the presence of anti-hnRNP K Abs responded. A multivariate analysis showed only PNH-type cells and anti-hnRNP K Abs to be significant factors for the prediction of a good response to IST. The detection of anti-hnRNP K Abs as well as PNH-type cells may therefore be useful for diagnosing the immune pathophysiology of AA.","['Qi, Zhirong', 'Takamatsu, Hiroyuki', 'Espinoza, J Luis', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Sugimori, Naomi', 'Yamazaki, Hirohito', 'Okawa, Katsuya', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Qi Z', 'Takamatsu H', 'Espinoza JL', 'Lu X', 'Sugimori N', 'Yamazaki H', 'Okawa K', 'Nakao S']","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, 920-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100710,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/immunology/physiopathology', 'Autoantibodies/*blood/immunology', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/14 06:00,2011/02/03 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1020-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Dec;89(12):1255-63. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1020-3.

Several case reports suggest that HU may have minimal or no teratogenic effects on the developing human fetus. Fourteen cases of HU therapy in pregnant patients diagnosed with acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia, primary thrombocythemia, or sickle cell disease (SCD) have been reported. Three pregnancies were terminated by elective abortion; 1 woman developed eclampsia and delivered a phenotypically normal stillborn infant. All other patients delivered live, healthy infants without congenital anomalies. We contend that case studies such as these have too few patients and cannot effectively address the adverse effect of HU on preimplantation embryo or fetuses. The objective of this study was to assess the risks associated with a clinically relevant dose of HU used for the treatment of SCD, on ovulation rate and embryo development, using adult C57BL/6J female mice as a model. In Experiment 1, adult female mice were randomly assigned to a treatment or a control group (N = 20/group). Treatment consisted of oral HU (30 mg/kg) for 28 days; while control mice received saline (HU vehicle). Five days to the cessation of HU dosing, all mice were subjected to folliculogenesis induction with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Five mice/group were anesthetized at 48 hours post PMSG to facilitate blood collection via cardiac puncture for estradiol-17beta (E(2)) measurement by RIA. Ovulation was induced in the remaining mice at 48 hours post PMSG with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and immediately caged with adult males for mating. Five plugged female mice/group were sacrificed for the determination of ovulation rate. The remaining mated mice were sacrificed about 26 hours post hCG, ovaries excised and weighed and embryos harvested and cultured in Whitten's medium (WM) supplemented with CZBt. In Experiments 2 and 3, (N = 10/Experiment) folliculogenesis and ovulation were induced in untreated mice followed by mating. Recovered embryos were either exposed continuously (Experiment 2) or intermittently (Experiment 3) to bioavailable HU (18 microg HU/mL of WM + CZBt) or WM + CZBt only (control). Treated mice sustained decreased ovarian wt, ovulation rate and circulating E(2) compared with controls (P < 0.05). Fewer embryos retrieved from HU-treated mice developed to blastocyst stage (32%) compared with those from controls (60%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, continuous or intermittent in vitro exposures of embryos to HU also resulted in reduced development to blastocyst stage (continuous HU, 9 vs. control, 63%; P < 0.05; intermittent HU, 20 vs. control, 62%; P < 0.05) with embryos exposed continuously to HU in vitro fairing worse. Even though HU is well tolerated, our data suggest that it compromises folliculogenesis and the ability of generated embryos to develop. Therefore, designed studies with larger numbers of patients receiving HU during pregnancy, with longer follow-up of exposed children and more careful assessment of embryo/fetotoxic effects, are required before this agent can be promoted as safe in pregnancy.","['Sampson, Mariam', 'Archibong, Anthony E', 'Powell, Adriane', 'Strange, Brandon', 'Roberson, Shannon', 'Hills, Edward R', 'Bourne, Phillip']","['Sampson M', 'Archibong AE', 'Powell A', 'Strange B', 'Roberson S', 'Hills ER', 'Bourne P']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN 37208-3599, USA. msampson@mmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100428,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Blastocyst/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Radioimmunoassay']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph7052033 [doi]', 'ijerph7052033 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2010 May;7(5):2033-44. doi: 10.3390/ijerph7052033.

It may also cause hematological effects to people of all ages. Recent studies in our laboratory have indicated that apoptosis may be associated with the lead-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage. However, the mechanisms underlying its effect on lymphocytes are still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the apoptotic mechanisms of lead nitrate [Pb(NO(3))(2)] using HL-60 cells as a test model. HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of Pb(NO(3))(2) for 24 h prior to cell viability assay and flow cytometry assessment. The results obtained from the trypan blue exclusion test indicated that at very low concentration, Pb(NO(3))(2) has no effect on the viability of HL-60 cells. A significant (p < 0.05) decrease in cell viability was observed when exposed to high level of Pb(NO(3))(2). Data generated from the flow cytometric assessment indicated that Pb(NO(3))(2) exposure significantly (p < 0.05) increased the proportion of annexin V positive cells (apoptotic cells) compared to the control. Pb(NO(3))(2) induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells was associated with the activation of caspase-3. In summary, these studies demonstrated that Pb(NO(3))(2) represents an apoptosis-inducing agent in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and its apoptotic mechanism functions, at least in part via, induction of phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 activation.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Milner, Jessica N', 'Howard, Carolyn B', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Milner JN', 'Howard CB', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Cellomics and Toxicogenomics Research Laboratory, NIH-Center for Environmental Health, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, Jackson, MS 39217, USA. clement.yedjou@jsums.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100428,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['2P299V784P (Lead)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lead/*toxicity']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijerph7052008 [doi]', 'ijerph7052008 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2010 May;7(5):2008-17. doi: 10.3390/ijerph7052008.

The median age, unrelated transplants and co-morbidity index were higher in the RIC group. Median OS and EFS were 31.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.8-59.3) and 20.7 months (95% CI: 11.0-30.4), respectively, with no significant difference between the two cohorts. The 3-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) and relapse were 28% (95% CI: 21-39) and 25% (95% CI: 17-36), respectively, with no significant difference between the two cohorts. No difference in OS, EFS, TRM or relapse was observed between the two cohorts in the multivariate model. Only disease risk was significantly associated with OS (Hazard ratio (HR): 1.85, CI: 1.01-3.45), EFS (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.00-3.10) and cumulative relapse (HR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.08-10.12).

However, the transient and partial responses observed in AML patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors, coupled with the discovery of drug-resistant leukemic blast cells in AML patients, have made resistance to FLT3 inhibitors a growing concern.

Before the onset of T-ALL, thymic development was perturbed, with accumulation of cells that had passed through the beta-selection checkpoint without first expressing the T cell antigen receptor beta-chain (TCRbeta). Notch1 expression was higher in untransformed thymocytes in the absence of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2. Both RBPs interacted with evolutionarily conserved AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of Notch1 and suppressed its expression.

A comprehensive analysis, presented in seven companion papers, has produced estimates of tissue-specific radiation absorbed dose to MI residents at all historically inhabited atolls from internal (ingested) and external irradiation resulting from exposure to radioactive fallout, by calendar year, and by age of the population at time of exposure. The present report deals, for the first time, with the implications of these doses for cancer risk among exposed members of the MI population. Radiation doses differed by geographic location and year of birth, and radiation-related cancer risk depends upon age at exposure and age at observation for risk. Using dose-response models based on committee reports published by the National Research Council and the National Institutes of Health, we project that, during the lifetimes of members of the MI population potentially exposed to ionizing radiation from weapons test fallout deposited during the testing period (1948-1958) and from residual radioactive sources during the subsequent 12 y (1959-1970), perhaps 1.6% (with 90% uncertainty range 0.4% to 3.4%) of all cancers might be attributable to fallout-related radiation exposures. By sub-population, the projected proportion of cancers attributable to radiation from fallout from all nuclear tests conducted in the Marshall Islands is 55% (28% to 69%) among 82 persons exposed in 1954 on Rongelap and Ailinginae, 10% (2.4% to 22%) for 157 persons exposed on Utrik, and 2.2% (0.5% to 4.8%) and 0.8% (0.2% to 1.8%), respectively, for the much larger populations exposed in mid-latitude locations including Kwajalein and in southern locations including Majuro. By cancer type, point estimates of attributable risk varied, by location, between 12% and 95% for thyroid cancer, between 2% and 78% for leukemia, and between 0.8% and 55% for all cancers combined. The largest projected risks pertain to the Rongelap Island community and the lowest risks pertain to the populations resident on the southern-most atolls. While the projected cancer risks are smaller than those estimated by the National Cancer Institute in a more simplistic analysis conducted in 2004, these estimates of cancer risk are the best available as they are based on the most detailed dose reconstruction to date and comprehensively include populations at all locations and dose contributions from all nuclear tests.","['Land, Charles E', 'Bouville, Andre', 'Apostoaei, Iulian', 'Simon, Steven L']","['Land CE', 'Bouville A', 'Apostoaei I', 'Simon SL']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioactive Fallout)', '0 (Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Burden', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/adverse effects/analysis', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Micronesia/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/chemically induced/classification/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Weapons', '*Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Monitoring', 'Radioactive Fallout/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Radioisotopes/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/08/31 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e3181dc4e84 [doi]', '00004032-201008000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2010 Aug;99(2):201-15. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e3181dc4e84.,,,"['Y03 CO5117/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP010185-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Y3-CO-5117/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y2-AI-5077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3892964,,,,['NIHMS527909'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Slug (SNAI2, Snail2) is involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition in physiological and in pathological contexts. We show here that in embryonic kidney, colon carcinoma, chronic myeloid leukemia-blast crisis, and in neuroblastoma cells, expression of Slug is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myb via Myb binding sites in the 5'-flanking region and in the first intron of the slug gene. In embryonic kidney and neuroblastoma cells, c-Myb induced vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin expression and membrane ruffling via actin polymerization consistent with the acquisition of a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Furthermore, down-regulation of endogenous c-Myb levels in colon carcinoma cells led to increased expression of E-cadherin and reduced levels of vimentin. Some of these changes are predominantly Slug-dependent as Slug silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) reverts the cells to a quasi-parental condition. Changes in gene expression and morphology induced by c-Myb-activated Slug correlated with increased ability to migrate (embryonic kidney) and to invade through a Matrigel membrane (embryonic kidney, colon carcinoma, neuroblastoma). c-Myb-dependent Slug expression was also essential for the homing of chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells to the bone marrow. In summary, we show here that the proto-oncogene c-Myb controls Slug transcription in tumor cells of different origin. Such a regulatory pathway contributes to the acquisition of invasive properties that are important for the metastatic process.","['Tanno, Barbara', 'Sesti, Fabiola', 'Cesi, Vincenzo', 'Bossi, Gianluca', 'Ferrari-Amorotti, Giovanna', 'Bussolari, Rita', 'Tirindelli, Donatella', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Raschella, Giuseppe']","['Tanno B', 'Sesti F', 'Cesi V', 'Bossi G', 'Ferrari-Amorotti G', 'Bussolari R', 'Tirindelli D', 'Calabretta B', 'Raschella G']","['Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), Research Center Casaccia, Laboratory of Radiation Biology and Biomedicine, 00123 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100711,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (SNAI1 protein, human)', '0 (SNAI2 protein, human)', '0 (Snai1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Snai2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/*metabolism', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)52663-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.089045 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Sep 17;285(38):29434-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.089045.

This article compares historical control (HC) tumor incidence rates from these nine SD rat studies with HC tumor rates from matched NTP F344/N rat bioassays to identify similarities and differences. Matching on sex, laboratory, diet, and route led to nine comparable F344/N rat studies. Our analyses revealed statistically significant strain differences, with female SD rats having lower incidence rates for clitoral gland adenoma (0.2% vs. 5.8%) and mononuclear cell leukemia (0.9% vs. 16.7%) and higher incidence rates for mammary gland fibroadenoma (67.4% vs. 48.4%), mammary gland carcinoma (10.2% vs. 2.4%), and thyroid gland C cell adenoma (25.4% vs. 13.6%) relative to female F344/N rats. These represent five of the seven most common tumor types among female SD and F344/N rats in the NTP HC database.

Recently, gain-of-function mutations in the alpha helical structure within the linker sequence of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL have been associated with AML. We identified four novel CBL mutations, including a point mutation (Y371H) and a putative splice site mutation in AML specimens. Characterization of these two CBL mutants revealed that coexpression with the receptor tyrosine kinases FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) or KIT-induced ligand independent growth or ligand hyperresponsiveness, respectively. Growth of cells expressing mutant CBL required expression and kinase activity of FLT3. In addition to the CBL-dependent phosphorylation of FLT3 and CBL itself, transformation was associated with activation of Akt and STAT5 and required functional expression of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Furthermore, the mutations led to constitutively elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, which is commonly linked to increased glucose metabolism in cancer cells. Inhibition of hexokinase with 2-deoxyglucose blocked the transforming activity of CBL mutants and reduced activation of signaling mechanisms. Overall, our data demonstrate that mutations of CBL alter cellular biology at multiple levels and require not only the activation of receptor proximal signaling events but also an increase in cellular glucose metabolism. Pathways that are activated by CBL gain-of-function mutations can be efficiently targeted by small molecule drugs.","['Fernandes, Margret S', 'Reddy, Mamatha M', 'Croteau, Nicole J', 'Walz, Christoph', 'Weisbach, Henry', 'Podar, Klaus', 'Band, Hamid', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Salgia, Ravi', 'Griffin, James D', 'Sattler, Martin']","['Fernandes MS', 'Reddy MM', 'Croteau NJ', 'Walz C', 'Weisbach H', 'Podar K', 'Band H', 'Carroll M', 'Reiter A', 'Larson RA', 'Salgia R', 'Griffin JD', 'Sattler M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100709,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47310-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.106161 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Oct 15;285(42):32596-605. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.106161.

A structural analysis of their selectivity profiles has been generated from the synthesis and evaluation of 8 additional DFG-out allosteric inhibitors that were developed directly from fragments of these successful scaffolds.","['Dietrich, Justin', 'Hulme, Christopher', 'Hurley, Laurence H']","['Dietrich J', 'Hulme C', 'Hurley LH']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85719, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100604,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (DFG peptide)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14)', 'HO1A8B3YVV (doramapimod)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Benzenesulfonates/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Design', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Naphthalenes/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Oligopeptides/*chemistry', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(10)00494-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2010.05.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2010 Aug 1;18(15):5738-48. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2010.05.063.

To our knowledge, no cases of large-cell transformation of composite lymphoma have yet been described. We report the case of a patient who presented with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) fifteen years after successful treatment for a mature B-cell lymphoma. Reassessment of the patient's lymph node from 1995, using techniques not previously available, resulted in a revised diagnosis of composite lymphoma, comprising both follicular lymphoma (FL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Analysis of B-cell gene rearrangement studies using BIOMED-2-based PCR, and of t(14;18) rearrangements by both FISH and PCR, provided evidence that the DLBCL evolved from transformation of the composite lymphoma, specifically from its FL component. B-cell gene rearrangement studies also supported a clonal relationship between the FL and SLL components of the composite lymphoma.","['diSibio, Guy', 'Gabor, E Peter', 'Lopategui, Jean', 'Sabath, Daniel E', 'Alsabeh, Randa', 'Cole, Justin M']","['diSibio G', 'Gabor EP', 'Lopategui J', 'Sabath DE', 'Alsabeh R', 'Cole JM']","['Dept of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. gdisibio@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100715,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(10)00098-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2010 Dec;89(3):260-7. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.07.001.

This includes inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases required for the activation of RNA polymerase II, as well as homoharringtonine and silvestrol, the natural compounds that inhibit translation. As their actions are independent of p53 or ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) function, agents that act by such mechanisms are promising to overcome resistance to current CLL therapy.

Additional monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20, CD23, CD37, CD38 or CD40, as well as drugs designed to interfere with proteins regulating the cell cycle, apoptotic machinery or leukaemic microenvironment (e.g., flavopiridol, oblimersen, ABT-263 or lenalidomide) are investigated in clinical trials. An increased experience with reduced-intensity allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation allows offering this option to physically fit patients. This review attempts to summarise the current use of these different modalities in CLL therapy.","['Hallek, Michael']",['Hallek M'],"['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Center for Integrated Oncology Koln Bonn, Universitat zu Koln, Joseph-Stelzmann Str. 9, 50924 Koln, Germany. michael.hallek@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Based on the assessment of B cell receptor (BCR) structure and function, a subdivision into subtypes is possible (e.g., immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene segment (IGHV) unmutated and mutated, V3-21 usage) with distinct biological and clinical characteristics. Recurrent genomic aberrations (i.e., 11q and 17p deletion) and gene mutations (i.e., TP53 and ATM) help to define biological and clinical subgroups. In addition, serum markers (e.g., thymidine kinase (TK) and beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG)), cellular markers (e.g., CD38 and ZAP70) and clinical staging have an impact on outcome in CLL. The biological characterisation of CLL has not only led to progress in outcome prediction but also has begun to be translated into novel treatment strategies. Nonetheless, most factors associated with prognosis have not been thoroughly interrogated for their predictive value in the light of different therapeutic approaches. With a growing number of agents acting on specific biological targets and being used in different clinical situations, the future is likely to bring the identification of predictive factors in CLL.","['Zenz, Thorsten', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Zenz T', 'Frohling S', 'Mertens D', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

These autoimmune cytopaenias can occur at any stage of CLL and do not have independent prognostic significance. The most common autoimmune complication is autoimmune haemolytic anaemia with a lower frequency of immune thrombocytopaenia and pure red blood cell aplasia and only rarely, autoimmune granulocytopaenia (AIG). Autoimmune cytopaenia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of cytopaenia in patients with CLL. Patients with CLL can also have more than one form of autoimmune cytopaenia, which can occur together with bone-marrow failure. Treatment is usually effective but rarely curative for autoimmune cytopaenia complicating CLL. Optimal therapy will depend on a timely and accurate diagnosis of autoimmune cytopaenia and should be individualised according to the severity of the cytopaenia and the presence or absence of concomitant progressive CLL requiring therapy.","['Zent, Clive S', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Zent CS', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. zent.clive@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

However, cell surface and intracellular phenotypes suggest that most CLL cells are activated cells, although only a small subset progresses beyond the G1 stage of the cell cycle. In addition, traditional teaching says that CLL cells divide rarely, and therefore the build-up of leukaemic cells is due to an inherent defect in cell death. However, in vivo labelling of CLL cells indicates a much more active rate of cell birth than originally estimated, suggesting that CLL is a dynamic disease. Here we review the observations that have led to these altered views of the activation state and proliferative capacities of CLL cells and also provide our interpretation of these observations in light of their potential impact on patients.","['Damle, Rajendra N', 'Calissano, Carlo', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Damle RN', 'Calissano C', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. rdamle@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Genetic defects and stimuli originating from the microenvironment concur to the selection and expansion of the malignant clone. Several lines of evidence, including molecular and functional analysis of the monoclonal immunoglobulin, support the hypothesis that stimulation through the B-cell receptor affects life and death of leukaemic cells. The microenvironment also has a critical role in the survival and accumulation of leukaemic cells within lymphoid organs where signals delivered from the surrounding cells are likely crucial in inducing proliferation. Nevertheless, several major biological issues still remain to be solved including regulation of the balance between proliferation and survival of leukaemic cells and the links between emerging gene abnormalities and microenvironment.

Morphologically, CLL can be classified into typical and atypical. Immunophenotyping is the only method that can establish or confirm the diagnosis as CLL lymphocytes have a distinct immunophenotypic signature. A scoring system compounding the results with a set of markers allows firming up the diagnosis. Other immunological markers such as CD38 and ZAP-70 have an important prognostic impact. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, chiefly by detecting 17p (TP53 locus) and 11q (ATM) deletions and mutational status of the IgVH gene, also provides prognostic information and may determine the type of therapy.

Molecular analysis of influenza-specific T cells revealed persistence of many subdominant clones in the Pmaip1(-/-) effector pool.

Metnase (also termed SETMAR) is a fusion of a histone methylase and transposase protein that arose specifically in primates. Transposases were thought to be extinct in primates because they would mediate deleterious DNA movement. In primates, Metnase interacts with DNA Ligase IV (Lig IV) and promotes nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. We show here that the primate-specific protein Metnase can also enhance NHEJ in murine cells and can also interact with murine Lig IV, indicating that it integrated into the preexisting NHEJ pathway after its development in primates. Significantly, expressing Metnase in murine cells significantly reduces chromosomal translocations. We propose that the fusion of the histone methylase SET domain and the transposase domain in the anthropoid lineage to form primate Metnase promotes accurate intrachromosomal NHEJ and thereby suppresses interchromosomal translocations. Metnase may have been selected for because it has a function opposing transposases and may thus play a key role in suppressing translocations that underlie oncogenicity.","['Wray, Justin', 'Williamson, Elizabeth A', 'Chester, Sean', 'Farrington, Jacqueline', 'Sterk, Rosa', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Jasin, Maria', 'Lee, Suk-Hee', 'Nickoloff, Jac A', 'Hromas, Robert']","['Wray J', 'Williamson EA', 'Chester S', 'Farrington J', 'Sterk R', 'Weinstock DM', 'Jasin M', 'Lee SH', 'Nickoloff JA', 'Hromas R']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Cancer Research and Treatment Center, Department of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (mariner transposases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Ligase ATP', 'DNA Ligases/physiology', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*physiology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transposases/*physiology']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2009/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00163-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Jul 15;200(2):184-90. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.04.011.,,,"['R01 HL093606/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139429-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK0075-20/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093606-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093606-02S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140422-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL093606/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084020/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2904321,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we report a novel conventional and molecular cytogenetic study of two CLL patients carrying interstitial del(5q) in order to contribute to the identification of rare recurrent aberrations and their prognostic impact in CLL. Karyotypic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis that used probes for the most common aberrations of CLL demonstrated that del(5q) was the sole chromosome abnormality in both patients at the time of diagnosis. None of these patients had a history of exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Both patients had disease that was still staged as Binet A at 28 and 18 months after diagnosis, respectively, without receiving any therapy because of their good clinical condition. Therefore, it could be suggested that del(5q) may not be associated with an adverse prognosis in CLL and is not related with therapy-induced chromosome changes. Further studies are required to elucidate the prognostic value of these deletions in more CLL patients, which could be advisable for prognostic and therapeutic purposes, as well as to identify candidate genes that may potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Karakosta, Maria', 'Tsakiridou, Anastasia', 'Korantzis, Ioannis', 'Manola, Kalliopi N']","['Karakosta M', 'Tsakiridou A', 'Korantzis I', 'Manola KN']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics, NCSR Demokritos, Terma Patriarchou Grigoriou & Neapoleos, Aghia Paraskevi, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00153-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Jul 15;200(2):175-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.04.002.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This method allows the detection of gains and losses of genetic material at a resolution lower than 5 Mb. The limitations of conventional cytogenetic studies, such as morphologically insufficient quality of metaphases or the mitotic index, can be eliminated by use of CGH. It is particularly important in the diagnosis of leukemias, and CGH could be a useful tool enabling more precise cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells. A group of 89 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was studied by means of CGH using bone marrow obtained from all consecutive pediatric patients. CGH experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction with minor modifications. In addition, each sample was examined with standard GTG technique and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The conventional cytogenetics failed in 12 patients (13.5%), and 22 patients (24.7%) had a normal karyotype. Structural and numerical changes were found in 55 cases (61.8%) displaying a different abnormalities including deletions, trisomies, tetrasomies, isochromosomes, and markers with unknown origin. However, all samples were successfully analyzed by CGH. We have shown that high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization analysis is a reliable and relatively quick one-step method to identify main aberrations that would not be detected by either conventional G banding or by conventional fluorescence in situ hybridization.

EG is usually a cutaneous manifestation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection but other microbial agents can be involved. OBSERVATION: Four patients (three women and one man, mean age: 36 years) with fever and cutaneous black sores characteristic of EG were hospitalized. Three were cardiac transplant recipients treated with immunosuppressant drugs and one had end-stage acute myeloid leukaemia. All had cutaneous necrotic black sores. Blood cultures isolated in one case P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Bacteriological culture of cutaneous swabs from necrotic lesions revealed C. albicans and P. aeruginosa in two cases, respectively. The cutaneous black sores healed with appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Three patients were cured but the patient with leukaemia died despite therapy. DISCUSSION: These four cases illustrate the clinical polymorphism of EG and the broad spectrum of aetiologies. While EG is primarily considered a cutaneous manifestation of P. aeruginosa infection, other microbial agents such as C. albicans may be responsible, as in two of our cases.","['Soria, A', 'Frances, C', 'Guihot, A', 'Varnous, S', 'Bricaire, F', 'Caumes, E']","['Soria A', 'Frances C', 'Guihot A', 'Varnous S', 'Bricaire F', 'Caumes E']","[""Service de maladies infectieuses et tropicales, hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, 45-83, boulevard de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100611,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candida albicans/isolation & purification', 'Ecthyma/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Gangrene/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation & purification', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases, Bacterial/drug therapy/*microbiology']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(10)00223-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2010.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2010 Jun-Jul;137(6-7):472-6. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2010.04.013.

Successful development of an alternative treatment approach with thrombopoietin agonists was nearly thwarted when early formulations of recombinant thrombopoietin agonists elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with and neutralized endogenous thrombopoietin. The effectiveness of these recombinant agents led to the development of second-generation thrombopoietin receptor agonists that do not induce cross-reacting neutralizing antibodies against thrombopoietin.

The impact of this policy on the incidence of ICVC removal within 100 days of placement was evaluated. METHODS: The records of all children with hematologic malignancies who underwent placement of an ICVC (port or cuffed catheter) from 1999 through 2008 were reviewed. The incidence of catheter removal within 100 days was compared between subjects who had ICVC placed before (preprotocol) and after (postprotocol) the absolute neutrophil count-based exclusion protocol. RESULTS: Implanted central venous catheters were placed in 437 children, 311 in group 1 and 126 in group 2. The incidence of catheter removal within 100 days of placement for infection (4.1% [13/314] versus 0.8% [1/126], P = .07) and all causes combined (9.6% [30/314] versus 2.4% [3/126], P = .01) was substantially lower in the postprotocol group.

As increased incidence of cancer in residential areas close to petrochemical industries has been reported in the literature, we conducted a study of cancer incidence in Stenungsund, Sweden, where petrochemical industries were established in the mid 1960s. A number of cancer cases in the central parts of Stenungsund were collected from the regional cancer registry for each year between 1974 and 2005. In addition to the total number of cases, the numbers of leukemia, lymphoma, liver cancer, lung cancer, and brain cancer were also collected. Expected numbers for each year were calculated based on age- and sex-specific incidence rates in reference areas. Levels of carcinogenic volatile hydrocarbons (VOC) were estimated from measurements and emission data. A dispersion model was used to classify Stenungsund into a ""low"" and ""high"" ethylene level area. Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) for all cancer for the entire period was 1.02 (95% CI 0.97-1.08). The occurrence of leukemia, lymphoma, and cancer in the central nervous system was slightly lower than expected for the entire period. SIR for lung cancer was 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.69), and SIR for liver cancer was 1.50 (0.82-2.53). VOC levels were low.

In this article, we address a meta-analysis of the gene expression data on imatinib resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia. First, an analysis of the overlapping among 6 published studies revealed that only 3 genes were coincident between 2 studies. A later reprocessing using different methods on 4 publicly available datasets revealed that 2 extra genes were overlapped between two sets. Both poor overlappings may be due to large differences in the sample source, the microarray platforms used, and a small difference in gene expression between the imatinib non-responder and responder patients. A search of common genes inside 4 public datasets afforded 404 well defined genes. Nevertheless, this necessary condition for meta-analysis caused the loss of many genes of possible interest. The expression signals of the common genes in the four datasets were reanalyzed using three summary statistical methods for combining quantitative information: Fisher, Stouffer and effect-size. Taking the three methods together and using an FDR<0.10 threshold, a gene-list with 33 differentially expressed genes was found. Considering all the reanalysis approaches used in this work, a final gene-list with 38 differentially expressed genes is reported. Despite the important limitations to this microarray meta-analysis, the presented procedures and integrated gene-list may have some potential value as regards imatinib resistance in CML patients since it is the first attempt to integrate evidence about gene-lists in this area.","['Burguillo, Francisco J', 'Martin, Javier', 'Barrera, Inmaculada', 'Bardsley, William G']","['Burguillo FJ', 'Martin J', 'Barrera I', 'Bardsley WG']","['Departamento de Quimica Fisica, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad de Salamanca, 37080 Salamanca, Spain. burgui@usal.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20100618,England,Comput Biol Chem,Computational biology and chemistry,101157394,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1476-9271(10)00046-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2010.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Chem. 2010 Jun;34(3):184-92. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2010.06.003.

Aven has been identified as an antiapoptotic protein and has been shown to activate ATM in response to DNA damage. In this study, we demonstrated that enforced expression of Aven blocks UV-irradiation-, SN-38- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis upstream of mitochondria by stabilising Bcl-xL protein levels in breast cancer cells. Aven silencing by RNA interference markedly enhanced apoptotic response following treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Aven is complexed with Bcl-xL in untreated breast cancer cells and treatment with DNA-damaging agents led to decreased Aven/Bcl-xL interaction. Importantly, Bcl-xL was necessary for the prosurvival activity of Aven and depletion of Bcl-xL abrogated Aven-mediated protection against DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Analysis of breast cancer tissue microarrays revealed decreased Aven nuclear expression in breast cancer tissues compared with non-neoplastic breast tissues. In particular, we detected reduced nuclear expression of Aven in infiltrating ductal carcinoma and papillary carcinoma breast cancer subtypes compared with non-neoplastic breast tissues and infiltrating lobular breast cancer tissues. Our results suggest that Aven is an important mediator in DNA damage-induced apoptotic signalling in breast cancer cells and its nuclear expression is altered in breast cancer tissues, which may contribute to genomic instability in breast cancer tumours.","['Kutuk, Ozgur', 'Temel, Sehime Gulsun', 'Tolunay, Sahsine', 'Basaga, Huveyda']","['Kutuk O', 'Temel SG', 'Tolunay S', 'Basaga H']","['Biological Sciences and Bioengineering Program, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Engineering, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100707,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (AVEN protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/28 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)00486-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.06.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Sep;46(13):2494-505. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.06.011.

We have used a shRNA-based loss-of-function screen to isolate factors other than TRIM5alpha involved in the restriction of N-MLV. In one of the isolated clones, the shRNA expressed was found to target the murine double minute-2 mRNA. Knocking down MDM2 increased N-MLV and EIAV infection of human cells by 2- to 5-fold while having little effect on B-MLV. Similarly, knocking down MDM2 in African green monkey cells diminished the restriction of both N-MLV and HIV-1. Dual knockdown experiments showed that MDM2 was involved in the restriction mediated by TRIM5alpha. Moreover, MDM2 knockdown decreased the sensitivity of N-MLV infection to treatment with MG132 and As(2)O(3), two known TRIM5alpha pharmacological inhibitors.

BGs are devoid of cytoplasmic content and possess all bacterial bio-adhesive surface properties in their original state while not posing any infectious threat. BGs are ideally suited as an advanced drug delivery system (ADDS) for toxic substances in tumor therapy. The inner space of BGs can be loaded with either single components or combinations of peptides, drugs or DNA which provides an opportunity to design new types of (polyvalent) drug delivery vehicles. Uptake of BGs loaded with Doxorubicin (Dox) by CaCo2 cells led to effective Dox release from endo-lysosomal compartments and accumulation in the nucleus. Viability and proliferative capacity of the cells were significantly decreased (2-3 orders of magnitude) after internalization of Dox loaded BGs as compared to cells incubated with free Dox. The same effect was observed with leukemia cells. Melanoma cells also revealed a high capability to internalize BGs. These results indicate that BGs are able to target a range of types of cancer. BGs have also been investigated as DNA delivery vectors. Studies show DNA loaded BGs are efficiently phagocytosed and internalized by both professional APCs and tumor cells with up to 82% of cells expressing the plasmid-encoded reporter gene. Our studies with BGs as an ADDS system contribute (i) to optimize drug delivery for the treatment of cancer; (ii) define specific conditions for selection and preparation of BG formulations; (iii) and provide a background for the clinical application of BGs in cancer therapy.","['Kudela, Pavol', 'Koller, Verena Juliana', 'Lubitz, Werner']","['Kudela P', 'Koller VJ', 'Lubitz W']","['BIRD-C GmbH&CoKEG, Kritzendorf, Austria. pavol.kudela@bird-c.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100707,Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Phagocytosis']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0264-410X(10)00928-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.06.087 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2010 Aug 16;28(36):5760-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.06.087.

This study investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying adaphostin induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) which plays a significant role in modulation of drug-induced toxicity in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line model, NCI-H522. METHODS: The transcriptional response of NCI-H522 to adaphostin prominently involved oxidative stress genes, particularly HMOX1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was additionally established by generation of ROS prior to modulation of adaphostin-toxicity with antioxidants. To identify up-stream regulatory elements of HMOX1, immunofluorescence was used to evaluate nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), in the presence of adaphostin. The PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, was employed as a pharmacological inhibitor of this process. RESULTS: Generation of ROS provided a substantial foundation for the sensitivity of NCI-H522 to adaphostin. However, in contrast to leukemia cell lines, transcriptional response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of HMOX1, which was dependent on nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf2. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin inhibited translocation of Nrf2 and induction of HMOX1. Wortmannin pretreatment was also able to diminish adaphostin induction of HMOX1, and as a consequence, enhance the toxicity of adaphostin to NCI-H522. CONCLUSIONS: Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress in NCI-H522 was mediated through nuclear translocation of Nrf2 leading to upregulation of HMOX1. Inhibition of Nrf2 translocation by wortmannin inhibited this cytoprotective response, and enhanced the toxicity of adaphostin, suggesting that inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, such as wortmannin, might augment the antiproliferative effects of adaphostin in solid tumors that depend on the Nrf2/ARE pathway for protection against oxidative stress.","['Fer, Nicole D', 'Shoemaker, Robert H', 'Monks, Anne']","['Fer ND', 'Shoemaker RH', 'Monks A']","['Laboratory of Functional Genomics, SAIC-Frederick Inc., NCI-Frederick, 1050 Boyles Street, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100709,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-29-91 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-29-91 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jul 9;29:91. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-29-91.,,,['N01-CO12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2909968,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore investigated the frequencies of various T cell subsets (TC1, TH1, TH17) and CD25+ FoxP3+ TREG cells in AML patients with untreated disease and following intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Relative levels of circulating TC1 and TH1 cells were decreased in patients with severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, whereas TH17 levels did not differ from healthy controls. Increased levels of regulatory CD25+ FoxP3+ T cells were detected in AML patients with untreated disease, during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia and during regeneration after treatment. TH17 and TH1 levels were significantly higher in healthy males than females, but this gender difference was not detected during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. Finally, exogenous IL17-A usually had no or only minor effects on proliferation of primary human AML cells.

Despite the recognition that these genetic lesions cooperate in leukemogenesis, there have been no mechanistic studies addressing how TLX1 and NOTCH1 functionally interact to promote the leukemic phenotype. RESULTS: Global gene expression profiling after downregulation of TLX1 and inhibition of the NOTCH pathway in ALL-SIL cells revealed that TLX1 synergistically regulated more than 60% of the NOTCH-responsive genes. Structure-function analysis demonstrated that TLX1 binding to Groucho-related TLE corepressors was necessary for maximal transcriptional regulation of the NOTCH-responsive genes tested, implicating TLX1 modulation of the NOTCH-TLE regulatory network. Comparison of the dataset to publicly available biological databases indicated that the TLX1/NOTCH-coregulated genes are frequently targeted by MYC. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that MYC was an essential mediator of TLX1/NOTCH transcriptional output and growth promotion in ALL-SIL cells, with TLX1 contributing to the NOTCH-MYC regulatory axis by posttranscriptional enhancement of MYC protein levels. Functional classification of the TLX1/NOTCH-coregulated targets also showed enrichment for genes associated with other human cancers as well as those involved in developmental processes. In particular, we found that TLX1, NOTCH and MYC coregulate CD1B and RAG1, characteristic markers of early cortical thymocytes, and that concerted downregulation of the TLX1 and NOTCH pathways resulted in their irreversible repression. CONCLUSIONS: We found that TLX1 and NOTCH synergistically regulate transcription in T-ALL, at least in part via the sharing of a TLE corepressor and by augmenting expression of MYC. We conclude that the TLX1/NOTCH/MYC network is a central determinant promoting the growth and survival of TLX1+ T-ALL cells. In addition, the TLX1/NOTCH/MYC transcriptional network coregulates genes involved in T cell development, such as CD1 and RAG family members, and therefore may prescribe the early cortical stage of differentiation arrest characteristic of the TLX1 subgroup of T-ALL.","['Riz, Irene', 'Hawley, Teresa S', 'Luu, Truong V', 'Lee, Norman H', 'Hawley, Robert G']","['Riz I', 'Hawley TS', 'Luu TV', 'Lee NH', 'Hawley RG']","['Department of Anatomy and Regenerative Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100709,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Notch/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-181 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-181 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jul 9;9:181. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-181.,,,"['R01CA120316/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL65519/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL66305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2913983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought to be responsible for the extended survival of CLL cells in vivo. Dickkopf1 (DKK1) is known to antagonize Wnt signaling by direct high-affinity binding to the extracellular domain of WNT coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DKK1 in B-CLL cells in vitro. METHODS: Expression of DKK1 was estimated by Western blot and real-time PCR. B cells from patients with CLL and healthy donors were incubated with recombinant DKK1. Survival was measured by flow cytometry. Primers for real-time PCR were designed for extracellular domain of LRP6, responsible for DKK1 binding, and the intracellular region, essential for inhibiting GSK3 beta. RESULTS: Healthy and CLL cells express equivalent mRNA levels of DKK1 and LRP6. After treatment of CLL cells with recombinant DKK1 (1 mug/mL) for 3 h, there was no change in the levels of phosphorylated beta-catenin and total beta-catenin. Healthy B cells proved to have significantly higher levels of extracellular, DKK1 binding domain of LRP6. We estimated that in CLL cells every 6th LRP6 receptor is lacking the extracellular domain. DISCUSSION: For the first time we show the expression of DKK1 in CLL cells. Unlike in similar tumors, the addition of DKK1 to culture of CLL cells does not inactivate WNT pathway. The reason for this could be the absence of the binding domain of LRP6. On the other hand, a truncated LRP6 without extracellular DKK1 binding domain could lead to an uncontrollable activation of WNT signaling.","['Filipovich, Alexandra', 'Gandhirajan, Rajesh K', 'Gehrke, Iris', 'Poll-Wolbeck, Simon J', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Filipovich A', 'Gandhirajan RK', 'Gehrke I', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine I, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100830,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DKK1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LRP6 protein, human)', '0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Survival', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism']",2010/07/14 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1494 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01494.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Oct;85(4):309-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01494.x.

METHOD OF STUDY: We performed co cultures of trophoblast cells (Swan-71 cell line) or paternal antigens and PBMCs from patients with recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) and fertile women. RESULT: Fertile-CD4(+) LIF(+) cells were increased by VIP and progesterone in response to paternal and trophoblast antigens. Also MMP-9 activity was decreased and pSTAT3/STAT3 ratio was increased. RSA patients have decreased levels of LIF expression which could not be modulated by VIP and progesterone and displayed a reduced number of endometrial infiltrated CD4(+) LIF(+) cells compared with fertile women. CONCLUSION: The decrease of CD4(+) LIF(+) cells in RSA patients could be related with the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in the maternal-fetal dialogue model.","['Fraccaroli, Laura', 'Grasso, Esteban', 'Zeitler, Elena', 'Lombardi, Eduardo', 'Gogorza, Sebastian', 'Etchepareborda, Juan Jose', 'Nagle, Carlos', 'Cortelezzi, Marta', 'Perez Leiros, Claudia', 'Ramhorst, Rosanna']","['Fraccaroli L', 'Grasso E', 'Zeitler E', 'Lombardi E', 'Gogorza S', 'Etchepareborda JJ', 'Nagle C', 'Cortelezzi M', 'Perez Leiros C', 'Ramhorst R']","['Immunopharmacology Laboratory, School of Sciences FCEyN, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryo Implantation/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Pregnancy/*immunology', 'Progesterone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Trophoblasts/*immunology/metabolism', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/metabolism/pharmacology']",2010/07/14 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2010/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['AJI890 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0897.2010.00890.x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2011 Feb;65(2):133-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2010.00890.x.,,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on tumor-endothelial cell interaction in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In vitro, T-leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary T-leukemia/lymphoma cells were cultured with endothelial cells, either together or separately in Millicell Hanging Cell Culture system, the latter permits mutual cell exchange. At clinically achievable concentrations, in addition to a direct cytotoxicity on T-leukemia/lymphoma cells, bortezomib inhibited tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells and endothelial cell migration toward tumor cells. In vivo, a murine tumor xenograft model was achieved by subcutaneous injection of Jurkat cells. Bortezomib also triggered an inhibition on tumor-endothelial cell contact and subsequent tumor cell infiltration.

We sequenced mA3 genes from 38 inbred strains and wild mouse species, and compared the mouse sequence and predicted structure with human APOBEC3G (hA3G). An inserted sequence was identified in the virus restrictive C57BL strain allele that disrupts a splice donor site. This insertion represents the long terminal repeat of the xenotropic mouse gammaretrovirus, and was acquired in Eurasian mice that harbor xenotropic retrovirus. This viral regulatory sequence does not alter splicing but is associated with elevated mA3 expression levels in spleens of laboratory and wild-derived mice. Analysis of Mus mA3 coding sequences produced evidence of positive selection and identified 10 codons with very high posterior probabilities of having evolved under positive selection. Six of these codons lie in two clusters in the N-terminal catalytically active cytidine deaminase domain (CDA), and 5 of those 6 codons are polymorphic in Rfv3 virus restrictive and nonrestrictive mice and align with hA3G CDA codons that are critical for deaminase activity. Homology models of mA3 indicate that the two selected codon clusters specify residues that are opposite each other along the predicted CDA active site groove, and that one cluster corresponds to an hAPOBEC substrate recognition loop. Substitutions at these clustered mA3 codons alter antiviral activity. This analysis suggests that mA3 has been under positive selection throughout Mus evolution, and identified an inserted retroviral regulatory sequence associated with enhanced expression in virus resistant mice and specific residues that modulate antiviral activity.","['Sanville, Bradley', 'Dolan, Michael A', 'Wollenberg, Kurt', 'Yan, Yuhe', 'Martin, Carrie', 'Yeung, Man Lung', 'Strebel, Klaus', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Sanville B', 'Dolan MA', 'Wollenberg K', 'Yan Y', 'Martin C', 'Yeung ML', 'Strebel K', 'Buckler-White A', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100701,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Wild/genetics', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000974 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2010 Jul 1;6:e1000974. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000974.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2895647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work we focused on the mechanisms of anti-tumor action of effectors transduced with an anti-CD19 chimaeric receptor in the context of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Primary B-ALL blasts were efficiently killed by both z-CD19 CTL and z-CD19 CIK effectors. The use of death receptor mediated apoptosis of target cells was excluded since agonists molecules of Fas and TRAIL-receptors failed to induce cell death. Perforin/granzyme pathway was found to be the mechanism of chimaeric effectors mediated killing. Indeed, cytolytic effector molecules perforin as well as granzymes were highly expressed by CTL and CIK. CD19 specific stimulation of transduced effectors was associated with degranulation as attested by CD107 membrane expression and high IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha release. Moreover inhibitors of the perforin-based cytotoxic pathway, Ca(2+)-chelating agent EGTA and Concanamycin A, almost completely abrogated B-ALL blast killing.

AIMS: To determine the rates of ophthalmic disorders in adult patients with leukemia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective study of ocular disorders in adult patients with leukemia at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, between July 2004 and June 2008 was conducted. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The patients were interviewed and examined by the authors and the ocular findings were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using Instat GraphPad v2.05a statistical package software. The means, standard deviation, and the Kruskal-Wallis non parametric test were performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with leukemias were seen. Nineteen patients (40.4%) had CLL, 14(29.8%) had CML, 9(19.1%) had AML and 5(10.6%) had ALL. Seven patients (14.9%) had ocular disorders due to leukemia. The ocular disorders due to the leukemia were proptosis in two patients (4.3%), retinopathy in one patient (2.1%), conjunctival infiltration in one patient (2.1%), periorbital edema in one patient (2.1%), retinal detachment in one patient (2.1%), and subconjunctival hemorrhage in one patient (2.1%). There was no significant difference in rate of the ocular disorders in the various types of leukemia (Kruskal-Wallis KW= 4.019; corrected for ties. P=0.2595). One patient (2.1%) was blind from bilateral exudative retinal detachment while 1 patient (2.1%) had monocular blindness from mature cataract.

METHODS: Internet database searches and literature review. RESULTS: Bendamustine was approved in March 2008 by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Many trials have been performed over the last decade using bendamustine not only as monotherapy, but also in combination with other agents including rituximab, vincristine, mitoxantrone, fludarabine, and other agents as therapy for patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and recently was approved for use in therapy of patients with relapsed indolent lymphomas considered refractory to rituximab therapy. As monotherapy, bendamustine induces good responses with only minor side effects. In combination with other agents, efficacy improves, especially when given in combination with rituximab. The drug has also been studied in combination with rituximab as initial therapy for indolent lymphomas, and has excellent activity with less toxicity than R-CHOP (rituximab - cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin [Adriamycin], Oncovin [vincristine], and prednisone/prednisolone). CONCLUSION: Overall, bendamustine has demonstrated promising results as therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and should be included in the armamentarium of agents used to treat relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and may prove valuable as initial therapy for these diseases.

Nelarabine is converted to ara-G by adenosine deaminase and transported into cells by a nucleoside transporter. Ara-G is subsequently phosphorylated to ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP), thereby initiating the therapeutic effect by inhibiting DNA synthesis. Nelarabine has been extensively studied in regards to its pharmacokinetics, and the data have demonstrated that ara-GTP preferentially accumulates in malignant T-cells. Clinical responses to nelarabine have been demonstrated in various T-cell malignancies and appear to correlate with a relatively high intracellular concentration of ara-GTP compared to nonresponders. Therefore, this unique drug feature of nelarabine accounts for clinical utilization in treating adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Neuropathy is the most predominant adverse effect associated with nelarabine and the incidence correlates with the dose administered. Myelosuppression has been observed, with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia as the most common hematologic complications. This article reviews the pharmacology, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetic properties of nelarabine, as well as nelarabine's clinical efficacy in T-ALL, T-LBL, and other hematologic malignancies.

Intracellular pathways are still important in cancer development and their blockade directly affects outcome. Cross-talk has been observed but is not well understood. Vertical and horizontal pathway blockade are promising anticancer strategies. Indeed, preclinical and early clinical data suggest that combining superficial and intracellular blocking agents can synergize and leverage single-agent activity. The implication of the Akt signaling pathway in cancer is well established and has led to the development of new anticancer agents that block its activation.","['Calvo, Emiliano', 'Bolos, Victoria', 'Grande, Enrique']","['Calvo E', 'Bolos V', 'Grande E']","['Centro Integral Oncologico Clara Campal (CIOCC), Madrid.

Much progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms which underlie imatinib resistance. The most common cause of such drug resistance is the selection of leukemic clones with point mutations in the Abl kinase domain leading to amino acid substitutions which prevent the appropriate binding of the drug. Other mechanisms include genomic amplification of BCR-ABL and modulation of drug efflux or influx transporters. Dasatinib is a multi-target kinase inhibitor which has increased potency and is able to inhibit most Bcr-Abl mutant cell lines. Clinical trials of dasatinib in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoid leukemia have shown that it is effective and well tolerated. In this review, we will discuss the pre-clinical development of dasatinib, the clinical trial data demonstrating its efficacy and tolerability and highlight certain aspects of its toxicity profile and mechanisms of resistance.","['Chuah, Charles', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Chuah C', 'Melo JV']","['Singapore General Hospital and Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090218,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2009/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/ott.s3971 [doi]'],epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2009 Feb 18;2:83-94. doi: 10.2147/ott.s3971.,,,,PMC2886328,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'drug resistance', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of human MSI2 in a mouse model increases HSC cell cycle progression and cooperates with the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to induce an aggressive leukemia. MSI2 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemia cell lines, and its depletion leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.

Humoral and cellular immunity are both implicated, patients express a range of autoantibodies, but the targets of cellular immunity are not well defined. Autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-derived peptides constitute a significant proportion of the repertoire. METHODS: We have investigated the response to HLA-derived peptides after allogeneic BMT using gamma-interferon enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). We also studied the release of this gamma-interferon by flow cytometry in a subgroup of responsive patients. RESULTS: The peripheral blood mononuclear cell response was assessed by gamma-interferon ELISPOT in 42 BMT recipients (21 with cGVHD) and 30 healthy donors. Thirteen of 21 patients diagnosed with cGVHD responded to at least one HLA-derived peptide compared with 1 of 21 patients without cGVHD (62% vs. 5%, P<10) and 1 of 30 healthy donors. In all but one patient these peptides correspond with the sequences of autologous HLA. The median single peptide-specific response in ELISPOT was 43/10 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a subgroup studied by flow cytometry, gamma-interferon production to individual peptides occurred in 0.04% to 0.18% of CD4 T lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: These observations identify HLA-derived peptides as targets of a cellular immune response in cGVHD.","['Smith, Helen J', 'Hanvesakul, Rajesh', 'Morgan, Matthew D', 'Bentall, Andrew', 'Briggs, David', 'Clark, Fiona', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Moss, Paul', 'Larche, Mark', 'Ball, Simon']","['Smith HJ', 'Hanvesakul R', 'Morgan MD', 'Bentall A', 'Briggs D', 'Clark F', 'Pratt G', 'Moss P', 'Larche M', 'Ball S']","['Department of Renal Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK & School of Immunity, Infection and Inflammation, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e86b58 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2010 Sep 15;90(5):555-63. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e86b58.,,,['G9901249/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In almost all patients such infiltrates are detected in the bone marrow. Reliable immunohistochemical markers for the diagnosis and grading of SM have been established, but various differential diagnoses including myeloproliferative neoplasms, basophilic and eosinophilic leukemias may be very difficult to delineate. Even more challenging is the recognition of hematological neoplasms with signs of mast cell differentiation but not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for SM, especially the rare myelomastocytic leukemia. It is also important to separate the reactive state of mast cell hyperplasia from indolent variants of SM, especially those with a very low degree of bone marrow infiltration and absence of compact mast cell infiltrates. When the lymphocytic component of the SM infiltrate is very prominent, SM may be confused with an indolent lymphoma, especially lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma which almost always shows a marked reactive increase in mast cells. In aggressive and leukemic variants of SM, mast cells may be very atypical and devoid of metachromatic granules. This hypogranulation can be regarded as cellular atypia and may lead to the misdiagnosis aspect of monocytic leukemia or histiocytic neoplasm. Regarding immunohistochemical anomalies, mast cells in aggressive and leukemic SM have been found to express CD30 (Ki1-antigen). Thus, anaplastic large cell lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease may first be considered rather than SM. There is increasing evidence that most patients with long-standing adult-type urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions have in fact indolent SM. Therefore, such skin lesions are an important clue to the correct diagnosis in these patients. However, in aggressive or leukemic SM skin lesions are usually absent and then the correct diagnosis relies on an appropriate investigation of bone marrow biopsy specimens using both SM-related immunohistochemical markers (tryptase, KIT, CD25, CD30) but also markers excluding potential differential diagnoses. Investigation for presence of the activating KIT point mutation D816V is very helpful to establish a correct diagnosis of SM in all the difficult cases exhibiting a low degree of bone marrow infiltration or puzzling morphological findings.","['Horny, H-P', 'Sotlar, K', 'Valent, P']","['Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Valent P']","['Institute of Pathology, Ansbach, Germany. horny@patho-ansbach.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100707,Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,,IM,"['Adult', 'Basophils/immunology/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Point Mutation', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['000305552 [pii]', '10.1159/000305552 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2010;77(4):169-80. doi: 10.1159/000305552.

Methods with high clinical sensitivity and specificity adapted to the molecular laboratory workflow are required for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of AML with normal karyotype. We report here the development and evaluation of a novel, streamlined, RNA-based assay for the rapid multiplex detection of common NPM1 mutations in a 96-well assay format. Using synthetic transcripts and total RNA from leukemic cell lines, we show that the assay can specifically detect NPM1 wild-type and mutants A, B, D, or J transcripts in the same reaction. Dilution experiments indicate an assay dynamic range >4 log units with an analytical sensitivity of approximately 0.01%. Evaluation of 69 clinical specimens at initial diagnosis resulted in 100% agreement with reference methods. Of patients with AML with normal karyotype, 53% carried one of four different mutations. The assay was also combined with other laboratory-developed tests to simultaneously detect NPM1 mutant transcripts and fusion transcripts resulting from t(8;21) or inv(16) in a single reaction well. Overall, these results show that the assay is a versatile and specific tool for the screening of NPM1 mutations in patients with AML. Its high analytical sensitivity further suggests potential utility for the monitoring of residual disease in AML with normal karyotype.","['Hafez, Michael', 'Ye, Fei', 'Jackson, Keith', 'Yang, Zhe', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Labourier, Emmanuel', 'Gocke, Christopher D']","['Hafez M', 'Ye F', 'Jackson K', 'Yang Z', 'Karp JE', 'Labourier E', 'Gocke CD']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100708,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin']",2010/07/10 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60107-9 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090219 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2010 Sep;12(5):629-35. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090219.

Recently, several groups have identified new connections between the function of these factors and leukocyte responses in health and disease. Gene targeting of individual KLFs in mice has uncovered novel and unexpected physiologic roles among myeloid and lymphocyte cell lineage maturation, particularly in the bone marrow niche and blood. In addition, several KLF family members are downstream targets of stimuli and signaling pathways critical to T-cell trafficking, T regulatory cell differentiation or suppressor function, monocyte/macrophage activation or renewal, and B memory cell maturation or activation. Indeed, KLFs have been implicated in subtypes of leukemia, lymphoma, autoimmunity, and in acute and chronic inflammatory disease states, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and airway inflammation, raising the possibility that KLFs and their upstream signals are of therapeutic interest. This review focuses on the relevant literature of Kruppel-like factors in leukocyte biology and their implications in clinical settings.","['Cao, Zhuoxiao', 'Sun, Xinghui', 'Icli, Basak', 'Wara, Akm Khyrul', 'Feinberg, Mark W']","['Cao Z', 'Sun X', 'Icli B', 'Wara AK', 'Feinberg MW']","[""Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*cytology/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/07/10 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30993-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-285353 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 25;116(22):4404-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-285353.

Previous work showed that engineering the Fc domain of an antibody for increased binding to Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaRs) significantly enhanced Fc-mediated immune effector function and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. We developed a humanized anti-CD40 antibody similarly Fc-engineered for increased FcgammaR binding (XmAbCD40) and compared its efficacy with that of an anti-CD40 native IgG1 analog and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. XmAbCD40 increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) up to 150-fold relative to anti-CD40 IgG1 against B-lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines, and significantly enhanced ADCC against primary tumors. XmAbCD40 was also superior to rituximab in enhancing ADCC (both in cell lines and primary tumors) and in augmenting antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. XmAbCD40 significantly inhibited lymphoma growth in disseminated and established mouse xenografts and was more effective than the IgG1 analog or rituximab. An anti-CD40 antibody constructed to abrogate FcgammaR binding showed no reduction of tumor growth, indicating that the in vivo antitumor activity of XmAbCD40 is primarily mediated via FcgammaR-dependent mechanisms. These data demonstrate that XmAbCD40 displays potent antitumor efficacy and merits further evaluation for the treatment of CD40(+) malignancies.","['Horton, Holly M', 'Bernett, Matthew J', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Pong, Erik', 'Karki, Sher', 'Chu, Seung Y', 'Richards, John O', 'Chen, Hsing', 'Repp, Roland', 'Desjarlais, John R', 'Zhukovsky, Eugene A']","['Horton HM', 'Bernett MJ', 'Peipp M', 'Pong E', 'Karki S', 'Chu SY', 'Richards JO', 'Chen H', 'Repp R', 'Desjarlais JR', 'Zhukovsky EA']","['Xencor Inc, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology/*therapeutic use', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31228-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-265280 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):3004-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-265280.

Despite extensive work on the functional relevance of rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 complexes, much less is known on the roles of rapamycin-insensitive (RI) complexes, including mTORC2 and RI-mTORC1, in BCR-ABL-leukemogenesis. We provide evidence for the presence of mTORC2 complexes in BCR-ABL-transformed cells and identify phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Thr37/46 and Ser65 as RI-mTORC1 signals in primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Our studies establish that a unique dual mTORC2/mTORC1 inhibitor, OSI-027, induces potent suppressive effects on primitive leukemic progenitors from CML patients and generates antileukemic responses in cells expressing the T315I-BCR-ABL mutation, which is refractory to all BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors currently in clinical use. Induction of apoptosis by OSI-027 appears to negatively correlate with induction of autophagy in some types of BCR-ABL transformed cells, as shown by the induction of autophagy during OSI-027-treatment and the potentiation of apoptosis by concomitant inhibition of such autophagy. Altogether, our studies establish critical roles for mTORC2 and RI-mTORC1 complexes in survival and growth of BCR-ABL cells and suggest that dual therapeutic targeting of such complexes may provide an approach to overcome leukemic cell resistance in CML and Ph+ ALL.","['Carayol, Nathalie', 'Vakana, Eliza', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Kaur, Surinder', 'Goussetis, Dennis J', 'Glaser, Heather', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Donato, Nicholas J', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Barr, Sharon', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Carayol N', 'Vakana E', 'Sassano A', 'Kaur S', 'Goussetis DJ', 'Glaser H', 'Druker BJ', 'Donato NJ', 'Altman JK', 'Barr S', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

We have shifted the integration preferences of retroviral vectors by generating a library of viral variants with a DNA-binding domain inserted at random positions throughout murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol, then selecting for variants that are viable and exhibit altered integration properties. We found seven permissive zinc finger domain (ZFD) insertion sites throughout Gag-Pol, including within p12, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. Comprehensive genome integration analysis showed that several ZFD insertions yielded retroviral vector variants with shifted integration patterns that did not favor TSS. Furthermore, integration site analysis revealed selective integration for numerous mutants. For example, two retroviral variants with a given ZFD at appropriate positions in Gag-Pol strikingly integrated primarily into four common sites out of 3.1 x 10(9) possible human genome locations (P = 4.6 x 10(-29)). Our findings demonstrate that insertion of DNA-binding motifs into multiple locations in Gag-Pol can make considerable progress toward engineering safer retroviral vectors that integrate into a significantly narrowed pool of sites on human genome and overcome the preference for TSS.","['Lim, Kwang-il', 'Klimczak, Ryan', 'Yu, Julie H', 'Schaffer, David V']","['Lim KI', 'Klimczak R', 'Yu JH', 'Schaffer DV']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, 278 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-3220, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100628,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Integrases/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1001402107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1001402107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jul 13;107(28):12475-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1001402107.

IDH1 is mutated in up to 75% of grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas. Apart from acute myeloid leukaemia, other tumour types do not carry IDH1 mutations. Mutations in a homologous gene, IDH2, have also been identified, although they are much rarer. Although TP53 mutations and 1p/19q codeletions are mutually exclusive in gliomas, in both of these genotypes IDH1 mutations are common. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are early events in the development of gliomas. Moreover, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are a major prognostic marker for overall and progression-free survival in grade II-IV gliomas. Mutated IDH1 has an altered catalytic activity that results in the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate. Molecularly, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, affect only a single codon, and rarely occur together.

CFS has significant overlap with systemic hyperalgesia (fibromyalgia), autonomic dysfunction (irritable bowel syndrome and migraine headaches), sensory hypersensitivity (dyspnea; congestion; rhinorrhea; and appreciation of visceral nociception in the esophagus, gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and other organs), and central nervous system maladaptations (central sensitization) recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neurological dysfunction may account for the overlap of CFS with idiopathic nonallergic rhinopathy. Scientific advances are in fMRI, nociceptive sensor expression, and, potentially, infection with xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus provide additional insights to novel pathophysiological mechanisms of the ""functional"" complaints of these patients that are mistakenly interpreted as allergic syndromes.

Treatment with imatinib has demonstrated high response rates and improved prognosis for patients with CML. The emergence of imatinib resistance is a major concern. Dasatinib is an oral kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL that has been developed for treating CML patients across all phases of disease who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib versus high-dose imatinib treatment in chronic phase CML patients, resistant to lower doses of imatinib (< or =600 mg) in Sweden. METHODS AND DATA: A Markov simulation model was adapted to Swedish treatment practice. The model was populated with efficacy data from clinical trials, resource utilisation by expert opinion, published quality of life data and unit prices from official price lists. A life-long, societal perspective was used and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The results showed that chronic phase CML patients resistant to standard dose imatinib gain on average 0.67 life-years, or 0.62 quality adjusted life-years, when treated with dasatinib 140 mg/day compared with high-dose imatinib 800 mg/day. The incremental societal cost amounts to EUR 4 250 during the lifetime period, or EUR6880 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that dasatinib is a cost-effective treatment among imatinib-resistant CML patients in Sweden in comparison to imatinib 800 mg/daily.","['Ghatnekar, Ola', 'Hjalte, Frida', 'Taylor, Matthew']","['Ghatnekar O', 'Hjalte F', 'Taylor M']","['IHE, The Swedish Institute for Health Economics, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Sweden', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2010.495132 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2010 Aug;49(6):851-8. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2010.495132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In PML-RARalpha positive myeloid leukemia cells, ATO is known to cause degradation of PML-RARalpha with subsequent induced myeloid differentiation. We found that ATO by itself does not cause differentiation of the PML-RARalpha negative HL-60 cells, but enhances ATRA's capability to cause differentiation. ATO augmented ATRA-induced RAF/MEK/ERK axis signaling, expression of CD11b and p47(PHOX), and inducible oxidative metabolism. ATO enhanced ATRA-induced population growth retardation without evidence of apoptosis or enhanced G1/G0 growth arrest. Compared to ATRA-treated cells, the ATRA plus ATO-treated cells progressed more slowly through the cell cycle as detected by a slower rate of accumulation in G2/M following nocodazole treatment. Hoechst/PI staining showed that low-dose ATO did not induce apoptosis. In summary, our results indicate that ATO in conjunction with ATRA is of potential chemotherapeutic use in PML-RARalpha negative leukemias.","['Nayak, Satyaprakash', 'Shen, Miaoqing', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Bloom, Stephen E', 'Varner, Jeffrey D', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Nayak S', 'Shen M', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Bloom SE', 'Varner JD', 'Yen A']","['School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.501535 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Sep;51(9):1734-47. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.501535.,,,"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4896300,,,,['NIHMS790261'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews the use of intravenous rituximab in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), low-grade or follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The addition of rituximab to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide significantly prolonged progression-free survival both in previously untreated patients with CLL and in those with relapsed or refractory CLL, according to the results of two randomized, open-label, multicentre trials. In patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone [CHOP], cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone [CVP], mitoxantrone, chlorambucil and prednisolone, or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide and prednisolone) was generally associated with better outcomes than chemotherapy alone in randomized, multicentre trials. In a similarly designed trial, progression-free survival was significantly longer in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma, other indolent lymphomas or mantle-cell lymphoma who received rituximab plus bendamustine than in those receiving rituximab plus CHOP. Monotherapy with rituximab also demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular lymphoma, according to the results of noncomparative trials. In terms of maintenance therapy, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with rituximab maintenance therapy versus observation alone in patients with advanced indolent lymphoma who had not progressed following first-line therapy with CVP and in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who had responded to CHOP (with or without rituximab), according to the results of randomized, open-label, multicentre trials. In four randomized, open-label, multicentre trials in younger or elderly patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, event-free survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival were generally improved to a significant extent by the addition of rituximab to CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy. Intravenous rituximab was generally well tolerated in patients with CLL, low-grade or follicular lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, both as monotherapy and when administered in combination with chemotherapy. Infusion reactions were one of the most commonly occurring adverse events in patients receiving intravenous rituximab. The results of pharmacoeconomic modelling analyses demonstrated that rituximab appears to be cost effective in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, in patients with follicular lymphoma receiving rituximab maintenance therapy following treatment for relapsed or refractory disease and in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In conclusion, rituximab remains a valuable therapy in patients with CLL, low-grade or follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and, in a variety of treatment settings, represents the standard of care.","['Keating, Gillian M']",['Keating GM'],"['Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['8 [pii]', '10.2165/11201110-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2010 Jul 30;70(11):1445-76. doi: 10.2165/11201110-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['BioDrugs. 2011 Feb 1;25(1):55-61.

The oil was tested for its in vitro antileishmanial activity on two Leishmania strains, and its toxicity on the human monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell line and erythrocytes from sheep blood. The main constituents of the oil were benzyl benzoate (51.8%), linalool (10.1%), gamma-muurolene (9.3%), (E,E)-alpha-farnesene (3.2%), delta-cadinene (2.8%) and alpha-curcumene (2.7%).

We assessed renal and hepatic toxicity after imatinib and acetaminophen co-administration in a preclinical model.

The liver showed reversible cell damage like feathery degeneration, microvesicular fatty change, sinusoidal congestion and pyknosis, when imatinib or acetaminophen were administered separately. The damage increased gradually with time, peaked at 2 h but resolved by 4 h. When both drugs were administered concurrently, the liver showed irreversible damage (cytolysis, karyolysis and karyorrhexis) which did not resolve by 6 h. Very minor renal changes were observed. Acetaminophen and imatinib co-administration increased hepatoxicity which become irreversible, probably due to shared P450 biotransformation pathways and transporters in the liver.","['Nassar, Inthisham', 'Pasupati, Thanikachalam', 'Judson, John Paul', 'Segarra, Ignacio']","['Nassar I', 'Pasupati T', 'Judson JP', 'Segarra I']","['Department of Pathology, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Analgesics/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Interactions', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kidney/*drug effects/pathology', 'Liver/*drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Piperazines/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/07/10 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2010 Jun;32(1):1-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20614628,,Publisher,,,,,,2008,Immunologic targeting of the cancer stem cell,,,"Growing evidence has suggested that lack of eradication of the malignant stem cell forms the basis for cancer relapse and progression. In this regard, the clinical experiences of treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a prototypical stem cell disease, have been instructive, and are illustrative of the challenges facing the treatment of cancer when using potent cytoreductive agents that incompletely eradicate minimal residual disease. On the other hand, several decades of clinical and laboratory experience have demonstrated the curative potential of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for CML and other hematologic malignancies. As reviewed in this chapter, these studies have clearly demonstrated the curative potential of immune-based recognition of tumor cells, including the malignant progenitor cell population. These data set the stage for newer approaches that focus on immune targeting of antigens that are present on the cancer stem cell. Rational immune targeting of the tumor-initiating population critically depends on (1) identifying the unique surface markers of these cells so that they may be isolated, and on (2) defining antigens that are uniquely or preferentially expressed within the malignant cells with stem-cell like functions compared to normal cells. While debate continues as to the exact nature and defining characteristics of the cell population that is capable of propagating tumor, and hence the critical tumor cell sub-population that is required for immune targeting, several promising approaches for cancer immunotherapy are under investigation. Ultimately, combination therapy that includes both pharmacologic cytoreductive agents together with immunologic targeting of malignant stem cell populations may provide an effective curative approach with acceptable toxicity for the treatment of malignant diseases.","['Wu, Catherine J']",['Wu CJ'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Cambridge (MA),,,,,,,2010/07/09 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,,,"['NBK27075 [bookaccession]', '10.3824/stembook.1.21.1 [doi]']",,,,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2008 Catherine J.

THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Familial monosomy 7 is characterized by early-childhood onset of bone marrow insufficiency/failure associated with increased risk for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In all reported individuals, the monosomy 7 is believed to be an acquired cytogenetic abnormality within hematopoietic cells due to as-yet poorly defined inherited genetic predisposition. Identification of peripheral blood leukocytes with monosomy 7 usually precedes bone marrow failure/MDS/AML by a few months to years. Nearly all individuals reported with familial monosomy 7 have died of their disease. Note: Only a minority of individuals with bone marrow failure/MDS/AML with monosomy 7 have familial monosomy 7. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Detection of cells with monosomy 7 during evaluation of a hematologic abnormality or malignancy or in the context of chromosomal studies in the diagnosis of unrelated conditions needs to be confirmed with bone marrow cytogenetic and interphase FISH studies. A bone marrow karyotype of 45,XX,-7 in females or 45,XY,-7 in males, often mosaic with normal cells (i.e., 46,XX in females and 46,XY in males), confirms the presence of monosomy 7. Of note, individuals with a family history of monosomy 7 (e.g., an affected sib) may initially have a normal karyotype in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow and later transition to mosaic monosomy 7 in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Urgent referral to an oncologist should be considered for individuals with monosomy 7 (mosaic or non-mosaic). Definitive therapy is bone marrow transplantation (BMT) prior to the emergence of a leukemic clone. The suitability of sibs who are potential bone marrow donors may be evaluated with appropriate hematologic and cytogenetic studies to rule out bone marrow disease associated with familial monosomy 7. However, given that the underlying germline pathogenic variant may not be known, a matched sib donor may not be an ideal candidate (unless much older than the affected individual and with no evidence of hematologic disorders). An unrelated donor may be more suitable. Prevention of secondary complications: It is unknown if the standard protocols for ablative therapy prior to BMT should be modified. Surveillance: Annual monitoring of peripheral blood karyotype, hematologic status, and hemoglobin F levels helps identify emerging bone marrow abnormalities (cytopenias and bone marrow dysplasia) prior to the development of overt AML or MDS. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In both children and adults with a family history of monosomy 7, otherwise unexplained signs and symptoms should be evaluated by a physician as possible early indications of the disorder. GENETIC COUNSELING: The mode of inheritance of familial monosomy 7 is unknown.","['Morrissette, Jennifer JD', 'Wertheim, Gerald', 'Olson, Timothy']","['Morrissette JJD', 'Wertheim G', 'Olson T']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Seattle (WA),,,,,,,2016/01/21 06:00,2016/01/21 06:00,,,['NBK45015 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

Nutritional support aims to reverse malnutrition seen at diagnosis, prevent malnutrition associated with treatment and promote weight gain and growth. The most effective and safe forms of nutritional support in children and young people with cancer are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of any form of parenteral (PN) or enteral (EN) nutritional support in children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CINAHL (1982 to 2006), the National Research Register (2007) and Dissertations & Theses (2007). We scrutinised reference lists of articles to identify additional trials. We also contacted experts in the field for information on relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any form of nutritional support with another, or control, in children or young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials. Three authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted trialists for missing information. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight trials which randomised 159 participants (< 21 years) with leukaemias or solid tumours undergoing chemotherapy. The trials were all of low quality. One small trial found that compared to EN, PN significantly increased weight (mean difference (MD) 4.12; 95% CI 1.91 to 6.33), serum albumin levels (MD 0.70; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.26), calorie intake (MD 22.00; 95% CI 5.12 to 38.88) and protein intake (MD 0.80; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.15). One trial comparing peripheral PN and EN with central PN found that mean daily weight gain (MD -27.00; 95% CI -43.32 to -10.68) and energy intakes (MD -15.00; 95% CI -26.81 to -3.19) were significantly less for the peripheral PN and EN group, whereas mean change in serum albumin was significantly greater for that group(MD 0.47; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81, P = 0.008). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence from individual trials to suggest that parenteral nutrition is more effective than enteral nutrition in well-nourished children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The evidence for other methods of nutritional support remains unclear. No studies were identified comparing the nutritional content in the PN or EN groups of studies. Further research, incorporating larger sample sizes and rigorous methodology utilising valid and reliable outcome measures, is essential.","['Jones, Leanne', 'Watling, Ruth M', 'Wilkins, Simone', 'Pizer, Barry']","['Jones L', 'Watling RM', 'Wilkins S', 'Pizer B']","[""Evidence Based Child Health Unit, Institute of Child Health, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Alderhey, Eaton Road, Liverpool, UK, L12 2AP.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20100707,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Enteral Nutrition/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Malnutrition/etiology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Parenteral Nutrition/*methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/08/12 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD003298.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010 Jul 7;(7):CD003298. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD003298.pub2.,,,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015;8:CD003298.

As shown in other cancer settings, an underlying condition of activation of the coagulation system leading to a prothrombotic state of chronic or subclinical DIC is detectable. A variety of disease- or treatment-related factors may affect this condition, enhancing the risk of thrombosis or of bleeding and further triggering mechanisms of DIC in this setting. An overt DIC is diagnosed in approximately 15% of patients with acute leukemia, and bleeding manifestations prevail over thrombosis, with the highest and most harmful clinical impact in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Pathogenic mechanisms include a series of intrinsic properties of malignant cells, able to directly activate the coagulation system or to stimulate prothrombotic effects by the host cells.

XIAP is the most potent among them and is over-expressed in several hematological malignancies. Its activity is endogenously antagonized by SMAC/DIABLO, and also by small molecules mimicking Smac that can induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Here we describe the activity of 56 newly synthesized Smac-mimetics in human leukemic cell lines and normal CD34(+) progenitor cells. Our compounds bind to XIAP with high affinity, reduce the levels of cIAP1 and are cytotoxic at nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, the Smac-mimetics synergize with Cytarabine, Etoposide and especially with TRAIL in combination treatments. Apoptosis activation was clearly detectable by the occurrence of sub G(1) apoptotic peak and the accumulation of cleaved PARP, caspase 8 and caspase 3. Interestingly, the down-regulation of XIAP sensitized Jurkat cells to drugs too, confirming the role of this protein in drug-resistance. In conclusion, while being very active in leukemic cells, our Smac-mimetics have modest effects on normal hematopoietic progenitors, suggesting their promising therapeutic potential as a new class of anticancer drugs in onco-hematology, particularly when combined with TRAIL, to overcome the resistance of cancer cells.","['Servida, Federica', 'Lecis, Daniele', 'Scavullo, Cinzia', 'Drago, Carmelo', 'Seneci, Pierfausto', 'Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Manzoni, Leonardo', 'Polli, Elio', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Delia, Domenico', 'Onida, Francesco']","['Servida F', 'Lecis D', 'Scavullo C', 'Drago C', 'Seneci P', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Manzoni L', 'Polli E', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Delia D', 'Onida F']","['Fondazione Matarelli, Dipartimento di Farmacologia Chemioterapia e Tossicologia Medica, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Via Vanvitelli 32, 20129, Milan, Italy. fservida@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100708,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",2010/07/09 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9475-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2011 Dec;29(6):1264-75. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9475-6.

Oral problems resulting from cancer therapy increase the risk of infection, length of hospital stay, treatment cost and negative impact on the course and prognosis of the disease. METHOD: Of the 367 medical records of cancer patients seen from November 2007 until December 2008: 186 with a cancer diagnosis and complete clinical data were selected, while 20 with a cancer diagnosis and incomplete records were excluded; 161 medical records with only hematological diagnosis were also excluded. The following characteristics were assessed: ethnicity, gender, age, diagnosis and characteristics of the neoplasm, cancer therapy status and performed dental procedures. RESULTS: Review of 1,236 visits indicated that 54% (n=100) of the patients had blood cancers, 46% (n=86) had solid tumors and 63% were undergoing anticancer therapy. The proportion of males (52.7%) in the study population was slightly greater. The most common cancer was acute lymphocytic leukemia (32.2%). Cancer occurred more often among those patients aged 5 to 9 years. The most common dental procedures were restorative treatment, preventive treatment and removal of infectious foci. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the studied population were similar to those of the general Brazilian and global populations, especially regarding gender and diagnosis distributions. The aim of implementation of the dentistry unit was to maintain good oral health and patients' quality of life, which is critical to provide oral care and prevent future oral problems.","['Carrillo, Camila', 'Vizeu, Heloisa', 'Soares-Junior, Luis Alberto', 'Fava, Marcelo', 'Filho, Vicente Odone']","['Carrillo C', 'Vizeu H', 'Soares-Junior LA', 'Fava M', 'Filho VO']","['Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Dental Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Teaching/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Oncology Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Stomatognathic Diseases/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/09 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1590/S1807-59322010000600002 [doi]', 'S1807-59322010000600002 [pii]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2010 Jun;65(6):569-73. doi: 10.1590/S1807-59322010000600002.,,,,PMC2898549,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Dental care', 'Outpatient care', 'Pediatric dentistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased apoptosis and suppressed functions of peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells have been described in MDS patients, but only limited information is available on the phenotypic and functional integrity of NK cells in the bone marrow. In a cohort of 41 patients with distinct clinical subtypes of MDS, we here show that NK cells in the bone marrow show decreased surface expression of the activating receptors DNAM-1 and NKG2D. Notably, decreased receptor expression correlated with elevated bone marrow blast counts and was associated with impaired NK-cell responsiveness to stimulation with the K562 cell line, or co-activation by NKG2D or DNAM-1 in combination with the 2B4 receptor. Furthermore, antibody-masking experiments revealed a central role for DNAM-1 in NK cell-mediated killing of freshly isolated MDS blasts. Thus, given the emerging evidence for NK cell-mediated immune surveillance of neoplastic cells, we speculate that reduced expression of DNAM-1 on bone marrow NK cells may facilitate disease progression in patients with MDS.","['Carlsten, M', 'Baumann, B C', 'Simonsson, M', 'Jadersten, M', 'Forsblom, A-M', 'Hammarstedt, C', 'Bryceson, Y T', 'Ljunggren, H-G', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Malmberg, K-J']","['Carlsten M', 'Baumann BC', 'Simonsson M', 'Jadersten M', 'Forsblom AM', 'Hammarstedt C', 'Bryceson YT', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Malmberg KJ']","['Department of Medicine, Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. mattias.carlsten@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100708,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD226 antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010149 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.149 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1607-16. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.149.

LMP-420-induced time- and dose-dependent apoptosis, as shown by annexin V staining, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. These changes were associated with decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. CLL cells from patients with poor prognostic indicators showed LMP-420 sensitivity equal to that for cells from patients with favorable characteristics. In addition, LMP-420 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of fludarabine and inhibited in vitro proliferation of stimulated CLL cells. Gene expression profiling indicated that the mechanism of action of LMP-420 may involve suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB and immune response pathways in CLL cells. LMP-420 had minimal effects on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell, B- and T-cell function, and hematopoietic colony formation.

A 100-day cost-effectiveness model was developed following the Italian hospital perspective. The probability of IFIs, death from IFIs, and death from other causes was obtained from the literature. Health care sector resources (type, volume, unit cost) are given in Euros and refer to 2009. The robustness of the cost-effectiveness model was tested via one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Total costs for posaconazole (standard azoles) was estimated at Euros 3365.26 (Euros 2339.96). Posaconazole is consistently more effective than standard azoles.

The C-terminal ILLHPWF motif that is well conserved among Trib family proteins is required for MEK1 binding, enhancement of ERK phosphorylation, enhanced self-renewal activity of bone marrow cells and leukemogenic activity by Trib1. The motif is also important for Trib1-induced C/EBPalpha degradation though interaction between Trib1 and C/EBPalpha is not necessary. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation suppressed Trib1-induced C/EBPalpha degradation, indicating an important role for Trib1/MEK1 interaction.

Rituximab, a CD20 antibody, is currently widely used in combination-based strategies for both previously untreated symptomatic CLL and as salvage therapy. Recent data suggest that the addition of rituximab to fludarabine with or without cyclophosphamide prolongs survival in younger patients with CLL. Other improved CD20 antibodies with promising clinical activity, including ofatumumab and GA-101, are coming forward. Alemtuzumab, a CD52 antibody, likewise has demonstrated benefit in both symptomatic, previously untreated CLL and in patients with relapsed disease but has less selectivity. Development of other therapeutic antibodies targeting alternative B-cell-specific antigens in CLL has been less successful, although many promising candidate antibodies and/or small modular immune pharmaceuticals (SMIPs) are coming forward. In addition, recent efforts to combine currently applied therapeutic antibodies with other biologic and targeted therapies with efficacy in CLL offers the potential to move toward alternative non-chemotherapy-based treatment approaches.","['Jaglowski, Samantha M', 'Alinari, Lapo', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Jaglowski SM', 'Alinari L', 'Lapalombella R', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100707,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology/therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Models, Immunological', 'Rituximab']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31092-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-001230 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Nov 11;116(19):3705-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-001230.

Eleven African lions (9 male and 2 female) with clinical signs and gross and microscopic lesions of malignant lymphoma were evaluated in this study. All animals were older adults, ranging in age from 14 to 19 years. Immunohistochemically, 10 of the 11 lions had T-cell lymphomas (CD3(+), CD79a(-)), and 1 lion was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoma (CD3(-), CD79a(+)). The spleen appeared to be the primary site of neoplastic growth in all T-cell lymphomas, with involvement of the liver (6/11) and regional lymph nodes (5/11) also commonly observed. The B-cell lymphoma affected the peripheral lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. According to the current veterinary and human World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic neoplasms, T-cell lymphoma subtypes included peripheral T-cell lymphoma (4/11), precursor (acute) T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (2/11), chronic T-cell lymphocytic lymphoma/leukemia (3/11), and T-zone lymphoma (1/11). The single B-cell lymphoma subtype was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) testing by immunohistochemistry on sections of malignant lymphoma was negative for all 11 lions. One lion was seropositive for FeLV. In contrast to domestic and exotic cats, in which B-cell lymphomas are more common than T-cell lymphomas, African lions in this study had malignant lymphomas that were primarily of T-cell origin.

This suggested that the mobilization of adaptive immunity by administered MAbs is key for the success in the long term for the MAb-based passive immunotherapy of chronic viral infections. We have addressed here whether the anti-FrCas(E) protective endogenous immunity is the mere consequence of viral propagation blunting, which would simply give time to the immune system to react, and/or to actual immunomodulation by the MAb during the treatment. To this aim, we have compared viral replication, disease progression, and antiviral immune responses between different groups of infected mice: (i) mice treated with either the 667 MAb, its F(ab')(2) fragment, or an IgM (672) with epitopic specificity similar to that of 667 but displaying different effector functions, and (ii) mice receiving no treatment but infected with a low viral inoculum reproducing the initial viral expansion observed in their infected/667 MAb-treated counterparts. Our data show that the reduction of FrCas(E) propagation is insufficient on its own to induce protective immunity and support a direct immunomodulatory action of the 667 MAb. Interestingly, they also point to sequential actions of the administered MAb. In a first step, viral propagation is exclusively controlled by 667 neutralizing activity, and in a second one, this action is complemented by FcgammaR-binding-dependent mechanisms, which most likely combine infected cell cytolysis and the modulation of the antiviral endogenous immune response. Such complementary effects of administered MAbs must be taken into consideration for the improvement of future antiviral MAb-based immunotherapies.","['Nasser, Roudaina', 'Pelegrin, Mireia', 'Michaud, Henri-Alexandre', 'Plays, Marc', 'Piechaczyk, Marc', 'Gros, Laurent']","['Nasser R', 'Pelegrin M', 'Michaud HA', 'Plays M', 'Piechaczyk M', 'Gros L']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, UMR 5535 CNRS, 1919 Route de Mende, 34293, Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100707,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Antibodies, Viral/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00568-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00568-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Oct;84(19):10169-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00568-10.

In humans, B. henselae infection can result in self-limiting cat scratch disease. However, immunocompromised patients may suffer from more-severe courses of infection or may even develop the potentially lethal disease bacillary angiomatosis. It was reasoned that cats with immunocompromising viral infections may react similarly to B. henselae infection. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of the most important viruses known to cause immunosuppression in cats-Feline leukemia virus (FeLV), Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV)-on natural B. henselae infection in cats. Accordingly, 142 cats from animal shelters were necropsied and tested for B. henselae and concurrent infections with FeLV, FIV, or FPV by PCR and immunohistochemistry. A significant association was found between B. henselae and FeLV infections (P = 0.00028), but not between B. henselae and FIV (P = 1.0) or FPV (P = 0.756) infection, age (P = 0.392), or gender (P = 0.126). The results suggest that susceptibility to B. henselae infection is higher in cats with concurrent FeLV infections, regardless of whether the infection is latent or progressive. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry for B. henselae failed to identify lesions that could be attributed specifically to B. henselae infection.

However, its mechanism of heme export and substrate specificity are uncharacterized. Using [(55)Fe]heme and the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin, we investigated whether export by FLVCR depends on the availability and avidity of extracellular heme-binding proteins. Export was 100-fold more efficient when the medium contained hemopexin (K(d) < 1 pm) compared with albumin (K(d) = 5 nm) at the same concentration and was not detectable when the medium lacked heme-binding proteins. Besides heme, FLVCR could export other cyclic planar porphyrins, such as protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin. However, FLVCR has a narrow substrate range because unconjugated bilirubin, the primary breakdown product of heme, was not transported. As neither protoporphyrin IX nor coproporphyrin export improved with extracellular hemopexin (versus albumin), our observations further suggest that hemopexin, an abundant protein with a serum concentration (6.7-25 mum) equivalent to that of the iron transport protein transferrin (22-31 mum), by accepting heme from FLVCR and targeting it to the liver, might regulate macrophage heme export and heme iron recycling in vivo. Final studies show that hemopexin directly interacts with FLVCR, which also helps explain why FLVCR, in contrast to some major facilitator superfamily members, does not function as a bidirectional gradient-dependent transporter. Together, these data argue that hemopexin has a role in assuring systemic iron balance during homeostasis in addition to its established role as a scavenger during internal bleeding or hemolysis.","['Yang, Zhantao', 'Philips, John D', 'Doty, Raymond T', 'Giraudi, Pablo', 'Ostrow, J Donald', 'Tiribelli, Claudio', 'Smith, Ann', 'Abkowitz, Janis L']","['Yang Z', 'Philips JD', 'Doty RT', 'Giraudi P', 'Ostrow JD', 'Tiribelli C', 'Smith A', 'Abkowitz JL']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100707,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Coproporphyrins)', '0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9013-71-2 (Hemopexin)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Coproporphyrins/genetics/metabolism', 'Heme/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hemolysis/genetics', 'Hemopexin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hemorrhage/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protoporphyrins/genetics/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/genetics/metabolism']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)52740-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.119131 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Sep 10;285(37):28874-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.119131.

Although a sequential transformation from low-grade gastric MALToma (GM) to high-grade GM to secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is commonly assumed, documented cases of transformation are rare. We aim to determine the frequency of transformation. METHODS: We identified 55 early low-grade GMs, 18 early high-grade GMs, and 13 advanced GMs at the National Taiwan University Hospital from 1995 to 2005. The median follow-up time was 59 months. RESULTS: We found that only one early low-grade GM and two early high-grade GMs transformed into secondary DLBCLs and progressed outside the stomach and regional lymph nodes. Significantly, we identified 13 low-grade GMs that were refractory to Helicobacter eradication therapy or relapsed after initial response. All 13 cases had been followed-up for at least 3 years without development of secondary DLBCLs. The frequency of transformation for early low-grade GM was less than 2% (1/55). Although two lymphoma-unrelated mortalities were identified, none of the 55 patients with early-low grade GMs died of the disease. CONCLUSION: Compared with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a 16% transformation rate and a median transformation time of 24 months, we conclude that early low-grade GM rarely transforms into secondary DLBCL or progresses beyond the stomach. Without transformation or progression, patients with early low-grade GM rarely die of the disease and should be treated conservatively.","['Liu, Ting-Yun', 'Dei, Pei-Han', 'Kuo, Sung-Hsin', 'Lin, Chung-Wu']","['Liu TY', 'Dei PH', 'Kuo SH', 'Lin CW']","['Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastric Mucosa/*pathology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2009/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0929-6646(10)60078-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-6646(10)60078-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2010 Jun;109(6):463-71. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(10)60078-2.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

It is unknown if these patients are at higher risk of dying from pulmonary resection due to lymphoma or if they have reasonable long-term survival. METHODS: We identified 47 lymphoma patients, seven of which had active lymphoma and forty with a history of lymphoma, who underwent resection for lung cancer between 1998 and 2008. We matched lymphoma patients with lung cancer patients who had no lymphoma based on age, gender, surgery type, comorbidities, stage, and histology. We analyzed differences in the length of hospitalization, morbidity, mortality, and overall and lung cancer specific survival between the lymphoma group and the matched no lymphoma group. RESULTS: We found no significant difference in length of hospitalization, morbidity, or mortality between the lymphoma and matched no lymphoma group. The lymphoma group's 5-year overall survival rate (35%) was significantly lower than that of the no lymphoma group (67%; p = 0.04). However, the difference in lung cancer-specific survival between the groups was not significant. The cause-of-death analysis revealed that lymphoma patients also died from recurrent lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myeloid leukemia. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, higher stage, and active lymphoma status were significant adverse predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant increase in operative morbidity and mortality for lymphoma patients having pulmonary resection for lung cancer. The survival for lymphoma patients is decreased but still acceptable with no difference in lung cancer-specific survival.","['Kim, Min P', 'Correa, Arlene M', 'Swisher, Stephen G', 'Hofstetter, Wayne L', 'Mehran, Reza J', 'Rice, David C', 'Walsh, Garrett L', 'Erasmus, Jeremy Jr', 'Moran, Cesar', 'Vaporciyan, Ara A', 'Roth, Jack A']","['Kim MP', 'Correa AM', 'Swisher SG', 'Hofstetter WL', 'Mehran RJ', 'Rice DC', 'Walsh GL', 'Erasmus J Jr', 'Moran C', 'Vaporciyan AA', 'Roth JA']","['Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: The MMN and P3a to phonetic stimuli were examined in 27 childhood cancer patients with age- and sex-matched controls. Neuropsychological tests were also studied. RESULTS: The MMN peak amplitude was attenuated in the patient group at Study 1. Between the studies, poorer enhancement of the MMN peak amplitude correlated with deterioration in the Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) in leukaemia patients. In addition, prolongation of the MMN peak latency correlated significantly with deterioration in the Full Scale and Performance IQ in the patient group. Deterioration in the Arithmetic subtest and Performance IQ correlated negatively with the age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The MMN changes between the studies associated with deterioration in the neuropsychological tests indicating that the method could be clinically useful. The performance of the younger patients was more likely to deteriorate during the treatment.

However, how As(2)O(3) initiates PML sumoylation has remained largely unexplained. As(2)O(3) binds vicinal cysteines and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We demonstrate that upon As(2)O(3) exposure, PML undergoes ROS-initiated intermolecular disulfide formation and binds arsenic directly. Disulfide-linked PML or PML/RARA multimers form nuclear matrix-associated nuclear bodies (NBs), become sumoylated and are degraded. Hematopoietic progenitors transformed by an As(2)O(3)-binding PML/RARA mutant exhibit defective As(2)O(3) response. Conversely, nonarsenical oxidants elicit PML/RARA multimerization, NB-association, degradation, and leukemia response in vivo, but do not affect PLZF/RARA-driven APLs. Thus, PML oxidation regulates NB-biogenesis, while oxidation-enforced PML/RARA multimerization and direct arsenic-binding cooperate to enforce APL's exquisite As(2)O(3) sensitivity.","['Jeanne, Marion', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie', 'Ferhi, Omar', 'Koken, Marcel', 'Le Bras, Morgane', 'Duffort, Stephanie', 'Peres, Laurent', 'Berthier, Caroline', 'Soilihi, Hassane', 'Raught, Brian', 'de The, Hugues']","['Jeanne M', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Ferhi O', 'Koken M', 'Le Bras M', 'Duffort S', 'Peres L', 'Berthier C', 'Soilihi H', 'Raught B', 'de The H']","['Inserm/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)/Universite Paris Diderot/Institut Universitaire Hematologie U944/UMR7212, Laboratoire associe de la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Hopital St Louis, 1, Av.

To identify genes whose inhibition sensitizes Bcr-Abl(+) leukemias to killing by Bcr-Abl inhibitors, we performed an RNAi-based synthetic lethal screen with imatinib mesylate in CML cells. This screen identified numerous components of a Wnt/Ca(2+)/NFAT signaling pathway. Antagonism of this pathway led to impaired NFAT activity, decreased cytokine production, and enhanced sensitivity to Bcr-Abl inhibition. Furthermore, NFAT inhibition with cyclosporin A facilitated leukemia cell elimination by the Bcr-Abl inhibitor dasatinib and markedly improved survival in a mouse model of Bcr-Abl(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Data quality is crucial but difficult to measure objectively. We assessed agreement between incident cancer reported to the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) and to the Central Cancer Registry (CCR) in New South Wales. METHODS: ANZDATA records were linked to CCR using probabilistic matching. We calculated agreement between registries for patients with > or =1 cancers, all cancers and site-specific cancer using the kappa statistic (kappa). We investigated cases where records disagreed and compared estimates of cancer risk based either on ANZDATA or on CCR using standardized incidence ratios (indirect standardization by age, sex and calendar year). RESULTS: From 1980 to 2001, 9453 residents had dialysis or transplantation. ANZDATA recorded 867 cancers in 779 (8.2%) registrants; CCR 867 cancers in 788 (8.3%). ANZDATA recorded 170 patients with cancer that CCR did not, CCR recorded 179 patients that ANZDATA did not (kappa = 0.76). ANZDATA had sensitivity 77.3% (confidence interval (CI) 74.2-80.2), specificity 98.1% (CI 97.7-98.3) if CCR records were regarded as the reference standard. Agreement was similar for diagnoses while receiving dialysis (kappa = 0.78) or after transplantation (kappa = 0.79), but varied by cancer type. Agreement was poorest for melanoma (kappa = 0.61) and myeloma (kappa = 0.47) and highest for lymphoma (kappa = 0.80), leukaemia (kappa = 0.86) and breast cancer (kappa = 0.85). Artefact accounted for 20.8% of the non-concordance but error and misclassification did occur in both registries. Estimates of cancer risk based on ANZDATA or CCR records did not differ in any important way. CONCLUSION: Agreement of cancer records between both registries was high and differences largely explicable. It is likely that both ANZDATA and CCR have some inaccuracies, for reasons that are now more explicit, with themes similar to those likely to be experienced by other registries.","['Webster, Angela C', 'Supramaniam, Rajah', ""O'Connell, Dianne L"", 'Chapman, Jeremy R', 'Craig, Jonathan C']","['Webster AC', 'Supramaniam R', ""O'Connell DL"", 'Chapman JR', 'Craig JC']","['School of Public Health, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. angela.webster@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,Australia,Nephrology (Carlton),"Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",9615568,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Data Collection', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', '*Mandatory Reporting', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Renal Dialysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/10/27 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['NEP1297 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1797.2010.01297.x [doi]']",ppublish,Nephrology (Carlton). 2010 Jun;15(4):491-501. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1797.2010.01297.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to clarify prognostic implications of PK factors in CML patients treated with imatinib. The plasma trough (C(min)) level of imatinib and serum alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) level were measured on two different days in 65 CML patients treated with imatinib for more than 12 months. We further examined whether the C(min) level of imatinib actually reflects inhibitory activity against BCR-ABL kinase using the plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay. Since the differences of five patients were statistically rejected by the Smirnov-Grubbs' test, we excluded them for further analysis. The C(min) level was strongly associated with the achievement of MMR at the 12th month, and ROC analysis demonstrated C(min) levels and their discrimination potential for major molecular response (MMR) with the best sensitivity (63.2%) and specificity (68.2%) at a C(min) threshold of 974 ng/mL. The alpha(1)-Acid glycoprotein (AGP) level was within the normal range in 57 of 60 patients, indicating little impact of AGP on our study. There was a weak correlation between PIA against phospho (P)-BCR-ABL and the C(min) level of imatinib (r(2) = 0.2501, P = 0.0007), and patient plasma containing >974 ng/mL imatinib sufficiently inhibited P-BCR-ABL. These results collectively indicated that maintaining approximately 1000 ng/mL of C(min) was clinically and biologically important for the optimal response in CML patients treated with imatinib. A prospective intervention study is required to establish PK-based management in CML patients treated with imatinib.","['Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Watanabe, Keisuke', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Nakano, Yasuyuki', 'Kitamura, Kunio', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Sugiura, Isamu', 'Yokozawa, Toshiya', 'Hanamura, Akitoshi', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Iida, Hiroatsu', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Ishikawa Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Watanabe K', 'Miyamura K', 'Nakano Y', 'Kitamura K', 'Kohno A', 'Sugiura I', 'Yokozawa T', 'Hanamura A', 'Yamamoto K', 'Iida H', 'Emi N', 'Suzuki R', 'Ohnishi K', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100701,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Orosomucoid/analysis', 'Piperazines/*blood/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*blood/*pharmacology']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1643 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01643.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Oct;101(10):2186-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01643.x.

In this study, we used an ALV J molecular clone, ADOL pR5-4, to determine the role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) escape mutants in maintaining a high incidence of viral persistence, namely, V+A+ infection profile in commercial meat-type chickens. Chickens were housed as a flock in a pen or housed in isolation in solitary Horsfall-Bauer units for testing for NAb escape variants. The emergence of NAb escape variants was evaluated by sequential autologous virus neutralization (VN) (between virus and antibody from the same sampling period) and heterologous VN (between virus and antibody from preceding and succeeding sampling periods). Sequential virus isolates and corresponding antisera from 18 chickens were examined by VN matrix. In all chickens, autologous virus isolates were not neutralized by corresponding antisera. However, some of these resilient autologous virus isolates were neutralized by antibodies from subsequent sampling intervals. Nucleotide sequence analysis of consecutive isolates from three individually housed chickens with V+A+ infection profile revealed distinct changes within the envelope region, suggesting viral evolution to escape the host immune response.

We experimented with a staged therapeutic protocol forthis condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17 patients, aged from 27 to 71 (mean age 43) were treated for ischemic priapism; the pathogenesis was idiopathic in 9 cases, in 4 cases secondary to intracavernous injection (IcI) of PGE1, in 2 cases to papaverine Icd, in 1 case to haemolympho-pathy and in another patient to treatement with heparin. Cavernous PO2, PCO2 and pH were checked. All patients underwent removal of 100 cc of blood, irrigation with NaHCO3 solution of the cavernous corpora and Methylen blue (MB) IcI 10 mg every 5 minutes 10 times, repeated twice. RESULTS: From 3 to 6 hours from the beginning of therapy, detumescence was achieved in 10 cases. In 5 cases the priapism persisted and we administered adrenaline 20 pg every 5-10 minutes: 2 cases had detumescence respectively in 5 and 7 hours whereas in the patient with leukaemia the erection persisted and we desisted from further therapy; in 2 other cases the erection persisted and we did a distal cavernosum-glans shunt and the detumescence a was achieved in 30 and 58 hours respectively. In the last 2 cases, before adrenaline we administered an IcI of ethylephrine 5 mg every 5 minutes for 4-5 times but finally we had to perform a shunt. In all cases, during the treatment, and during the following 6-8 hours, we administered 200 mg of MB intravenous. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of oral drugs has changed the epidemiology of priapism. A better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern the cavernous contraction and myorelaxation has allowed us to use adrenergic drugs and also the MB. This staged therapeutic protocol goes from a less invasive therapy (irrigation with NaHCO3, MB, ethylephrine, adrenaline) to a surgical procedure which must not be delayed and this progression could allow a reduction in the collateral effects.","['Passavanti, Giandomenico', 'Bragaglia, Alessandro', 'Paolini, Riccardo']","['Passavanti G', 'Bragaglia A', 'Paolini R']","['Department of Urology Misericordia Hospital, Grosseto, Italy. mpeppina@infinito.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Arch Ital Urol Androl,"Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",9308247,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', '8MDF5V39QO (Sodium Bicarbonate)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)', 'ZB6F8MY53V (Etilefrine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Epinephrine/therapeutic use', 'Etilefrine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Priapism/*drug therapy/etiology/*surgery', '*Prostatectomy/methods', 'Sodium Bicarbonate/therapeutic use', 'Therapeutic Irrigation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Arch Ital Urol Androl. 2009 Dec;81(4):242-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib induces complete haematological and cytogenetic response in high percentage of patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify potential prognostic factors before beginning treatment with imatinib associated with complete cytogenetic response. METHODS: We analyzed 20 patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive chronic myelogenous leukemia treated at our institution from June 2006 until May 2009. These patients were treated with imatinib mesylate in oral dose of 400 to 800 mg daily. Complete blood counts were performed every month, while serum chemistry evaluations and bone marrow evaluations including morphology and cytogenetics were performed every 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients analyzed in this study, 19 (95%) achieved complete haematologic response within three months. In all patients cytogenetic analyses were done and all have achieved absolute cytogenetic response. The best cytogenetic response rate at any time during study treatment among 20 patients was: complete cytogenetic response in 15, partial cytogenetic response in three and minor cytogenetic response in two patients. Among 11 observed base-line patients' characteristics five were independent predictors of a high rate of complete cytogenetic response; the absence of blasts and basophils in peripheral blood, the presence of less than 5 percent of bone marrow blasts, white blood cell count less than 10 x 10(9)/L and the absence of splenomegaly (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that some pre-treatment characteristics of patients might be the cause of differences in treatment outcome. On the basis of this analysis, we identified several pre-treatment patients' characteristics to be independent prognostic factors for achievement of complete cytogenetic response.","['Cojbasic, Irena', 'Macukanovic-Golubovic, Lana']","['Cojbasic I', 'Macukanovic-Golubovic L']","['Clinical Centre, Clinic of Haematology and Clinical Immunology, Nis, Serbia. icojbasic@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/09 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/sarh1006305c [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2010 May-Jun;138(5-6):305-8. doi: 10.2298/sarh1006305c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 79/205 patients (38.5%), at least one KD mutation was detected; in 13/79 (16.5%) even two different mutations were observed.

In this study, an identical reciprocal translocation, t(11;16)(q13;p13), was identified in three chondroid lipomas, a finding consistent with previously isolated reports. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based positional cloning strategy using a series of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe combinations designed to narrow the 16p13 breakpoint revealed MKL2 as the candidate gene. Subsequent 5' RACE studies demonstrated C11orf95 as the MKL2 fusion gene partner. MKL/myocardin-like 2 (MKL2) encodes myocardin-related transcription factor B in a megakaryoblastic leukemia gene family, and C11orf95 (chromosome 11 open reading frame 95) is a hypothetical protein. Sequencing analysis of reverse transcription-polymerse chain reaction (RT-PCR) generated transcripts from all three chondroid lipomas defined the fusion as occurring between exons 5 and 9 of C11orf95 and MKL2, respectively. Dual-color breakpoint spanning probe sets custom-designed for recognition of the translocation event in interphase cells confirmed the anticipated rearrangements of the C11orf95 and MKL2 loci in all cases.

Neural tumors are, for example, gliomas of the optic nerve and in 25-50% of cases are associated with neurofibromatosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rapidly growing malignant orbital tumor whereby the stage and localization are the most important prognostic factors for survival chance in children. Leukemia can be associated with a chloroma especially in the first decade of life. Lymphoproliferative diseases, vascular and cystic tumors in particular are known as tumors of adulthood. In addition to fibroosseous and mesenchymal tumors, neural forms, such as schwannomas are also important.

HYPOTHESIS: Traffic exhaust in the air enhances the risk association between radon and childhood leukemia. METHODS: We included 985 cases of childhood leukemia and 1,969 control children. We used validated models to calculate residential radon and street NO(x) concentrations for each home. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the effect of radon on childhood leukemia risk within different strata of air pollution and traffic density. RESULTS: The relative risk for childhood leukemia in association with a 10(3) Bq/m(3)-years increase in radon was 1.77 (1.11, 2.82) among those exposed to high levels of NO(x) and 1.23 (0.79, 1.91) for those exposed to low levels of NO(x) (p(interaction,) 0.17). Analyses for different morphological subtypes of leukemia and within different strata of traffic density showed a non-significant pattern of stronger associations between radon and childhood leukemia within strata of higher traffic density at the street address. INTERPRETATION: Air pollution from traffic may enhance the effect of radon on the risk of childhood leukemia. The observed tendency may also be attributed to chance.","['Brauner, Elvira Vaclavik', 'Andersen, Claus E', 'Andersen, Helle P', 'Gravesen, Peter', 'Lind, Morten', 'Ulbak, Kaare', 'Hertel, Ole', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole']","['Brauner EV', 'Andersen CE', 'Andersen HP', 'Gravesen P', 'Lind M', 'Ulbak K', 'Hertel O', 'Schuz J', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O']","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. elvira@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100706,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Vehicle Emissions)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['*Air Pollution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Radon/*analysis/*toxicity', 'Risk', 'Vehicle Emissions/*toxicity']",2010/07/08 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-010-9608-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2010 Nov;21(11):1961-4. doi: 10.1007/s10552-010-9608-4.

A 60-year-old woman presented with bilateral thigh pain for 6 months. A plain radiograph revealed bilateral progressive insufficient fractures on the subtrochanteric areas of the femurs. MRI of the femurs revealed incomplete stress fractures and no evidence of bone metastasis on either femur. Bone densitometry showed normal T-scores around the hip joint and spine. The patient had normal serum levels of calcium, vitamin D derivatives, and thyroid hormones. Serum phosphate levels were decreased, and parathyroid hormone levels were increased. Serum osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptide of collagen cross-links (NTx) were both decreased. A bone biopsy demonstrated normocellular marrow without leukemic cells. A histomorphometric evaluation of her bones revealed reduced bone turnover despite secondary hyperparathyroidism. The serum markers for bone metabolism and histomorphometric evaluations in this patient suggest that the drug may have an effect on bone metabolism. These effects could be seen for both bone formation and resorption: this could result in impaired bone mineralization, a severely suppressed bone turnover rate, insufficient fractures, and bone necrosis, which are sometimes seen with long-term use of bisphosphonates. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an insufficient bilateral femoral shaft fracture that is potentially related to the use of imatinib mesylate in a patient with CML. Careful examination of bone metabolism should be performed in patients with CML because imatinib mesylate treatment is a lifelong process.","['Yang, Kyu-Hyun', 'Park, Si-Young', 'Park, Sang-Won', 'Lee, Soon-Hyuck', 'Han, Seung-Beom', 'Jung, Woong-Kyo', 'Kim, Suk-Jin']","['Yang KH', 'Park SY', 'Park SW', 'Lee SH', 'Han SB', 'Jung WK', 'Kim SJ']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yonsei Univerisity, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100706,Japan,J Bone Miner Metab,Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,9436705,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Remodeling/drug effects', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Femoral Fractures/blood/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Hypophosphatemia/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radiography']",2010/07/08 06:00,2011/03/17 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2009/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00774-010-0203-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Metab. 2010 Nov;28(6):713-8. doi: 10.1007/s00774-010-0203-2.

The aim of this study was to investigate DC differentiation under the influence of leukemic cell products. Monocytes from healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF for the generation of immature DCs. Supernatants from leukemic cultures were added to monocyte cultures during differentiation. The lineages used were K562, a chronic myeloid leukemia, HL-60, a promyelocytic leukemia and DAUDI, originated from Burkitt lymphoma. It was observed that the expression of CD14 remained high and the CD1a was low in the presence of tumor supernatants, while non-malignant supernatants did not affect these parameters. Furthermore, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production by monocytes during differentiation was increased by the presence of tumor supernatants. The modifications on CD14 and CD1a expressions could be mimicked by the addition of exogenous IL-1beta and partially inhibited by the neutralization of IL-1beta. These results suggest that soluble products from leukemic cells interfere with DC differentiation and, in the present work, this effect could be mediated by monocyte-derived IL-1beta in response to tumor supernatants.","['Motta, Juliana Maria', 'Nascimento, Clarissa Rodrigues', 'Rumjanek, Vivian Mary']","['Motta JM', 'Nascimento CR', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Instituto de Bioquimica Medica, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100706,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2010/07/08 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2009/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0890-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Nov;59(11):1645-53. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0890-5.

These suggestions are driven by epidemiological evidence, and it has been common to characterize that evidence as showing a threshold effect, with no increase in risk below a threshold, often 0.3 or 0.4 muT, and a constant risk above it. Such a threshold would, however, be biologically unlikely. We tested alternative dose-response relationships quantitatively. We obtained five exposure data sets, applied several candidate dose-response relationships to each one, and performed a regression analysis to see how well they fit each of the three epidemiological data sets. Threshold dose-response relationships performed only moderately. Linear relationships were generally even poorer. The fit was improved by adding quadratic terms or performing non-linear regression. There are limitations in our analysis, stemming from the available data, but addressing this issue in a data-based, quantitative manner should improve understanding, allow better calculations to be made of attributable numbers, and hence ultimately inform public policy making.","['Kheifets, Leeka', 'Afifi, Abdelmonem', 'Monroe, Jason', 'Swanson, John']","['Kheifets L', 'Afifi A', 'Monroe J', 'Swanson J']","['UCLA School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Los Angeles, California 90095-1772, USA. kheifets@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100707,United States,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,101262796,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Electric Power Supplies', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis/legislation & jurisprudence/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Magnetic Fields', 'Public Policy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors']",2010/07/08 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['jes201038 [pii]', '10.1038/jes.2010.38 [doi]']",ppublish,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol. 2011 Nov-Dec;21(6):625-33. doi: 10.1038/jes.2010.38.

The biggest camp for children with cancer and their families provided an opportunity to conduct such an investigation. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 76 attendee and 86 non-attendee families. Parents and children completed a series of validated questionnaires addressing family functioning (the primary effect measure); health-related quality of life (HRQL) of the patients; the children's behavior and relationships; parental behavior, mood and social support; parental nurturance, rejection and monitoring (from the perspective of the children); and a health and social service utilization inventory. RESULTS: The most common diagnoses in the attendee and nonattendee groups were acute lymphoblastic leukemia and central nervous system tumors, respectively. A higher proportion of attendees were receiving active treatment (26.7% vs. 5.8%), almost all for relapsed disease. Parent attendees reported significantly better family function and social support, and parenting skills and coping, than nonattendee parents. The parental proxy assessments of the children's overall HRQL revealed significantly better scores for the attendees, although there was a greater burden of pain among attendees and of cognitive morbidity among nonattendees. Costs related to health care and social services were substantially greater in the attendee families. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer cannot be randomized not to attend camp. So the results of this study cannot resolve the conundrum--do better-adapted families attend a camp designed to meet the special needs of their children, or does attendance materially improve the health and welfare of families of children with cancer? However, the very proliferation of such camps is indicative of a need being met and greater efforts should be made to promote the camping experience, and to encourage such children and their families to participate.","['Barr, Ronald D', 'Silva, Agustina', 'Wong, Maria', 'Frid, William', 'Posgate, Susan', 'Browne, Gina']","['Barr RD', 'Silva A', 'Wong M', 'Frid W', 'Posgate S', 'Browne G']","[""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. rbarr@mcmaster.ca""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parents/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/08 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181dccc1f [doi]', '00043426-201007000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Jul;32(5):358-65. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181dccc1f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NPM mutant specifically inhibits the activities of the cell-death proteases, caspase-6 and -8, through direct interaction with their cleaved, active forms, but not the immature procaspases. The cytoplasmic NPM mutant not only affords protection from death ligand-induced cell death but also suppresses caspase-6/-8-mediated myeloid differentiation.

Bidirectional crosstalk between chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) cells and marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) activates both cell types. In this study, we observed that the conditioned medium (CM) obtained from CLL cells was able to induce Akt activation in MSC. Subsequent studies investigated the mechanism of MSC activation mediated by CLL-CM. Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) were selectively activated in MSCs by CLL-CM and found to be critical receptors for CLL-CM-driven MSC proliferation and MSC Akt activation. The known ligands of PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were detected in CLL-CM, but PDGF was the predominant ligand involved in the CM-mediated PDGFR activation. Both PDGF and VEGF were found to be elevated in the plasma of CLL patients with a positive association for high-risk factors and more advanced stage. Finally, we demonstrated that PDGF induced MSC VEGF production through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. These results show that PDGF-PDGFR signaling influences at least the MSC in the microenvironment of CLL and may play a role in the induction of an angiogenic switch known to be permissive for disease progression.","['Ding, Wei', 'Knox, Traci R', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Wu, Wenting', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Boysen, Justin C', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Ding W', 'Knox TR', 'Tschumper RC', 'Wu W', 'Schwager SM', 'Boysen JC', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100706,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/blood/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood/metabolism']",2010/07/08 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31226-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-269894 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2984-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-269894.

These encouraging data led Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial of gemcitabine/bevacizumab versus gemcitabine/placebo in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had no prior therapy for advanced disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, no tumor invasion of adjacent organs, and no increased bleeding risk. The primary end point was overall survival. Patients were stratified by performance status, extent of disease, and prior radiotherapy. Patients received gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m(2) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo on days 1 and 15 every 28 days. RESULTS: Between June 2004 and April 2006, 602 patients were enrolled onto the study and 535 were treated. Median overall survival was 5.8 months for gemcitabine/bevacizumab and 5.9 months for gemcitabine/placebo (P = .95). Median progression-free survival was 3.8 and 2.9 months, respectively (P = .07). Overall response rates were 13% and 10%, respectively. Patients with a performance status of 0, 1, and 2 survived a median of 7.9, 4.8, and 2.4 months, respectively. The only statistically significant differences in grades 3 and 4 toxicity occurred for hypertension (10% v 3%; P < .001) and proteinuria (5% v 1%; P = .002); venous thrombosis grade > or = 3 was equivalent in both arms (14% and 15%, respectively).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 94 total patients (age range, 19 to 66 years), 35 represented the control cohort (ie, imatinib-negative [IM-negative] group), and 59 received imatinib 600 mg/d orally for 7 consecutive days (ie, imatinib-positive [IM-positive] group), starting from day 15 of chemotherapy course 1 and from 3 days before chemotherapy during courses 2 to 8. Patients in CR were eligible for allogeneic SCT or, alternatively, for high-dose therapy with autologous SCT followed by long-term maintenance with intermittent imatinib. RESULTS: CR and SCT rates were greater in the IM-positive group (CR: 92% v 80.5%; P = .08; allogeneic SCT: 63% v 39%; P = .041). At a median observation time of 5 years (range, 0.6 to 9.2 years), 22 patients in the IM-positive group versus five patients in the IM-negative group were alive in first CR (P = .037). Patients in the IM-positive group had significantly greater overall and disease-free survival probabilities (overall: 0.38 v 0.23; P = .009; disease free: 0.39 v 0.25; P = .044) and a lower incidence of relapse (P = .005). SCT-related mortality was 28% (ie, 15 of 54 patients), and postgraft survival probability was 0.46 overall. CONCLUSION: This imatinib-based protocol improved long-term outcome of adult patients with Ph-positive ALL. With SCT, post-transplantation mortality and relapse remain the major hindrance to additional therapeutic improvement. Additional intensification of imatinib therapy should warrant a better molecular response and clinical outcome, both in patients selected for SCT and in those unable to undergo this procedure.","['Bassan, Renato', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Pogliani, Enrico M', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Cavattoni, Irene', 'Lambertenghi-Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Mannelli, Francesco', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Mattei, Daniele', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Terruzzi, Elisabetta', 'Borghero, Carlo', 'Romani, Claudio', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Tosi, Manuela', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Bassan R', 'Rossi G', 'Pogliani EM', 'Di Bona E', 'Angelucci E', 'Cavattoni I', 'Lambertenghi-Deliliers G', 'Mannelli F', 'Levis A', 'Ciceri F', 'Mattei D', 'Borlenghi E', 'Terruzzi E', 'Borghero C', 'Romani C', 'Spinelli O', 'Tosi M', 'Oldani E', 'Intermesoli T', 'Rambaldi A']","['U.S.C.

Here, we demonstrate that the apoptotic action of ATO is greatly increased when combined with subcytotoxic curcumin concentrations in U937 and HL60 human acute myeloid leukemia cells, and with lower efficacy in K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Curcumin exerts similar cooperative effect with the mitochondria-targeting drug lonidamine, whereas the response is negligible in combination with the DNA-targeting drug cisplatin. Curcumin plus ATO or lonidamine stimulates typical events of the mitochondrial executioner pathway (Bax and Bid activation, cytochrome c release, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis down-regulation, and caspase-9/-3 activation) and causes mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation, which nevertheless represents a late event in the apoptotic response. Curcumin increases anion superoxide production, and its proapoptotic action in combination with ATO and lonidamine is mimicked by pro-oxidant agents (2-methoxyestradiol and H(2)O(2)) and prevented by antioxidant agents [Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride and N-acetyl-l-cysteine]. Within the assayed time period (16-24 h), curcumin does not significantly modify p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase phosphorylation/activation or nuclear factor-kappaB activity, but it greatly stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and decreases Akt phosphorylation. Experiments using mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK inhibitors [2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059) and 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene (U0126)] and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) indicate that ERK activation does not mediate and even restrains apoptosis potentiation, whereas Akt down-regulation facilitates apoptosis generation. In summary, cotreatment with curcumin may represent a useful manner of increasing the efficacy of ATO and lonidamine as antitumor drugs in myeloid leukemia cells.","['Sanchez, Yolanda', 'Simon, Gloria P', 'Calvino, Eva', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Sanchez Y', 'Simon GP', 'Calvino E', 'de Blas E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100706,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'U78804BIDR (lonidamine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2010/07/08 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.110.168344 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.110.168344 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2010 Oct;335(1):114-23. doi: 10.1124/jpet.110.168344.

Using AOT (docusate sodium salt) as emulsifier, we obtained cores, stabilized by an AOT/PLL (poly-L-lysine hydrobromide) surface complex. These positively charged cores were encapsulated by layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes, biocompatible polyanion PGA (poly-L-glutamic acid sodium salt), and biocompatible polycation PLL. We used the saturation method for formation of consecutive layers, and we determined the optimal conditions concerning concentration of surfactant and polyelectrolytes to form stable shells. The average size of the obtained capsules was 60 nm. Pegylated external layer were prepared using PGA-g-PEG (PGA grafted by PEG poly(ethylene glycol)). The capsules were stable for at least a period of 3 months. These nanocapsules were biocompatible when tested for cytotoxicity in a cellular coculture assay and demonstrated no or very low nonspecific binding to peripheral blood mononuclear cells when tested by flow cytometry. In order to study drug effects on leukemia cells, beta-carotene and vitamin A have been encapsulated as model drugs.","['Szczepanowicz, K', 'Hoel, H J', 'Szyk-Warszynska, L', 'Bielanska, E', 'Bouzga, A M', 'Gaudernack, G', 'Simon, C', 'Warszynski, P']","['Szczepanowicz K', 'Hoel HJ', 'Szyk-Warszynska L', 'Bielanska E', 'Bouzga AM', 'Gaudernack G', 'Simon C', 'Warszynski P']","['Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Niezpominajek 8, Krakow 30-239, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Langmuir,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,9882736,"['0 (Emulsifying Agents)', '0 (Nanocapsules)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Polyelectrolytes)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (polycations)', '10041-19-7 (Dioctyl Sulfosuccinic Acid)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Dioctyl Sulfosuccinic Acid/chemistry', 'Emulsifying Agents/chemistry', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Nanocapsules/*chemistry', 'Polyamines/chemistry', 'Polyelectrolytes', 'Polyglutamic Acid/chemistry', 'Polymers/*chemistry']",2010/07/08 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/la102061s [doi]'],ppublish,Langmuir. 2010 Aug 3;26(15):12592-7. doi: 10.1021/la102061s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, consolidation strategies using non-cross resistant agents have improved the success rates of patients with residual disease at the end of induction treatment. Together, these new developments promise to deliver the tools necessary to render a state of minimal residual disease negativity in the majority of patients commencing treatment for CLL.

We investigated the expression and function of this pathway in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and in healthy B lymphocytes. Profiling of cognate Hh pathway members revealed reduced expression of two key Hh signaling effectors, Smoothened (SMOH) and GLI, in CLL cells, whereas transcription levels of other investigated members resembled normal B-lymphocyte levels. Examining the functional role of SMOH and GLI in cell survival, we found that CLL cells were hardly sensitive toward specific SMOH inhibition, but showed an unspecific decline in cell viability in response to high concentrations of the SMOH antagonist cyclopamine. In contrast, treatment with the novel GLI antagonist GANT61 reduced expression of the target gene Patched and preferentially decreased the viability of malignant cells. Specific RNA interference knockdown experiments in a CLL-derived cell line confirmed the autonomous role of GLI in malignant cell survival. GANT61-induced apoptosis in primary leukemic cells was partly attenuated by protective stromal cells, but not soluble sonic hedgehog ligand. In summary, our data show a downregulation of the classical Hh pathway in CLL and suggest an intrinsic SMOH-independent role of GLI in the ex vivo survival of CLL cells.","['Desch, P', 'Asslaber, D', 'Kern, D', 'Schnidar, H', 'Mangelberger, D', 'Alinger, B', 'Stoecher, M', 'Hofbauer, S W', 'Neureiter, D', 'Tinhofer, I', 'Aberger, F', 'Hartmann, T N', 'Greil, R']","['Desch P', 'Asslaber D', 'Kern D', 'Schnidar H', 'Mangelberger D', 'Alinger B', 'Stoecher M', 'Hofbauer SW', 'Neureiter D', 'Tinhofer I', 'Aberger F', 'Hartmann TN', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, IIIrd Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100705,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (GANT 61)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (SMO protein, human)', '0 (Smoothened Receptor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Veratrum Alkaloids)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'ZH658AJ192 (cyclopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Smoothened Receptor', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Veratrum Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2010/07/07 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010243 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.243 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Sep 2;29(35):4885-95. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.243.

Pharicin A induces mitotic arrest in leukemia and solid tumor-derived cells identified by their morphology, DNA content and mitotic marker analyses. Pharicin A-induced mitotic arrest is associated with unaligned chromosomes, aberrant BubR1 localization and deregulated spindle checkpoint activation. Pharicin A directly binds to BubR1 in vitro, which is correlated with premature sister chromatid separation in vivo. Pharicin A also induces mitotic arrest in paclitaxel-resistant Jurkat and U2OS cells.

RESULTS: AML MRC patients showed a lower complete remission (CR) rate (44.7% vs. 64.9%, P=0.002) and shorter OS (297 vs. 561 days, P=0.004) and EFS (229 vs. 374 days, P=0.004) than AML NOS patients. Patients with MLD among AML MRC also showed a lower CR rate (37.7%, P=0.001) and shorter OS (351 days, P=0.036) and EFS (242 days, P=0.076) than AML NOS patients. However, among AML MRC patients, there were no differences in OS, EFS and CR between patients with and without MLD. CONCLUSIONS: AML MRC patients showed a lower CR rate and shorter OS and EFS than AML NOS patients. AML MRC patients with MLD showed similar results and their prognosis was not different from those without MLD. MLD findings among AML MRC could be an independent poor prognostic factor in de novo AML.","['Park, Sang Hyuk', 'Chi, Hyun Sook', 'Park, Seo Jin', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Park, Chan Jeoung']","['Park SH', 'Chi HS', 'Park SJ', 'Jang S', 'Park CJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2010/07/07 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['201006231 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.231 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Jun;30(3):231-8. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the microscopic evaluation lacks objectivity because of considerable variations among different observers. We measured myelocrit cellularity as an objective method to evaluate the cellularity. METHODS: Between November 2007 and January 2008, 489 consecutive BM aspirates including 25 cases of AML D7 marrow (7 days after initiation of chemotherapy) were examined. The conventional BM cellularity was evaluated using BM needle biopsies after hematoxylin-eosin stain. EDTA-anticoagulated BM aspirates were put into the Wintrobe tubes, centrifuged and the thickness of 5 layers from the bottom was measured: RBC, buffy coat (BC), plasma, BM particle, and fat layers. The myelocrit cellularity was defined as the ratio of BC to the BC plus fat layers. RESULTS: Both of the thickness of BC layer (r=0.721, P=0.000) and the myelocrit cellularity (r=0.735, P=0.000) correlated well with the conventional cellularity. However, the AML D7 BM cellularity correlated with BC layer (r=0.589, P=0.002), but not with the myelocrit cellularity (r=0.281, P=0.231). The cellularity of the BM other than AML D7 marrow showed a better correlation with the myelocrit cellularity (r=0.826, P=0.000) than the BC layer (r=0.713, P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The myelocrit is a simple, reproducible and objective method to determine the BM cellularity. For accurate assessment of BM cellularity, measurement of the thickness of BC layer in AML D7 BM and of the myelocrit cellularity in other BM samples has better be used.","['Chang, Jiyoung', 'Park, Hunhee', 'Chae, Hyojin', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Han, Kyungja']","['Chang J', 'Park H', 'Chae H', 'Kim M', 'Kim Y', 'Han K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2010/07/07 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['201006224 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.224 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Jun;30(3):224-30. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.224.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports that suggest an association between CML and constitutional pericentric inversion of chromosome 9. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the frequency and clinical features of CML patients with concomitant inv(9) and t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) variation at our institution. METHODS: We reviewed the bone marrow chromosome database entries between October 2006 and December 2008 to identify patients with concomitant inv(9) and t(9;22) variations. Laboratory and clinical data of the patients were obtained from the electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Among the 51 CML patients, 4 (7.8%) had concomitant inv(9) and t(9;22) variations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the association between inv(9) variation and CML is still controversial, we believe that hematologists should consider the role of constitutional inv(9) variation in CML patients to avoid overlooking the impaired engraftment potential of hematopoietic stem cells harboring inv(9). Therefore, we suggest that more effort should be invested to develop cytogenetic tests for detecting constitutional inv(9) variation in CML patients.","['Suh, Borum', 'Song, Jaewoo', 'Kim, Juwon', 'Park, Tae Sung', 'Choi, Jong Rak']","['Suh B', 'Song J', 'Kim J', 'Park TS', 'Choi JR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,IM,"['Adult', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Centrosome', '*Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2010/07/07 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['201006218 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.218 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Jun;30(3):218-23. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2010.30.3.218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also GdR is toxic for T lymphocytes, provided its degradation by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is prevented, by genetic loss of PNP or by enzyme inhibitors. The toxicity of both nucleosides requires their phosphorylation to triphosphates, indicating involvement of DNA replication. In cultured cells we found by isotope-flow experiments with labeled araG a rapid accumulation and turnover of araG phosphates regulated by cytosolic and mitochondrial kinases and deoxynucleotidases. At equilibrium their partition between cytosol and mitochondria depended on the substrate saturation kinetics and cellular abundance of the kinases leading to higher araGTP concentrations in mitochondria. dGTP interfered with the allosteric regulation of ribonucleotide reduction, led to highly imbalanced dNTP pools with gradual inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell-cycle arrest at the G1-S boundary. AraGTP had no effect on ribonucleotide reduction. AraG was in minute amounts incorporated into nuclear DNA and stopped DNA synthesis arresting cells in S-phase. Both nucleosides eventually induced caspases and led to apoptosis. We used high, clinically relevant concentrations of araG, toxic for nuclear DNA synthesis. Our experiments do not exclude an effect on mitochondrial DNA at low araG concentrations when phosphorylation occurs mainly in mitochondria.","['Leanza, Luigi', 'Miazzi, Cristina', 'Ferraro, Paola', 'Reichard, Peter', 'Bianchi, Vera']","['Leanza L', 'Miazzi C', 'Ferraro P', 'Reichard P', 'Bianchi V']","['Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100711,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', ""72490-81-4 (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8C2O37Y44Q (deoxyguanosine triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.113 (deoxyguanosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleotides/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Biocatalysis', 'CHO Cells', 'Caspases/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects']",2010/07/07 06:00,2011/01/28 06:00,['2010/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00344-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.06.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Dec 10;316(20):3443-53. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.06.023.

However, it is difficult to explain the mechanism of anorexia/cachexia with PTHrP secretion in detail. Previously, we demonstrated that the expressions of orexigenic peptides increased and anorexigenic peptides decreased under cachectic conditions in rats carrying tumors secreting PTHrP. In this study, we investigated whether such changes in the expression of hypothalamic feeding-regulating peptides can be solely attributed to PTHrP or are a general response under cachectic conditions. Cachectic syndromes were induced in rats by: (i) inoculation of human lung cancer LC-6 cells that secreted PTHrP, (ii) inoculation of human melanoma SEKI cells that secrete not PTHrP but LIF1, (iii) injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium leading to arthritis (AA) and (iv) oral administration of a high dose of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) that resulted in hypercalcemia. The LC-6-bearing rats and AA rats were treated with or without anti-PTHrP antibody and indomethacin, respectively, and the expression of the hypothalamic feeding-regulating peptide mRNAs were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The orexigenic peptide mRNAs, such as neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein, were significantly increased, and that of anorexigenic peptide mRNAs, such as proopiomelanocortin, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript and corticotropin-releasing hormone were significantly decreased when they developed cachectic syndromes and AA. A high dose of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) caused hypercalcemia and body weight loss but did not affect the expression of hypothalamic feeding-regulating peptide mRNAs.

One possible factor is dynamic adaptation of the leukemia cell to the allogeneic environment. This work tested the hypothesis that the pattern of gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in an allogeneic environment would differ from that in a non-allogeneic environment. Expression microarray studies were performed in murine B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells recovered from mice that had undergone allogeneic MHC-matched but minor histocompatibility antigen mismatched transplants. A limited number of genes were found to be differentially expressed in ALL cells surviving in the allogeneic environment. Functional analysis demonstrated that genes related to immune processes, antigen presentation, ubiquitination and GTPase function were significantly enriched. Several genes with known immune activities potentially relevant to leukemia survival (Ly6a/Sca-1, TRAIL and H2-T23) were examined in independent validation experiments. Increased expression in vivo in allogeneic hosts was observed, and could be mimicked in vitro with soluble supernatants of mixed lymphocyte reactions or interferon-gamma. The changes in gene expression were reversible when the leukemia cells were removed from the allogeneic environment. These findings suggest that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells respond to cytokines present after allogeneic transplantation and that these changes may reduce the effectiveness of GVL activity.","['Shand, Jessica C', 'Jansson, Johan', 'Hsu, Yu-Chiao', 'Campbell, Andrew', 'Mullen, Craig A']","['Shand JC', 'Jansson J', 'Hsu YC', 'Campbell A', 'Mullen CA']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100703,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Survival/*physiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0889-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2010 Nov;59(11):1633-44. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0889-y.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment cellular bcl-2 protein expression was measured in bone marrow samples obtained from 68 patients of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and 10 healthy controls by western blotting. RESULTS: The mean bcl-2 protein expression was significantly higher in patients (0.686+/-0.592) compared to controls (0.313+/-0.016) (p=0.002). The overall survival for patients with mean bcl-2 expression of less, and more than or equal to 0.315, was 67% and 56%, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.86). CONCLUSION: Even though we did not observe a significant difference in overall survival between patients with high and low levels of bcl-2, modulation of this protein might still be considered as an option for enhancing the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of seventy patients receiving L-asparaginase induction therapy for acute leukemia in the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University presenting with clinical neurological signs suggestive of aseptic intracranial venous thrombosis. All the patients were studied by 1.5 Tesla magnet using conventional MRI pulse sequences and MR venographic studies. The imaging findings were processed as regards the detection of venous thrombosis, its signal criteria and the evaluation of any companion brain parenchymal ischemic insults. RESULTS: Eleven patients were diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis with subsequent specific signal pattern of the thrombus that could be linked to the duration of thrombosis. The MR venographic studies detected the thrombosis in nine cases out of eleven. Ten cases scored brain parenchymal signal abnormality that could indicate infarction, eight of them were hemorrhagic in nature. CONCLUSION: L-asparaginase therapy is accompanied by high risk of venous thrombosis that could involve the intra-cranial sino-venous structures. MRI could be used effectively in the early diagnosis of such serious, curable complication using a combination of conventional spin echo pulse sequences and MR venographic studies. Hemorrhagic venous infarcts should draw the attention to underlying established venous thrombosis.

The development of innate CD8(+) T cells in mice deficient in the tyrosine kinase Itk and coactivator CBP was also attributable to this IL-4-dependent mechanism.

Over the last 12 months, there have been several studies with important new findings. RECENT FINDINGS: Two randomized controlled trials compared different doses of prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients with haematological malignancies. In neonates, platelet mass has been used as a trigger for prophylactic platelet transfusions rather than the morning platelet count; and interim results of a therapeutic vs. a prophylactic platelet-transfusion strategy in acute myeloblastic leukaemia have been published. SUMMARY: Low-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions are as effective in the prevention of bleeding as high-dose platelets. Fewer platelets were transfused but more frequent transfusions were required. Platelet mass as a transfusion trigger led to a lower prophylactic platelet requirement and did not increase the risk of bleeding in thrombocytopenic neonates. The interim results of the trial of a therapeutic vs. a prophylactic transfusion strategy were unable to provide any firm conclusion about their relative effectiveness and further information is required from ongoing trials.","['Estcourt, Lise J', 'Stanworth, Simon J', 'Murphy, Michael F']","['Estcourt LJ', 'Stanworth SJ', 'Murphy MF']","['Haematology/Transfusion Medicine, NHS Blood & Transplant and the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Hemorrhage/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods', 'Thrombocytopenia/*therapy']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32833c07e8 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Sep;17(5):411-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32833c07e8.,,,"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential role in late cardiac disease?,64-8,,"This report describes the long-term (23 years) follow-up of a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and eosinophilia who underwent multiple valve replacements. An 8-year-old boy with this complex disease was admitted in January 1984 and treated with 6-week course of vincristine, L-asparaginase, and prednisolone, which induced complete remission. He developed atrioventricular valvular insufficiency and infectious endocarditis at 13.5 and 17.3 years of ages, respectively, with progressive development of congestive heart failure. At 18.6 years of age, he underwent prosthetic valve replacement of both atrioventricular valves; the mitral valve was replaced with a mechanical prosthetic valve and tricuspid valve with a bioprosthetic valve. Histopathological examination of the ventricular endomyocardium showed extensive fibrous degeneration and persistent infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes. The right-side prosthesis was replaced twice, at 22.4 and 29 years of ages, due to degeneration of bioleaflets and thrombosis of the mechanical valve, respectively. Although he tolerated all surgical procedures, he developed liver cancer at 31 years of age and died. Autopsy could not be performed. The present study indicates that a subset of patients in complete remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and eosinophilia can show persistent myocardial eosinophilic infiltration and are at risk of late cardiac disease.","['Tsuji, Atsutoshi', 'Sasaki, Michiko', 'Ishii, Toru', 'Sato, Seiji', 'Kanki, Hideaki', 'Suzuki, Satoru', 'Takeuchi, Shigeyuki', 'Fukuda, Toyoki']","['Tsuji A', 'Sasaki M', 'Ishii T', 'Sato S', 'Kanki H', 'Suzuki S', 'Takeuchi S', 'Fukuda T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saitama Municipal Hospital, Saitama, Japan. tsuji.a.rugby@iuhw.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Keio J Med,The Keio journal of medicine,0376354,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiomyopathies/*etiology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Eosinophilia/*complications/*pathology', 'Heart Valve Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2302/kjm.59.64 [doi]'],ppublish,Keio J Med. 2010;59(2):64-8. doi: 10.2302/kjm.59.64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA reviewed the results of a planned interim analysis of a single-arm trial, enrolling 154 patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine, and a supportive dose-finding, activity-estimating trial in 33 patients with CLL. Patients in the primary efficacy study received ofatumumab weekly for eight doses, then every 4 weeks for an additional four doses; patients in the supportive trial received four weekly doses. In the primary efficacy study, endpoints were objective response rate and response duration. RESULTS: For regulatory purposes, the primary efficacy population consisted of 59 patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. In this subgroup, the investigator-determined objective response rate was 42% [99% confidence interval (CI), 26-60], with a median duration of response of 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.8-8.3); all were partial responses. The most common adverse reactions in the primary efficacy study were neutropenia, pneumonia, pyrexia, cough, diarrhea, anemia, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, nausea, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. Infusion reactions occurred in 44% of patients with the first infusion (300 mg) and 29% with the second infusion (2,000 mg). The most common serious adverse reactions were infections, neutropenia, and pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS: On October 26, 2009, the FDA granted accelerated approval to ofatumumab for the treatment of patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, on the basis of demonstration of durable tumor shrinkage.","['Lemery, Steven J', 'Zhang, Jenny', 'Rothmann, Mark D', 'Yang, Jun', 'Earp, Justin', 'Zhao, Hong', 'McDougal, Andrew', 'Pilaro, Anne', 'Chiang, Raymond', 'Gootenberg, Joseph E', 'Keegan, Patricia', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Lemery SJ', 'Zhang J', 'Rothmann MD', 'Yang J', 'Earp J', 'Zhao H', 'McDougal A', 'Pilaro A', 'Chiang R', 'Gootenberg JE', 'Keegan P', 'Pazdur R']","['Office of Oncology Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA. steven.lemery@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100702,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Approval/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0570 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0570 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 1;16(17):4331-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0570.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Messenger RNA isolated from CD34(+) cells from nine PV patients and normal controls was profiled using Affymetrix arrays. Gene expression change mediated by JAK2V617F was determined by profiling CD34(+) cells transduced with the kinase and by analysis of leukemia cell lines harboring JAK2V617F, treated with an inhibitor. RESULTS: A PV expression signature was enriched for genes involved in hematopoietic development, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation. By quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, 23 genes were consistently deregulated in all patient samples. Several of these genes such as WT1 and KLF4 were regulated by JAK2, whereas others such as NFIB and EVI1 seemed to be deregulated in PV by a JAK2-independent mechanism. Using cell line models and comparing gene expression profiles of cell lines and PV CD34(+) PV specimens, we have identified panels of 14 JAK2-dependent genes and 12 JAK2-independent genes. These two 14- and 12-gene sets could separate not only PV from normal CD34(+) specimens, but also other MPN such as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis from their normal counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of the aberrant gene expression in PV progenitor cells can be attributed to the action of the mutant kinase, but there remain a significant number of genes characteristic of the disease but deregulated by as yet unknown mechanisms. Genes deregulated in PV as a result of the action of JAK2V617F or independent of the kinase may represent other targets for therapy.","['Berkofsky-Fessler, Windy', 'Buzzai, Monica', 'Kim, Marianne K-H', 'Fruchtman, Steven', 'Najfeld, Vesna', 'Min, Dong-Joon', 'Costa, Fabricio F', 'Bischof, Jared M', 'Soares, Marcelo B', 'McConnell, Melanie Jane', 'Zhang, Weijia', 'Levine, Ross', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Calogero, Raffaele', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Berkofsky-Fessler W', 'Buzzai M', 'Kim MK', 'Fruchtman S', 'Najfeld V', 'Min DJ', 'Costa FF', 'Bischof JM', 'Soares MB', 'McConnell MJ', 'Zhang W', 'Levine R', 'Gilliland DG', 'Calogero R', 'Licht JD']","['Translational Research Sciences, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100702,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-1092 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1092 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Sep 1;16(17):4339-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1092.

However, ABT-737, a specific BCL2 inhibitor, is neither orally bioavailable nor metabolically stable. To overcome these problems, the structurally related molecule ABT-263 was synthesized and recently entered clinical trials in hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Almost all laboratory studies have been carried out with ABT-737 rather than ABT-263, the drug being used in clinical trials. Currently there are no published data on the comparative effects of these inhibitors. To gain insight into the potential value or limitations of ABT-263 in the clinic, we assessed its ability to induce apoptosis in clinically relevant cellular models of CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The susceptibility of freshly isolated primary CLL cells to these inhibitors was compared in standard culture conditions and in conditions that more closely mimic in vivo conditions in a whole blood assay system. RESULTS: ABT-737 was more potent than ABT-263 at inducing apoptosis in CLL cells. In whole blood, approximately 100-fold higher concentrations of both drugs were required to induce apoptosis. We found that ABT-263 was highly bound by albumin and that an increased albumin binding of ABT-263 as compared with ABT-737 accounted for the differential sensitivity of CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the exquisite in vitro sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL2 inhibitors may be lost in vivo due to high cell densities and the albumin binding of ABT-263. Modification of ABT-263 may yield a BCL2 inhibitor with greater bioavailability and more favorable pharmacokinetics.","['Vogler, Meike', 'Furdas, Silviya D', 'Jung, Manfred', 'Kuwana, Tomomi', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Vogler M', 'Furdas SD', 'Jung M', 'Kuwana T', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100702,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Albumins)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Albumins/*metabolism', 'Aniline Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Availability', 'Biphenyl Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0777 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0777 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 15;16(16):4217-25. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0777.

The data covers the years 1974 to 2007. AIM OF THIS STUDY: was to estimate the magnitude of the cancer problem in Kuwait over the period 1974-2007. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence rates (ASR) with standard error (er) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of age-standardized rates were estimated. Statistical significance was assessed by examining the standardized rate ratio (SRR). RESULTS: It was noted that by following the Cancer registry data there was a trend of increase in adjusted rates among both males and females. Looking into specific cancers it was noticed that comparing the ASR of colorectal cancer among Kuwaiti males, it increased by about 5 folds over the last 33 years and ranked the 1st most frequent site on the years 2003-2007. Prostate cancer incidence increased by 3 folds (14.5 cases /100,000 populations) and ranked the 4th most frequent site among Kuwaiti males. The incidence of Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and leukemia had increased by 1.5 to 2 folds over the same time period. The rise of lung cancer incidence declined to similar rates compared to that observed in the early 70s and 80s. For Kuwaiti females breast cancer had the highest incidence among Kuwaiti population (15 cases /100,000 populations), it increased by 3 folds (50 cases /100,000 populations) over the last 33 years. The incidence of colorectal cancer increased by about 4 folds; (13 cases /100,000 populations). NHL and leukemia increased by 2-2.5 folds over the same studied duration. Meanwhile Thyroid cancer increased by one fold. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Some of the differences in cancer rates over the last 33 years are likely to be attributable to the variation in exposure to specific etiologic factors that are caused by differences in lifestyle and habits, such as dietary, physical activity and obesity. Further research with a view to understanding these changes in cancer incidence is warranted. The need for an interventional prevention programs that vigorously involve, diet, anti-smoking and physical activity among both sexes.","['Elbasmi, A', 'Al-Asfour, A', 'Al-Nesf, Y', 'Al-Awadi, A']","['Elbasmi A', 'Al-Asfour A', 'Al-Nesf Y', 'Al-Awadi A']","['Kuwait Cancer Control Center, State of Kuwait. elbasmy@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kuwait/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Time Factors']",2010/07/06 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2010 Jul;(8):7-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a microscale direct writing (MDW) technique, we characterized the generation of multicomponent ECM microarrays for cellular micropatterning, localization and stem cell fate determination. ECMs and other biomolecules of various geometries and sizes were printed onto epoxide-modified glass substrates to evaluate cell attachment by human endothelial cells. The endothelial cells displayed strong preferential attachment to the ECM patterned regions and aligned their cytoskeleton along the direction of the micropatterns. We next generated ECM microarrays that contained one or more ECM components (namely gelatin, collagen IV and fibronectin) and then cultured murine embryonic stem cell (ESCs) on the microarrays. The ESCs selectively attached to the micropatterned features and expressed markers associated with a pluripotent phenotype, such as E-cadherin and alkaline phosphatase, when maintained in growth medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor. In the presence of the soluble factors retinoic acid and bone morphogenetic protein-4 the ESCs differentiated towards the ectodermal lineage on the ECM microarray with differential ECM effects. The ESCs cultured on gelatin showed significantly higher levels of pan cytokeratin expression, when compared with cells cultured on collagen IV or fibronectin, suggesting that gelatin preferentially promotes ectodermal differentiation. In summary, our results demonstrate that MDW is a versatile approach to print ECMs of diverse geometries and compositions onto surfaces, and it is amenable to the generation of multicomponent ECM microarrays for stem cell fate determination.","['Huang, Ngan F', 'Patlolla, Bhagat', 'Abilez, Oscar', 'Sharma, Himanshu', 'Rajadas, Jaykumar', 'Beygui, Ramin E', 'Zarins, Christopher K', 'Cooke, John P']","['Huang NF', 'Patlolla B', 'Abilez O', 'Sharma H', 'Rajadas J', 'Beygui RE', 'Zarins CK', 'Cooke JP']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100701,England,Acta Biomater,Acta biomaterialia,101233144,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Ectoderm/cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'Rats']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1742-7061(10)00299-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.actbio.2010.06.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biomater. 2010 Dec;6(12):4614-21. doi: 10.1016/j.actbio.2010.06.033.

In addition, propolis components vary depending on the area from which they are collected due to variations among wild plants in an area. Therefore, we compared the effects of water and ethanol extracts of propolis from Brazil and China on mast cell degranulation and cytokine production, thereby identifying effective components in propolis. The amount of released beta-hexosaminidase via high-affinity IgE receptor I (Fc epsilon RI) from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells was used as an index of degranulation. All propolis extracts inhibited degranulation from antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, but the effective doses differed according to collection areas. The ethanol extract of Chinese propolis, which was the strongest inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, was divided into compounds using normal- and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The isolated anti-allergic components were identified as chrysin, kaempferol and its derivative, and chrysin was revealed to inhibit IL-4 and MCP-1 production from antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. HPLC quantification also revealed the Brazilian propolis extract to contain only small amounts of these flavonoids, which suggested that variation in propolis components could affect anti-allergic properties.","['Nakamura, Rika', 'Nakamura, Ryosuke', 'Watanabe, Kayoko', 'Oka, Kazuo', 'Ohta, Shozo', 'Mishima, Satoshi', 'Teshima, Reiko']","['Nakamura R', 'Nakamura R', 'Watanabe K', 'Oka K', 'Ohta S', 'Mishima S', 'Teshima R']","['Division of Novel Foods and Immunochemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1, Kami-yoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 158-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100629,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '3CN01F5ZJ5 (chrysin)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', '9009-62-5 (Propolis)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Basophils/drug effects', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytokines/analysis', 'Flavonoids/isolation & purification', 'Interleukin-4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kaempferols/isolation & purification', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Propolis/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/25 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(10)00200-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2010.06.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2010 Sep;10(9):1107-12. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2010.06.013.

We retrospectively analyzed 175 adult CML patients who underwent HSCT at our institution between 1983 and 2007, with the aim to compare outcomes in patient subgroups and to identify prognostic variables. The median follow-up was 65 months. The probability of overall survival (OS) for all patients was 62%, with a significant improvement seen in the imatinib-era (2001-2007) compared to previous time periods (P <.05). Furthermore, a significantly better outcome for patients with chronic phase CML compared to patients with accelerated or blast phase could be observed (P < .05). Cumulative incidence (CI) of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 9.7% at 100 days and 1 year after HSCT. CI of relapse was 5% at 1 year and 7.5% at 3 years after HSCT. Post-HSCT outcome was not influenced by pretreatment therapy with imatinib, donor type, or a conditioning regimen with total body irradiation (TBI).

Recently, the combination of VPA with other anticancer agents has been considered as a useful and necessary strategy to specifically induce anticancer gene expression. Curcumin (Cur) is a promising natural anticancer agent that can specifically regulate the expression of NF-kappaB, bcl-2, and bax in leukemia cells. However, no literature is available on the anticancer effects of the combination of VPA and Cur. Here we show that this combination significantly increases Sp1 binding, histone H3 and H4 acetylation in the promoter region of bax, but not in that of bcl-2. This specifically up-regulates bax expression and leads to HL-60 cell proliferation arrest, sub-G1 DNA accumulation and cell death. Further studies reveal that Cur specifically activates p38 MAPK, an essential factor for Sp1 binding at the bax promoter. Moreover, both inhibition of p38 MAPK and knock-down of bax expression significantly prevent VPA and Cur-induced proliferation arrest and death in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that Cur could p38-dependently promote bax expression and hence enhance the anticancer activity of VPA in human leukemia cells.","['Chen, Jie', 'Wang, Guiying', 'Wang, Libing', 'Kang, Jiuhong', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Chen J', 'Wang G', 'Wang L', 'Kang J', 'Wang J']","[""Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100625,Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0928-0987(10)00244-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejps.2010.06.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2010 Oct 9;41(2):210-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejps.2010.06.011.

The n-hexane fraction containing alantolactone and isoalantolactone as its major constituents was further studied for its mode of action in HL-60 cells. The lowest IC(50) value of n-hexane fraction was 10.25 microg/ml for Colo-205, a colon cancer cell line whereas, 17.86 microg/ml was the highest IC(50) value observed against CNS cancer cell line SF-295. Further studies on HL-60 cells treated with n-hexane fraction at 10, 25 and 50 microg/ml for 6h, revealed that it induces apoptosis through intrinsic as well as extrinsic pathways by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates. Mitochondrial dysfunction prompted the release of cytochrome c, translocation of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax), activation of caspase cascade, resulting in the cleavage of some specific substrates for caspase-3 such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which eventually leads to apoptosis. The results of present study strongly support further research and development of bioactive constituents from Inula racemosa as potential anticancer agent with possible therapeutic implication.","['Pal, Harish Chandra', 'Sehar, Irum', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Gupta, Bishan Dutt', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar']","['Pal HC', 'Sehar I', 'Bhushan S', 'Gupta BD', 'Saxena AK']","['Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, J&K, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100617,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Inula/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(10)00149-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2010.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Sep;24(6):1599-609. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2010.06.007.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride to produce lethal effects in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. The MTT tetrazolium reduction test and the trypan blue exclusion assay revealed that the IC(50) for the compound after 48 h of incubation with K562 cells was approximately 10.74 and 73.45 microM, respectively. Interestingly, it was observed that this compound exhibits mild cytotoxicity towards MRC-5 human fibroblast cells (IC(50)>383 microM). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride was capable of change cell cycle distribution since the percentage of cells in the G1, S and G2 phases decreased. In addition, treatment with this compound induced apoptotic cell death in K562 cells, demonstrated by increased DNA content in the sub-G1-peak and a significant increase in caspase-3 activity. Assay using cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT) showed that the preincubation of K562 cells with this inhibitor had not effect on cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride induced caspase-3 activation. In summary, cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride displayed a significant cytotoxic effect through cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in K562 cells, which suggests that cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride might have therapeutic potential against leukemia.","['de Lima, Aliny Pereira', 'Pereira, Flavia de Castro', 'Vilanova-Costa, Cesar Augusto Sam Tiago', 'Mello, Francyelli Mariana dos Santos', 'Ribeiro, Alessandra de Santana Braga Barbosa', 'Benfica, Polyana Lopes', 'Valadares, Marize Campos', 'Pavanin, Luiz Alfredo', 'dos Santos, Wagner Batista', 'Lacerda, Elisangela de Paula Silveira']","['de Lima AP', 'Pereira Fde C', 'Vilanova-Costa CA', 'Mello FM', 'Ribeiro Ade S', 'Benfica PL', 'Valadares MC', 'Pavanin LA', 'dos Santos WB', 'Lacerda Ede P']","['Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular e Citogenetica, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Goias-UFG, Goiania, Goias, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100630,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 ((dichloro)tetraammineruthenium(III))', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ruthenium Compounds)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Ruthenium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/16 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(10)00157-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2010.06.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Sep;24(6):1562-8. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2010.06.015.

Although previous studies have focused on identifying protein partners of MEIS1 and its transcriptionally regulated targets, little is known about the upstream transcriptional regulators of this tightly regulated gene. Understanding the regulation of MEIS1 is important to understanding normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we describe our studies focusing on the evolutionary conserved putative MEIS1 promoter region. Phylogenetic sequence analysis and reporter assays in MEIS1-expressing (K562) and nonexpressing (HL60) leukemic cell line models were used to identify key regulatory regions and potential transcription factor binding sites within the candidate promoter region followed by functional and expression studies of one identified regulator in both cell lines and primary human cord blood and leukemia samples. RESULTS: Chromatin status of MEIS1 promoter region is associated with MEIS1 expression. Truncation and mutation studies coupled with reporter assays revealed that a conserved ETS family member binding site located 289 bp upstream of the annotated human MEIS1 transcription start site is required for promoter activity. Of the three ETS family members tested, only ELF1 was enriched on the MEIS1 promoter as assessed by both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in K562. This finding was confirmed in MEIS1-expressing primary human samples. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ELF1 in K562 cells was associated with a decreased MEIS1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the ETS transcription factor ELF1 is an important positive regulator of MEIS1 expression.","['Xiang, Ping', 'Lo, Chaoyu', 'Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Lai, C Benjamin', 'Rouhi, Arefeh', 'Imren, Suzan', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Mager, Dixie', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Xiang P', 'Lo C', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Lai CB', 'Rouhi A', 'Imren S', 'Jiang X', 'Mager D', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100623,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ELF1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Fetal Blood/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00241-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,"Exp Hematol. 2010 Sep;38(9):798-8, 808.e1-2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.06.006.

A large number of hypotheses on the causes of schizophrenia occurred over time. In this review we focus on genetic findings related to potential alterations of intracellular Ca-homeostasis in association with schizophrenia. First, we provide evidence for the NMDA/glutamatergic theory of schizophrenia including calcium processes. We mainly focus on genes including: DAO (D-amino acid oxidase), DAOA (D-amino acid oxidase activator), DTNBP1 (Dysbindin 1, dystrobrevin-binding protein 1), NRG1 (Neuregulin 1), ERBB4 (v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4, avian), NOS1 (nitric oxide synthase 1, neuronal) and NRGN (Neurogranin). Furthermore, a gene coding for a calcium channel subunit (CACNA1C: calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit) is discussed in the light of schizophrenia whereas genetic findings related to alterations in the intracellular Ca-homeostasis associated specifically with dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia are not herein closer reviewed. Taken together there is converging evidence for the contribution of genes potentially related to alterations in intracellular Ca-homeostasis to the risk of schizophrenia. Replications and functional studies will hopefully provide further insight into these genetic variants and the underlying processes.","['Giegling, Ina', 'Genius, Just', 'Benninghoff, Jens', 'Rujescu, Dan']","['Giegling I', 'Genius J', 'Benninghoff J', 'Rujescu D']","['Division of Molecular and Clinical Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Nussbaumstr. 7, 80336 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100701,England,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism/physiology', 'Genetic Linkage/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics/psychology', 'Genotype', 'Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism/physiology', 'Schizophrenia/*genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-5846(10)00235-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.06.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2010 Dec 1;34(8):1375-80. doi: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.06.018.

Here, we investigated the ability of PMEG and PMEDAP to induce telomere shortening and telomerase inhibition at both transcriptional and activity level in T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4. At defined time points (3days and 9weeks), the telomerase activity and relative levels of hTERT and c-myc mRNA were determined using real-time RT-PCR. Telomere length was measured by the flow-FISH method. Both PMEDAP and PMEG induced telomere shortening in CCRF-CEM cells after 9weeks of exposure by 50% and 20%, respectively, without major impairment of telomerase activity. The effect of the tested compounds on telomere length in MOLT-4 cells was the opposite, with telomere elongation by 50% and 40% after 9-week treatment with PMEDAP and PMEG, respectively. At this time point, telomerase activity in MOLT-4 cells appeared to be slightly higher than that of CCRF-CEM cells, nevertheless no correlation between telomerase activity and telomere length was found. Both compounds down-regulated the expression of hTERT and c-myc mRNA in CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells at 72h in a concentration-dependent manner while prolonged exposure to PMEG or PMEDAP for 9weeks had weaker effects. In conclusion, PMEDAP and PMEG are able to modulate telomere length in leukemic cells and this effect is cell-type specific. It is neither due to direct telomerase inhibition nor impairment of hTERT expression and it is likely to be telomerase-independent.","['Hajek, Miroslav', 'Cvilink, Viktor', 'Votruba, Ivan', 'Holy, Antonin', 'Mertlikova-Kaiserova, Helena']","['Hajek M', 'Cvilink V', 'Votruba I', 'Holy A', 'Mertlikova-Kaiserova H']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '114088-58-3 (9-((2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl)guanine)', '5EX1YUR4DH (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Telomere/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(10)00570-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Sep 15;643(1):6-12. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.006.

Notably up-regulated genes are the cell cycle regulators E2F2 and Arl2. In accordance with a function of NSD3L in cell cycle regulation NSD3L depletion resulted in an increase in the number of cells in the S and G2/M cell cycle phases. Moreover, NSD3L depletion increased the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells indicating that NSD3L normally restrain cellular metastatic potential.

To image the 72kDa human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major IE protein (IE1-72K), a recombinant virus encoding IE1 fused with EGFP was constructed. Using this construct, the IE1-EGFP fusion was detected at ND10 (PML-bodies) within 2h post infection (p.i.) and the complete disruption of ND10 imaged through to 6h p.i. HCMV genomes and IE2-86K protein could be detected adjacent to the slowly degrading IE1-72K/ND10 foci. IE1-72K associates with metaphase chromatin, recruiting both PML and STAT2. hDaxx, STAT1 and IE2-86K did not re-locate to metaphase chromatin; the fate of hDaxx is particularly important as this protein contributes to an intrinsic barrier to HCMV infection. While IE1-72K participates in a complex with chromatin, PML, STAT2 and Sp100, IE1-72K releases hDaxx from ND10 yet does not appear to remain associated with it.","['Dimitropoulou, Panagiota', 'Caswell, Richard', 'McSharry, Brian P', 'Greaves, Richard F', 'Spandidos, Demetrios A', 'Wilkinson, Gavin W G', 'Sourvinos, George']","['Dimitropoulou P', 'Caswell R', 'McSharry BP', 'Greaves RF', 'Spandidos DA', 'Wilkinson GW', 'Sourvinos G']","['Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion 71003, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (IE2 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-9335(10)00107-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2010.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2010 Oct;89(10):757-68. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2010.05.006.,,,"['G0700142/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The differentiating effects of such agents can be enhanced in combination with lineage-specific growth factors. We developed a dose finding trial to assess toxicity, differentiating activity, and clinical impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with poor risk myeloid malignancies were eligible to enroll in a dose finding study of continuous infusion bryostatin-1 combined with a fixed dose of daily GM-CSF. Toxicities were graded per NCI CTC version 2.0 and pharmacokinetic and correlative study samples were obtained to assess the combination's clinical and biologic differentiating effects. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were treated with the combination therapy and the dose determined to be most suitable for study in a larger trial was continuous infusion broystatin-1 at 16mug/m(2) for 14 days and subcutaneous GM-CSF at 125mug/m(2) daily for 14 days every 28 days. Arthralgias and myalgias limited further dose escalation. Clinically, the combination impacted differentiation with improvement of absolute neutrophil counts (p=0.0001) in the majority of patients. Interestingly, there were two objective clinical responses, including a CR after a single cycle. Both the bryostatin-1 plasma concentrations and the correlative studies supported biologic activity of the combination at the doses where clinical responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Combining growth factors with pharmacologic differentiating agents may increase their clinical effectiveness and further studies should focus on such combinations.","['Smith, B Douglas', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Cho, Eunpi', 'Kowalski, Jeanne', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Vala, Milada', 'Meade, Brooke', 'Baker, Sharyn D', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Piantadosi, Steven', 'Zhang, Zhe', 'Blumenthal, Gideon', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Brodsky, Robert A', 'Murgo, Anthony', 'Rudek, Michelle A', 'Matsui, William H']","['Smith BD', 'Jones RJ', 'Cho E', 'Kowalski J', 'Karp JE', 'Gore SD', 'Vala M', 'Meade B', 'Baker SD', 'Zhao M', 'Piantadosi S', 'Zhang Z', 'Blumenthal G', 'Warlick ED', 'Brodsky RA', 'Murgo A', 'Rudek MA', 'Matsui WH']","['Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA. bdsmith@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100703,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bryostatins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00290-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Jan;35(1):87-94. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.06.001.

However, when applied to very small RNA samples, such as those obtained from tens or hundreds of cells, this approach leads to high background and low cDNA yield due to concatamerization of the TS oligo. RESULTS: In this study, we describe the application of nucleotide isomers that form non-standard base pairs in the template switching oligo to prevent background cDNA synthesis. When such bases are added to the 5' end of the template switching (TS) oligo, they inhibit MMLV-RT from extending the cDNA beyond the TS oligo, thus increasing cDNA yield by reducing formation of concatamers of the TS oligo that are the source of significant background. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this novel approach for cDNA synthesis has valuable utility for application of ultra-high throughput technologies, such as whole transcriptome sequencing using 454 technology, to very small biological samples comprised of tens of cells as might be obtained via approaches like laser microdissection.","['Kapteyn, Jeremy', 'He, Ruifeng', 'McDowell, Eric T', 'Gang, David R']","['Kapteyn J', 'He R', 'McDowell ET', 'Gang DR']","['School of Plant Sciences and BIO5 Institute, The University of Arizona, 1657 E Helen Street, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100702,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Isomerism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plant Cells', 'Plants/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/09/04 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2009/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-11-413 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-11-413 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2010 Jul 2;11:413. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-11-413.,,,,PMC2996941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such agents would constitute effective adjuvant approaches to traditional chemotherapy regimens. Organosulfur compounds (OSCs), such as diallyl disulfide, have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells. We have previously shown that synthesized relatives of dysoxysulfone, a natural OSC derived from the Fijian medicinal plant, Dysoxylum richi, possess tumor-specific antiproliferative effects and are thus promising lead candidates. METHODS: Because our structure-activity analyses showed that regions flanking the disulfide bond mediated specificity, we synthesized 18 novel OSCs by structural modification of the most promising dysoxysulfone derivatives. These compounds were tested for anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity in both normal and leukemic cells. RESULTS: Six OSCs exhibited tumor-specific killing, having no effect on normal bone marrow, and are thus candidates for future toxicity studies. We then employed mRNA expression profiling to characterize the mechanisms by which different OSCs induce apoptosis. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that each OSC altered a unique set of pathways, and that these differences could be partially rationalized from a transcription factor binding site analysis. For example, five compounds altered genes with a large enrichment of p53 binding sites in their promoter regions (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data establish OSCs derivatized from dysoxysulfone as a novel group of compounds for development as anti-cancer agents.","['Wong, W Wei-Lynn', 'Boutros, Paul C', 'Wasylishen, Amanda R', 'Guckert, Kristal D', ""O'Brien, Erin M"", 'Griffiths, Rebecca', 'Martirosyan, Anna R', 'Bros, Christina', 'Jurisica, Igor', 'Langler, Richard F', 'Penn, Linda Z']","['Wong WW', 'Boutros PC', 'Wasylishen AR', 'Guckert KD', ""O'Brien EM"", 'Griffiths R', 'Martirosyan AR', 'Bros C', 'Jurisica I', 'Langler RF', 'Penn LZ']","['Division of Cancer Genomics and Proteomics, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto M5G2M1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100702,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfones)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disulfides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfones/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-351 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-351 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Jul 2;10:351. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-351.,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC2928001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community. RESULTS: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications.

We have previously shown that neuroprotection and neuromodulation mediated by IL-6 require neuronal adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1) R) function. We now have investigated whether two other IL-6-type cytokines [oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)] use a similar mechanism. It is presented here that OSM but not LIF, enhanced the expression of A(1) Rs (both mRNA and protein levels) in cultured neurons. Whereas the neuroprotective effect of LIF was unchanged in A(1) R deficient neurons, OSM failed to protect neurons in the absence of A(1) R. In addition, OSM pre-treatment for 4 h potentiated the A(1) R-mediated inhibition of electrically evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents recorded from hippocampal slices either under normal or hypoxic conditions. No such effect was observed after LIF pre-treatment. Our findings thus strongly suggest that, despite known structural and functional similarities, OSM and LIF use different mechanisms to achieve neuroprotection and neuromodulation.","['Moidunny, Shamsudheen', 'Dias, Raquel Baptista', 'Wesseling, Evelyn', 'Sekino, Yuko', 'Boddeke, Hendrikus W G M', 'Sebastiao, Ana Maria', 'Biber, Knut']","['Moidunny S', 'Dias RB', 'Wesseling E', 'Sekino Y', 'Boddeke HW', 'Sebastiao AM', 'Biber K']","['Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG), Groningen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100819,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials', 'Hippocampus/cytology/physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, Adenosine A1/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Synaptic Transmission']",2010/07/06 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JNC6881 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06881.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2010 Sep;114(6):1667-77. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06881.x.

In chronic phase CML, the neoplastic clone exhibits multilineage differentiation and maturation capacity. The BCR/ABL1 kinase blocker imatinib shows major antileukaemic effects in most patients and is considered standard frontline therapy. However, not all patients have a long-lasting response to imatinib. Notably, resistance to imatinib has been recognised as an emerging problem and challenge in CML. Whereas CML stem cells are considered to exhibit intrinsic resistance, acquired resistance may, in addition, develop in subclones over time, resulting in an overt relapse. A key trigger of resistance in subclones are BCR/ABL1 mutations. For such patients, novel multikinase inhibitors such as nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib or bafetinib, which block the kinase activity of various BCR/ABL1 mutants, have been developed and reportedly exert antileukaemic effects in drug-resistant cells. For highly resistant patients, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an alternative option. Treatment decisions and the selection of drugs are based on the presence and type of BCR/ABL1 mutation(s), phase of disease, other disease-related variables and patient-related factors including age, compliance and co-morbidity. The current review provides an overview on standards in the diagnosis and therapy in CML, with special reference to novel BCR/ABL1 inhibitors.","['Valent, Peter']",['Valent P'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Haematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100819,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",2010/07/06 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/07/06 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ECI2328 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02328.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2010 Oct;40(10):918-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02328.x.

Recently, adipose tissue (AT) and Wharton's jelly (WJ) have been reported as potential alternative MSC sources to bone marrow (BM). In this study, we investigated the capacity of MSCs derived from AT and WJ to modulate lymphocyte proliferation as well as their impact on regulatory T-cells. We also evaluated MSC expression of leukemia inhibitory factor and the role of this molecule in the mechanism of MSC-mediated inhibition. We demonstrated that WJ- and AT-MSCs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of T-cell proliferation regardless of the stimuli used to activate T-cells. WJ- and AT-MSCs were more potent than BM-MSCs in suppressing lymphocyte responses, and they mediated this effect by secreting high levels of leukemia inhibitory factor. We also observed that WJ- and AT-MSCs maintained and promoted the expansion of regulatory T-cells independently of the MSC/T-cell ratio. Because human WJ and AT contain MSCs with potent immunomodulatory capacities, they could represent an alternative to BM. Using WJ- and AT-MSCs in clinical therapies, such as the prevention and/or reduction of graft-versus-host disease and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, is particularly promising. Further characterization of MSC physiological functions will increase the safety and efficacy of their use in clinical settings.","['Najar, Mehdi', 'Raicevic, Gordana', 'Boufker, Hicham Id', 'Fayyad-Kazan, Hussein', 'De Bruyn, Cecile', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Toungouz, Michel', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Najar M', 'Raicevic G', 'Boufker HI', 'Fayyad-Kazan H', 'De Bruyn C', 'Meuleman N', 'Bron D', 'Toungouz M', 'Lagneaux L']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. mnajar@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100830,United States,Tissue Eng Part A,Tissue engineering.

The corresponding HRs for resected patients were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.46-0.95) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.40-0.89) relative to the lowest VO(2peak) category (P(trend) = .0247), respectively. For nonresected patients, the HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.34-1.79) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.16-0.94) relative to the lowest category (P(trend) = .0278). CONCLUSIONS: VO(2peak) is a strong independent predictor of survival in NSCLC that may complement traditional markers of prognosis to improve risk stratification and prognostication.","['Jones, Lee W', 'Watson, Dorothy', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Eves, Neil D', 'Haithcock, Benjamin E', 'Loewen, Gregory', 'Kohman, Leslie']","['Jones LW', 'Watson D', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Eves ND', 'Haithcock BE', 'Loewen G', 'Kohman L']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. lee.w.jones@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Cause of Death', 'Exercise Test/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oxygen Consumption', 'Preoperative Period']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25396 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Oct 15;116(20):4825-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25396.,,,"['U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5399980,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS854403'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, purine analogues (pentostatin and cladribine) changed radically the treatment modality, inducing complete and durable responses in the majority of patients. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of different lines of therapy in 121 HCL patients followed in their institute from 1986 to 2008, with a median follow-up of 105 months. Patients were divided into subgroups according to the number of treatments; Group A included 121 patients who underwent a front-line therapy, Group B patients (n =53) were treated with 2 lines, Group C patients (n = 34) with 3 lines, Group D patients (n = 17) with 4 lines, and Group E patients (n = 8) with 5 lines. RESULTS: In Group A, 92 (77%) patients obtained a complete response (CR), 23 (18%) a partial response, and the remaining 6 (5%) a minor or no response; median duration of response was 2.7 years. In Group B, 53 relapsed patients achieved a second CR rate of 73.5%; median duration of response was 2.5 years. Group C contained 34 patients in a second relapse, with a CR rate after the third line of treatment of 70.5% (median duration of response, 2.2 years). In Group D, 11 (64.7%) patients obtained a CR (median duration of response, 1.6 years), and in Group E 4 (50%) of 8 patients achieved a CR (median duration of response, 1.3 years). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the high risk (>40% of all patients) of retreatment of HCL patients and the need to maximize primary response.","['Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Pellegrini, Cinzia', 'Stefoni, Vittorio', 'Derenzini, Enrico', 'Gandolfi, Letizia', 'Broccoli, Alessandro', 'Argnani, Lisa', 'Quirini, Federica', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Zinzani PL', 'Pellegrini C', 'Stefoni V', 'Derenzini E', 'Gandolfi L', 'Broccoli A', 'Argnani L', 'Quirini F', 'Pileri S', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""L. e A.

The mitochondrial DNA of all the cells above was amplified by PCR, directly sequenced and analyzed by Sequence Navigatore and Factura software. The apoptosis rates were assayed by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial DNA mutation in the D-loop region was found in NB4 and APL cells before As(2)O(3) use, but the mutation spots were remarkably increased after As(2)O(3) treatment, which was positively correlated to the rates of cellular apoptosis, the correlation coefficient: r (NB4-As2O3)=0.973818, and r (APL-As2O3)=0.934703. The mutation types include transition, transversion, codon insertion or deletion, and the mutation spots in all samples were not constant and regular. It is revealed that As(2)O(3) aggravates mtDNA mutation in the D-loop region of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo.

This paradigm is challenged, however, in stem cell research and application. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) culture system, here we show that the expression level of many key stem cell marker genes/transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog failed to monitor cell status transition during mESC differentiation. On the other hand, the response patterns of cell signalling network to external stimuli, as monitored by the dynamics of protein phosphorylation, changed dramatically. Our results also suggest that an irreversible alternation in cell signalling network precedes the adjustment of transcription factor levels. This is consistent with the notion that signal transduction events regulate cell fate specification. We propose that interrogating cell signalling network can assess the cell property more precisely, and provide a sensitive measurement for the early events in cell fate transition.

Due to the frequent expression of these genes in breast cancer cells, the clinical efficacy of Imatinib has recently been investigated in patients with advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Here, we have studied the effects of Imatinib on human MA-11 breast carcinoma cells, expressing both c-abl and PDGFRbeta, in vitro and in mouse xenografts. METHODS: The effects of Imatinib mesylate on the human MA-11 breast carcinoma cell line were studied in vitro and in xenografts. RESULTS: Daily intraperitoneal treatment with 60 mg/kg Imatinib for 9 days of athymic nude mice pre-implanted subcutaneously with MA-11 cells did not result in an anti-tumor effect, but rather increased the take rate of 3 x 10(4) cells from 30.8 to 84.6% and caused the appearance of large abdominal masses in 30% of mice. To investigate the mechanism(s) of the observed effects of Imatinib on MA-11 tumors, we exposed the cells in vitro to Imatinib for 9 days. The surviving population, expanded in culture, showed increased motility and over-expressed a set of genes associated with aggressive behavior. Also, several genes belonging to the Wnt and the MAPK pathway were differentially expressed. In promoter activation assays, Imatinib increased the promoter activity driven by both Wnt and MAPK/ERK-1/2. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest caution in the clinical use of Imatinib in breast cancer patients; the comparison of Imatinib-surviving breast cancer cells with parental cells may help define the regulatory pathways involved in the increased malignancy of residual tumor cells that survive therapy, ultimately providing important therapeutic targets.","['Rappa, Germana', 'Anzanello, Fabio', 'Lorico, Aurelio']","['Rappa G', 'Anzanello F', 'Lorico A']","['Department of Drug Development, Nevada Cancer Institute, One Breakthrough Way, Las Vegas, NV 89135, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100702,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/07/03 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-010-1394-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2011 Apr;67(4):919-26. doi: 10.1007/s00280-010-1394-x.

The Ikaros protein contains two separate regions of zinc-finger domains: 4 DNA-binding zinc fingers near the N-terminus and 2 zinc fingers for protein-protein interactions near the C-terminus. Here, we identified the Ikaros gene from 14 vertebrate genomes and found Ikaros existed in all kinds of vertebrate including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. Moreover, except rat and Xenopus tropicalis Ikaros proteins, which lack the first C2H2-type 1 Zinc finger region, all identified Ikaros proteins contain six C2H2-type 1 Zinc finger regions. We found human Ikaros gene showed a predominant expression in the liver, lymph node, thymus, intestine, lung, mammary gland, bone marrow, brain, heart, placenta and prostate. Moreover, four available SNPs disrupted an existing exonic splicing enhancer were identified in Ikaros. Besides the reported acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the expression of Ikaros was related to the prognosis of 13 cases of cancers including blood cancers, breast, lung, ovarian and skin cancer. Moreover, the relationship between the expression of Ikaros and prognosis varied in different cancers, even in the same cancer from different database. Two tumor-related transcriptional factor (c-Fos and Elk-1) binding sites were identified within the 1.5-kb regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of human Ikaros, which may be involved in the effect of Ikaros in tumors.","['Yang, Liming', 'Luo, Yuming', 'Wei, Jifu']","['Yang L', 'Luo Y', 'Wei J']","[""School of Life Sciences, Huaiyin Normal University, Huai'an 223300, PR China. yanglm@hytc.edu.cn or""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amphibians/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Birds/genetics', 'Fishes/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mammals/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Systems Integration']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or_00000894 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2010 Aug;24(2):571-7. doi: 10.3892/or_00000894.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we found that subpopulations with elevated ALDH1 were present in the human sarcoma cell lines, MG63 (osteosarcoma) and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), using Aldefluor assay. Both ALDH1 positive and negative cell populations were isolated from the MG63 cell line, by cell-sorting using FACSAria. Both subpopulations had a comparable ability to differentiate similarly to the parental MG63, under normal monolayer culture condition. Subpopulations with the ability to form spheres in anchorage-independent, serum-starved conditions showed increased ALDH1 mRNA expression in addition to strong mRNA expression of the stem cell-related genes, such as Nanog, Oct3/4, Stat3 and Sox2, and possessed ability for self-renewal with secondary sphere formation. Sarcosphere cells from the MG63 cell line showed strong chemo-resistance against both doxorubicin and cisplatin compared with monolayer, adherent cells. In conclusion, sphere-forming cells with elevated ALDH1 are a possible candidate for sarcoma stem cells, possessing strong chemo-resistant capacities. Although ALDH1 elevation was not sufficient for representing sarcoma stem cells, the efficient detoxification could contribute to the chemo-resistant properties of the stem-like sphere cells form human sarcoma.","['Honoki, Kanya', 'Fujii, Hiromasa', 'Kubo, Atsushi', 'Kido, Akira', 'Mori, Toshio', 'Tanaka, Yasuhito', 'Tsujiuchi, Toshifumi']","['Honoki K', 'Fujii H', 'Kubo A', 'Kido A', 'Mori T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tsujiuchi T']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara 634-8521, Japan. kahonoki@naramed-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or_00000885 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2010 Aug;24(2):501-5. doi: 10.3892/or_00000885.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is one of the common naturally occurring isothiocyanates. Recent studies have shown that AITC significantly inhibited survival of leukemia HL-60, bladder cancer UM-UC-3 and colon cancer HT-29 cells in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that AITC significantly decreased proliferation and viability of human brain malignant glioma GBM 8401 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 9.25+/-0.69 microM for 24 h-treatment. The analysis of cell cycle distribution also showed that AITC induced significantly G2/M arrest and sub-G1 phase (apoptotic population) in GBM 8401 cells. AITC markedly reduced the CDK1/cyclin B activity and protein levels by CDK1 activity assay and Western blot analysis. AITC-induced apoptotic cell death and this evidence was confirmed by morphological assessment and DAPI staining. Pretreatment with specific inhibitors of caspase-3 (Z-DEVE-FMK) and -9 (Z-LEHD-FMK) significantly reduced caspase-3 and -9 activity in GBM 8401 cells. Western blot analysis and colorimetric assays also displayed that AITC caused a time-dependent increase in cytosolic cytochrome c, pro-caspase-9, Apaf-1, AIF, Endo G and the stimulated caspase-9 and -3 activity. Our results suggest that AITC is a potent anti-human brain malignant glioma drug and it shows a remarkable action on cell cycle arrest before commitment for apoptosis is reached.","['Chen, Nian-Gu', 'Chen, Kuan-Tin', 'Lu, Chi-Cheng', 'Lan, Yu-Hsuan', 'Lai, Cheng-Hung', 'Chung, Yang-Tsung', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Lin, Yung-Chang']","['Chen NG', 'Chen KT', 'Lu CC', 'Lan YH', 'Lai CH', 'Chung YT', 'Yang JS', 'Lin YC']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', 'BN34FX42G3 (allyl isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytostatic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Glioma/metabolism/*pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or_00000878 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2010 Aug;24(2):449-55. doi: 10.3892/or_00000878.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of CD22 is limited to B-cells, and we show that CD22 is expressed on the vast majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). An ideal target for an ADC for the treatment of NHL would have limited expression outside the B-cell compartment and be highly effective against NHL. We generated an ADC consisting of a humanized anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to the anti-mitotic agent maytansine with a stable linker (anti-CD22-MCC-DM1). Anti-CD22-MCC-DM1 was broadly effective in in vitro killing assays on NHL B-cell lines. We did not find a strong correlation between in vitro potency and CD22 surface expression, internalization of ADC or sensitivity to free drug. We show that anti-CD22-MCC-DM1 was capable of inducing complete tumor regression in NHL xenograft mouse models. Further, anti-CD22-MCC-DM1 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys and substantially decreased circulating B-cells as well as follicle size and germinal center formation in lymphoid organs. These results suggest that anti-CD22-MCC-DM1 has an efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic profile that support its use as a treatment for NHL.","['Polson, A G', 'Williams, M', 'Gray, A M', 'Fuji, R N', 'Poon, K A', 'McBride, J', 'Raab, H', 'Januario, T', 'Go, M', 'Lau, J', 'Yu, S-F', 'Du, C', 'Fuh, F', 'Tan, C', 'Wu, Y', 'Liang, W-C', 'Prabhu, S', 'Stephan, J-P', 'Hongo, J-A', 'Dere, R C', 'Deng, R', 'Cullen, M', 'de Tute, R', 'Bennett, F', 'Rawstron, A', 'Jack, A', 'Ebens, A']","['Polson AG', 'Williams M', 'Gray AM', 'Fuji RN', 'Poon KA', 'McBride J', 'Raab H', 'Januario T', 'Go M', 'Lau J', 'Yu SF', 'Du C', 'Fuh F', 'Tan C', 'Wu Y', 'Liang WC', 'Prabhu S', 'Stephan JP', 'Hongo JA', 'Dere RC', 'Deng R', 'Cullen M', 'de Tute R', 'Bennett F', 'Rawstron A', 'Jack A', 'Ebens A']","['Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. polson@gene.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100701,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010141 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1566-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.141.

However, development of resistance to imatinib has emerged as an important clinical problem for molecular-targeted therapy in CML and CEL. In this study, we have established the imatinib-resistant CEL EOL-1 sub-lines (designated as EOL-1R) by culturing cells with increasing concentrations of imatinib for 6 months. Interestingly, EOL-1R cells showed epigenetic silencing of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene. Exposure of EOL-1R cells to imatinib failed to dephosphorylate AKT, ERK and STAT5, although PDGFRalpha was effectively inactivated. The forced expression of PTEN negatively regulated these signal pathways and sensitized EOL-1R cells to imatinib. Notably, hypermethylation of the promoter region of the PTEN gene in association with the downregulation of this gene's transcripts was identified in imatinib-resistant leukemia cells isolated from individuals with CEL, CML and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition, anti-epigenetic agents restored PTEN expression, resulting in the sensitization of EOL-1R cells to imatinib. Taken together, epigenetic silence of PTEN is one of the mechanisms that cause drug resistance in individuals with leukemia after exposure to imatinib. Anti-epigenetic agents may be useful for overcoming drug resistance in such a case.","['Nishioka, C', 'Ikezoe, T', 'Yang, J', 'Yokoyama, A']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100701,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010145 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.145 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1631-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.145.

The potential risk is that the tissue might harbor malignant cells that could induce disease recurrence. We therefore decided to evaluate the presence of leukemic cells in cryopreserved ovarian tissue from 18 leukemic patients: 6 with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 12 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In each case, histology, quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and long-term (6 months) xenografting to immunodeficient mice were used. Histology did not identify any malignant cells in the ovarian tissue. By quantitative RT-PCR, 2 of 6 CML patients were positive for BCR-ABL in their ovarian tissue. Among the 12 ALL patients, 7 of the 10 with available molecular markers showed positive leukemic markers in their ovarian tissue (translocations or rearrangement genes). Four mice grafted with ovarian tissue from ALL patients developed intraperitoneal leukemic masses. In conclusion, this study demonstrates, by quantitative RT-PCR, ovarian contamination by malignant cells in acute as well as chronic leukemia, whereas histology fails to do so. Moreover, chemotherapy before ovarian cryopreservation does not exclude malignant contamination. Finally, reimplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue from ALL and CML patients puts them at risk of disease recurrence.","['Dolmans, Marie-Madeleine', 'Marinescu, Cristina', 'Saussoy, Pascale', 'Van Langendonckt, Anne', 'Amorim, Christiani', 'Donnez, Jacques']","['Dolmans MM', 'Marinescu C', 'Saussoy P', 'Van Langendonckt A', 'Amorim C', 'Donnez J']","['Department of Gynecology, GYNE Research Unit, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100701,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/pathology', 'Ovary/*pathology/*transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31217-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-265751 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2908-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-265751.

Conditioning was fludarabine/ cyclophosphamide-based. Longitudinal quantitative monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) was performed centrally by MRD-flow or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. One hundred eligible patients were enrolled, and 90 patients proceeded to alloSCT. With a median follow-up of 46 months (7-102 months), 4-year nonrelapse mortality, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 23%, 42%, and 65%, respectively. Of 52 patients with MRD monitoring available, 27 (52%) were alive and MRD negative at 12 months after transplant. Four-year EFS of this subset was 89% with all event-free patients except for 2 being MRD negative at the most recent assessment. EFS was similar for all genetic subsets, including 17p deletion (17p-). In multivariate analyses, uncontrolled disease at alloSCT and in vivo T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab, but not 17p-, previous purine analogue refractoriness, or donor source (human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings or unrelated donors) had an adverse impact on EFS and OS. In conclusion, alloSCT for poor-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia can result in long-term MRD-negative survival in up to one-half of the patients independent of the underlying genomic risk profile.

We previously identified aberrant expression of the Wnt pathway transcription factor and target gene lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF1) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This suggested that the Wnt signaling pathway has a role in the biology of CLL. In this study, we performed a Wnt pathway analysis using gene expression profiling and identified aberrant regulation of Wnt pathway target genes, ligands, and signaling members in CLL cells. Furthermore, we identified aberrant protein expression of LEF-1 specifically in CLL but not in normal mature B-cell subsets or after B-cell activation. Using the T cell-specific transcription factor/LEF (TCF/LEF) dual luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated constitutive Wnt pathway activation in CLL, although the pathway was inactive in normal peripheral B cells. Importantly, LEF-1 knockdown decreased CLL B-cell survival. We also identified LEF-1 expression in CD19(+)/CD5(+) cells obtained from patients with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, suggesting a role for LEF-1 early in CLL leukemogenesis. This study has identified the constitutive activation and prosurvival function of LEF-1 and the Wnt pathway in CLL and uncovered a possible role for these factors in the preleukemic state of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis.","['Gutierrez, Albert Jr', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Wu, Xiaosheng', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Eckel-Passow, Jeanette', 'Huddleston, Paul M 3rd', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Jelinek, Diane F']","['Gutierrez A Jr', 'Tschumper RC', 'Wu X', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Eckel-Passow J', 'Huddleston PM 3rd', 'Slager SL', 'Kay NE', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100701,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31225-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-269878 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2975-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-269878.

Here, we generated RapGEF2 conditional knockout mice and studied its role in embryogenesis and fetal as well as adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulation. RapGEF2 deficiency led to embryonic lethality at ~ E11.5 due to severe yolk sac vascular defects. However, a similar number of Flk1(+) cells were present in RapGEF2(+/+) and RapGEF2(-/-) yolk sacs indicating that the bipotential early progenitors were in fact generated in the absence of RapGEF2. Further analysis of yolk sacs and embryos revealed a significant reduction of CD41 expressing cells in RapGEF2(-/-) genotype, suggesting a defect in the maintenance of definitive hematopoiesis. RapGEF2(-/-) cells displayed defects in proliferation and migration, and the in vitro colony formation ability of hematopoietic progenitors was also impaired. At the molecular level, Rap1 activation was impaired in RapGEF2(-/-) cells that in turn lead to defective B-raf/ERK signaling. Scl/Gata transcription factor expression was significantly reduced, indicating that the defects observed in RapGEF2(-/-) cells could be mediated through Scl/Gata deregulation. Inducible deletion of RapGEF2 during late embryogenesis in RapGEF2(cko/cko)ER(cre) mice leads to defective fetal liver erythropoiesis. Conversely, inducible deletion in the adult bone marrow, or specific deletion in B cells, T cells, HSCs, and endothelial cells has no impact on hematopoiesis.","['Satyanarayana, Ande', 'Gudmundsson, Kristbjorn Orri', 'Chen, Xiu', 'Coppola, Vincenzo', 'Tessarollo, Lino', 'Keller, Jonathan R', 'Hou, Steven X']","['Satyanarayana A', 'Gudmundsson KO', 'Chen X', 'Coppola V', 'Tessarollo L', 'Keller JR', 'Hou SX']","['Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100701,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CNrasGEF protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA Transcription Factors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/abnormalities/metabolism/*physiology', 'GATA Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Liver/embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Yolk Sac/abnormalities/blood supply/metabolism']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31219-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-262964 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2921-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-262964.

DESIGN AND METHODS: For this repeated measures clinical trial at a university hospital in Norway, 145 patients starting treatment for leukemia or lymphoma were randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=75) or control group (n=70). Both groups used the ITPA for symptom assessments prior to inpatient and outpatient visits for up to one year. The assessment summary, which displayed patients' self-reported symptoms, problems, and distress in rank-order of the patient's need for support, was provided to physicians and nurses in the intervention group only but not in the control group. RESULTS: Significantly more symptoms were addressed in the intervention group patient charts versus those of the control group. Symptom distress in the intervention group decreased significantly over time in 11 (58%) of 19 symptom/problem categories versus 2 (10%) for the control group. Need for symptom management support over time also decreased significantly more for the intervention group than the control group in 13 (68%) symptom categories. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that an ITPA used in an interdisciplinary oncology practice can significantly improve patient-centered care and patient outcomes, including reduced symptom distress and reduced need for symptom management support.","['Ruland, Cornelia M', 'Holte, Harald H', 'Roislien, Jo', 'Heaven, Cathy', 'Hamilton, Glenys A', 'Kristiansen, Jorn', 'Sandbaek, Heidi', 'Kvaloy, Stein O', 'Hasund, Line', 'Ellison, Misoo C']","['Ruland CM', 'Holte HH', 'Roislien J', 'Heaven C', 'Hamilton GA', 'Kristiansen J', 'Sandbaek H', 'Kvaloy SO', 'Hasund L', 'Ellison MC']","['Center for Shared Decision Making and Nursing Research, Rikshospitalet, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. cornelia.ruland@rr-research.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Am Med Inform Assoc,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,,IM,"['Adult', 'Depression/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/nursing/psychology/*therapy', 'Linear Models', 'Lymphoma/nursing/psychology/*therapy', 'Norway', 'Patient-Centered Care', '*Quality of Life', 'Single-Blind Method', '*Social Support', '*Therapy, Computer-Assisted', '*User-Computer Interface']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['17/4/403 [pii]', '10.1136/jamia.2010.005660 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2010 Jul-Aug;17(4):403-10. doi: 10.1136/jamia.2010.005660.,,,,PMC2995659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that p53 inactivation strongly cooperates with oncogenic Kras(G12D) to induce aggressive AML, while both lesions on their own induce T-cell malignancies with long latency. This synergy is based on a pivotal role of p53 in limiting aberrant self-renewal of myeloid progenitor cells, such that loss of p53 counters the deleterious effects of oncogenic Kras on these cells and enables them to self-renew indefinitely. Consequently, myeloid progenitor cells expressing oncogenic Kras and lacking p53 become leukemia-initiating cells, resembling cancer stem cells capable of maintaining AML in vivo. Our results establish an efficient new strategy for interrogating oncogene cooperation, and provide strong evidence that the ability of p53 to limit aberrant self-renewal contributes to its tumor suppressor activity.","['Zhao, Zhen', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Diaz-Flores, Ernesto', 'Lintault, Laura', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Zhao Z', 'Zuber J', 'Diaz-Flores E', 'Lintault L', 'Kogan SC', 'Shannon K', 'Lowe SW']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Integrases/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['24/13/1389 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1940710 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2010 Jul 1;24(13):1389-402. doi: 10.1101/gad.1940710.,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA072614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R37 CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2895198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism underlying fucoxanthin-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the effect of fucoxanthin induction on the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and on the triggering of Bcl-xL signaling pathway in HL-60 cells. We determined that ROS are generated during fucoxanthin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells, and that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, suppressed fucoxanthin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Moreover, fucoxanthin-induced the cleavage of caspases -3 and -7, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and a decrease of Bcl-xL levels, whereas NAC pre-treatment significantly inhibited caspase-3, -7, and PARP cleavage and the reduction in Bcl-xL levels.

METHODS: We examined associations of adult BMI with cancer mortality (overall and for 20 cancer sites) in geographic populations from Asia and from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), within the Asia-Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration, by use of Cox regression analysis. Pooled data from 39 cohorts (recruitment 1961-99, median follow-up 4 years) were analysed for 424,519 participants (77% Asian; 41% female; mean recruitment age 48 years) with individual data on BMI. FINDINGS: After excluding those with follow-up of less than 3 years, 4872 cancer deaths occurred in 401,215 participants. Hazard ratios for cancer sites with increased mortality risk in obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) compared with normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) were: 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.36) for all-cause cancer (excluding lung and upper aerodigestive tract), 1.50 (1.13-1.99) for colon, 1.68 (1.06-2.67) for rectum, 1.63 (1.13-2.35) for breast in women 60 years or older, 2.62 (1.57-4.37) for ovary, 4.21 (1.89-9.39) for cervix, 1.45 (0.97-2.19) for prostate, and 1.66 (1.03-2.68) for leukaemia (all after left censoring at 3 years). The increased risk associated with a 5-unit increase in BMI for those with BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2) or higher was 1.09 (95% CI 1.04-1.14) for all cancers (excluding lung and upper aerodigestive tract). There was little evidence of regional differences in relative risk of cancer with higher BMI, apart from cancers of the oropharynx and larynx, where the association was inverse in ANZ and absent in Asia. INTERPRETATION: Overweight and obese individuals in populations across the Asia-Pacific region have a significantly increased risk of mortality from cancer. Strategies to prevent individuals from becoming overweight and obese in Asia are needed to reduce the burden of cancer that is expected if the obesity epidemic continues.

To investigate the association of XMRV with CFS we tested blood specimens from 51 persons with CFS and 56 healthy persons from the US for evidence of XMRV infection by using serologic and molecular assays. Blinded PCR and serologic testing were performed at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and at two additional laboratories. RESULTS: Archived blood specimens were tested from persons with CFS defined by the 1994 international research case definition and matched healthy controls from Wichita, Kansas and metropolitan, urban, and rural Georgia populations. Serologic testing at CDC utilized a Western blot (WB) assay that showed excellent sensitivity to MuLV and XMRV polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, and no reactivity on sera from 121 US blood donors or 26 HTLV-and HIV-infected sera. Plasma from 51 CFS cases and plasma from 53 controls were all WB negative. Additional blinded screening of the 51 cases and 53 controls at the Robert Koch Institute using an ELISA employing recombinant Gag and Env XMRV proteins identified weak seroreactivity in one CFS case and a healthy control, which was not confirmed by immunofluorescence. PCR testing at CDC employed a gag and a pol nested PCR assay with a detection threshold of 10 copies in 1 ug of human DNA. DNA specimens from 50 CFS patients and 56 controls and 41 US blood donors were all PCR-negative. Blinded testing by a second nested gag PCR assay at the Blood Systems Research Institute was also negative for DNA specimens from the 50 CFS cases and 56 controls. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any evidence of infection with XMRV in our U.S. study population of CFS patients or healthy controls by using multiple molecular and serologic assays. These data do not support an association of XMRV with CFS.","['Switzer, William M', 'Jia, Hongwei', 'Hohn, Oliver', 'Zheng, HaoQiang', 'Tang, Shaohua', 'Shankar, Anupama', 'Bannert, Norbert', 'Simmons, Graham', 'Hendry, R Michael', 'Falkenberg, Virginia R', 'Reeves, William C', 'Heneine, Walid']","['Switzer WM', 'Jia H', 'Hohn O', 'Zheng H', 'Tang S', 'Shankar A', 'Bannert N', 'Simmons G', 'Hendry RM', 'Falkenberg VR', 'Reeves WC', 'Heneine W']","['Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. bswitzer@cdc.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100701,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blood/*virology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*etiology/*virology', 'Female', 'Gammaretrovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Georgia', 'Humans', 'Kansas', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-7-57 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-7-57 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2010 Jul 1;7:57. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-7-57.,,,,PMC2908559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CXCR4 has also been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including leukemia and breast cancer, and recent evidence has highlighted the role of CXCR4 in prostate cancer. Furthermore, CXCR4 expression is upregulated in cancer metastasis, leading to enhanced signaling. These observations suggest that CXCR4 is important for the progression of cancer. The CXCR4-CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)) axis has additionally been identified to have a role in normal stem cell homing. Interestingly, cancer stem cells also express CXCR4, indicating that the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis may direct the trafficking and metastasis of these cells to organs that express high levels of SDF-1, such as the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone.

NF-kappaB signaling pathway is constitutively activated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphomas and in multiple myeloma (MM). Inactive NF-kappaB is bound in the cytoplasm to its inhibitor IkappaB, which masks its nuclear localisation signal. Two protein kinases with a high degree of sequence similarity, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, mediate phosphorylation of IkappaB proteins and represent a convergence point for most signal transduction pathways leading to NF-kappaB activation. The overexpression of NF-kappaB and its anti-apoptotic cytoprotective effect suggest that it might be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Several drugs effective for the treatment of MM, including proteasome inhibitors, thalidomide, lenalidomide and arsenic trioxide, block NF-kappaB activation. New agents with NF-kappaB inhibitory activity enhance the anti-MM effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and reduce different side-effects. Triptolide (diterpenoid triepoxyde), a purified component of a traditional Chinese medicine, extracted from a shrub-like vine named Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF) inhibits transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and downregulates the expression of various NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Triptolide (10-80 ng/ml) induces apoptosis of MM cells and effectively inhibits cell growth of MM cells. NF-kappaB activation can be also inhibited by IKKbeta-selective inhibitors, PS-1145dihydrochloride, MLN120B (both Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) and BMS-345541 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ).

Further, RIZ1 expression led to the augmentation of p53 expression and the silencing of RIZ1 prevented it. On the other hand, a p53 inhibitor enhanced the TNF-alpha-induced RIZ1 expression. Silencing of RIZ1 augmented the proliferative activity of TNF-alpha-treated cells. Therefore, it is suggested that RIZ1 negatively regulated the cell proliferation of monocytic leukemia cells via activation of p53.","['Shadat, Noman Mohammod Abu', 'Koide, Naoki', 'Khuda, Imtiaz I-E', 'Dagvadorj, Jargalsaikhan', 'Tumurkhuu, Gantsetseg', 'Naiki, Yoshikazu', 'Komatsu, Takayuki', 'Yoshida, Tomoaki', 'Yokochi, Takashi']","['Shadat NM', 'Koide N', 'Khuda II', 'Dagvadorj J', 'Tumurkhuu G', 'Naiki Y', 'Komatsu T', 'Yoshida T', 'Yokochi T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 480-1195, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (PRDM2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/drug effects/*metabolism']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07357907.2010.494323 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2010 Oct;28(8):806-12. doi: 10.3109/07357907.2010.494323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Subjects were recruited from patients attending the outpatient clinics or hospitalised in the ward of the Hematology Department of Yuzuncu Yil University Hospital. Venous blood samples were taken from a total of 67 individuals (31 with acute leukemia and 36 healthy) included in the study. CAT enzyme activity was determined in erythrocytes using Aebi's method and CA by hydration of CO2. RESULTS: CAT activity was found to be significantly decreased (P<0.001) on average in acute leukemia cases as compared to the control group while erythrocyte CA activity was significantly increased (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to malfunction of the antioxidant system in acute leukemia patients. Hence we need to investigation the cause and also its possible contribution to prognosis. Furthermore, clarification of the relationship between the antioxidant system and CA inhibitors in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia appears warranted.","['Demir, Cengiz', 'Demir, Halit', 'Esen, Ramazan', 'Atmaca, Murat', 'Tagdemir, Eyup']","['Demir C', 'Demir H', 'Esen R', 'Atmaca M', 'Tagdemir E']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey. drcengizdemir@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antioxidants)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/*blood', 'Catalase/*blood', 'Erythrocytes/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/*enzymology', 'Male']",2010/07/03 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/07/03 06:00'],"['2010/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2010;11(1):247-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Febrile neutropenic attacks without complications can be successfully treated with wide-spectrum anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins or carbapenems. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy and safety of meropenem in the treatment of febrile neutropenia (FN) in children with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four patients who had a febrile neutropenic episodes followed by initiation of empirical meropenem therapy were included in the study. RESULTS: Of all the patients, 13 (54.2%) had solid tumors, while 11 (45.8%) were diagnosed to have acute leukemia. Among all, 7 (29.2%) and 15 (62.5%) infections were identified microbiologically and clinically, respectively. Fever of unknown origin was observed in 2 (8.3%) patients. The mean duration of neutropenia was 7.2 +/- 3.1 (4-14) days in patients with solid tumors, and 9.3 +/- 4.7 (2-17) days in the group with leukemia. This difference was not statistically significant (log rank, p=0.063). Average time of stay in hospital was 10.1 +/- 6.4 (4-21) days for patients with solid tumors, and 15.9 +/- 11.7 (5-37) days for patients with leukemia (log rank, p=0.041). FN duration was observed to be significantly longer in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 100/mm3 and even those with an ANC of less than 200/mm3, and in children who were not in remission for the underlying malign disease (p<0.05). While 22 (91.7%) of the patients were discharged from the hospital, 2 (8.3%) died. The success rate of empirical therapy started with meropenem was 87.5%.

HTLV-1 protease consists of 125 amino acid residues and functions as a homodimer stabilized in part by a four-stranded beta-sheet comprising the N- and C-termini. Compared with many other viral proteases such as HIV-1 protease, HTLV-1 protease is elongated by an extra 10 amino acid residue ""tail"" at the C-terminus. The structural and functional role of the extra C-terminal residues in the catalysis of HTLV-1 protease has been a subject of debate for years. Using the native chemical ligation technique pioneered by Kent and coworkers, we chemically synthesized a full-length HTLV protease and a C-terminally truncated form encompassing residues 1-116. Enzyme kinetic analysis using three different peptide substrates indicated that truncation of the C-terminal tail lowered the turnover number of the viral enzyme by a factor of 2 and its catalytic efficiency by roughly 10-fold. Our findings differ from the two extreme views that the C-terminal tail of HTLV-1 protease is either fully dispensable or totally required for enzyme dimerization and/or catalysis.","['Li, Changqing', 'Li, Xiangqun', 'Lu, Wuyuan']","['Li C', 'Li X', 'Lu W']","['Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 725 West Lombard Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HTLV-1 protease)']",IM,"['Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2010/07/02 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bip.21375 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2010;94(4):487-94. doi: 10.1002/bip.21375.,,,"['R01 AI061482/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI061482-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072732/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072732-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2917242,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS214727'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional selectivity profiling for kinase inhibitors has relied upon screening panels of recombinant enzymes in biochemical assay formats. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of using cellular assays to better approximate true biological selectivity. We have developed a portfolio of CellSensor beta-lactamase transcriptional reporter gene assays that can be used to screen for perturbagens of various endogenous signaling pathways. Here we describe a multi-pathway profiling approach for generating compound-pathway selectivity maps. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we have screened 32 known compounds across a diverse panel of 12 key signaling pathways and generated the first comprehensive cellular pathway selectivity profiles of several clinically approved kinase and other well-known bioactive inhibitors. Selectivity score comparisons identified several kinase inhibitors that were more promiscuous than predicted by traditional biochemical profiling methods. For example, we identified effects of sorafenib on the JAK/STAT pathway and demonstrated the potential therapeutic indication of sorafenib in treating leukemia/myeloproliferative disorder patients harboring TEL-JAK2 or JAK2V617F mutations. Our results indicate that multi-pathway profiling can efficiently characterize both on and off-pathway compound activities, revealing potential novel pathways and opportunities for drug repositioning purposes and/or safety liabilities in one profiling campaign.","['Hancock, Michael K', 'Lebakken, Connie S', 'Wang, Jun', 'Bi, Kun']","['Hancock MK', 'Lebakken CS', 'Wang J', 'Bi K']","['Discovery Assays and Services, Invitrogen, Part of Life Technologies, Madison, WI 53719, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100630,England,Mol Biosyst,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'beta-Lactamases/metabolism']",2010/07/02 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c003669b [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biosyst. 2010 Oct;6(10):1834-43. doi: 10.1039/c003669b.

In concert with decreases in Bcr-Abl levels, KU812 and K562 cells responded to GO-201 with induction of a differentiated myeloid phenotype as evidenced by increased expression of CD11b, CD11c and CD14. The results also show that the GO-201-treated cells undergo a late apoptotic/necrotic response, consistent with induction of terminal differentiation.

During the last 10 years, many investigative groups have applied the formidable power of new molecular biology techniques to hunt for recurrent genetic alterations in MDS primary cells. Several genetic abnormalities, including mutations in RUNX1 (AML1), TET2, ASXL1 and TP53, have been discovered in a substantial fraction of MDS cases; genes rearranged or mutated less commonly in MDS include IER3, ATRX, RAS and FLT3. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency and expression changes in RPS14, miR-145 and miR-146a, CDC25c, PP2A and SPARC in the absence of point mutations have also been implicated in MDS pathobiology. A major challenge will be to determine which of these mutations are causative ""drivers"" either in the development or progression of MDS, which might be therapeutically important because they predict response to treatment, and which are merely ""passengers"" along for the ride that alter phenotype but have no effect on the natural history of the disease. While the altered cellular biology of MDS is also increasingly well-understood, many mysteries remain. Abnormalities in iron regulation, microenvironment interactions, regulation of apoptosis and oxidative damage/DNA repair may all play an important pathobiological role. By gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of these complex and heterogeneous diseases, we will hopefully improve our ability to treat our patients with MDS beyond the therapies with limited effectiveness that are available at present.","['Davids, Matthew S', 'Steensma, David P']","['Davids MS', 'Steensma DP']","['Department of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100805,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,['Bone Marrow failure syndromes'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Repair/genetics', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2010/07/02 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['12612 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.10.4.12612 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Aug 15;10(4):309-19. doi: 10.4161/cbt.10.4.12612.

Patients with early phase (also known as chronic phase [CP]) disease usually respond to treatment with ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), although some patients who respond initially later become resistant. In most patients, TKIs reduce the leukemia cell load substantially, but the cells from which the leukemia cells are derived during CP (so-called leukemia stem cells [LSCs]) are intrinsically insensitive to TKIs and survive long term. LSCs or their progeny can acquire additional genetic and/or epigenetic changes that cause the leukemia to transform from CP to a more advanced phase, which has been subclassified as either accelerated phase or blastic phase disease. The latter responds poorly to treatment and is usually fatal. Here, we discuss what is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to blastic transformation of CML and propose some novel therapeutic approaches.","['Perrotti, Danilo', 'Jamieson, Catriona', 'Goldman, John', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Perrotti D', 'Jamieson C', 'Goldman J', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 41230, USA. danilo.perrotti@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20100701,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2010/07/02 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['41246 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI41246 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2010 Jul;120(7):2254-64. doi: 10.1172/JCI41246.

Patients treated with IL-2Rgamma(c) gene therapy have T cells develop; however, their NK cell numbers remain low, suggesting antiviral responses may be compromised. Similarly, IL-2Rgamma(c)(-/-) mice reconstituted with IL-2Rgamma(c) developed few NK cells, and reconstituted T cells exhibited defective proliferative responses suggesting incomplete recovery of IL-2Rgamma(c) signaling. Given the shift toward self-inactivating long terminal repeats with weaker promoters to control the risk of leukemia, we assessed NK and T cell numbers and function in IL-2Rgamma(c)(-/-) mice reconstituted with limiting amounts of IL-2Rgamma(c). Reconstitution resulted in lower IL-2/-15-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation in NK and T cells. However, TCR costimulation restored cytokine-driven T cell proliferation to wild-type levels. Vector modifications that improved IL-2Rgamma(c) levels increased cytokine-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in both populations and increased NK cell proliferation demonstrating that IL-2Rgamma(c) levels are limiting. In addition, although the half-lives of both NK and T cells expressing intermediate levels of IL-2Rgamma(c) are reduced compared with wild-type cells, the reduction in NK cell half-live is much more severe than in T cells. Collectively, these data indicate different IL-2Rgamma(c) signaling thresholds for lymphocyte development and proliferation making functional monitoring imperative during gene therapy. Further, our findings suggest that IL-2Rgamma(c) reconstituted T cells may persist more efficiently than NK cells due to compensation for suboptimal IL-2Rgamma(c) signaling by the TCR.","['Orr, Selinda J', 'Roessler, Stephen', 'Quigley, Laura', 'Chan, Tim', 'Ford, Jill W', ""O'Connor, Geraldine M"", 'McVicar, Daniel W']","['Orr SJ', 'Roessler S', 'Quigley L', 'Chan T', 'Ford JW', ""O'Connor GM"", 'McVicar DW']","['Cancer and Inflammation Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100630,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/*biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics', 'Interleukin-15/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2010/07/02 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903528 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903528 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Aug 1;185(3):1393-403. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903528.

To prevent relapses, personalized treatment strategies are currently being developed, which target specific molecular aberrations. To determine relevance of established AML type I/II mutations that may serve as therapeutic targets, we assessed frequencies of these mutations and their persistence during disease progression in a large group (n = 69) of paired diagnosis and relapse pediatric AML specimens. In 26 of 42 patients (61%) harboring mutations at either stage of the disease, mutation status changed between diagnosis and relapse, particularly in FLT3, WT1, and RAS genes. Presence or gain of type I/II mutations at relapse was associated with a shorter time to relapse (TTR), whereas absence or loss correlated with longer TTR. Moreover, an adverse outcome was found for patients with activating mutations at relapse, which was statistically significant for FLT3/ITD and WT1 mutations. These findings suggest that mutational shifts affect disease progression. We hence propose that risk stratification, malignant cell detection, and selection of personalized treatment should be based on status of type I/II mutations both at initial diagnosis and during follow-up.","['Bachas, Costa', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan', 'Hollink, Iris H I M', 'Kwidama, Zinia J', 'Goemans, Bianca F', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Bachas C', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Hollink IH', 'Kwidama ZJ', 'Goemans BF', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'de Bont ES', 'Reinhardt D', 'Creutzig U', 'de Haas V', 'Assaraf YG', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology,VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100630,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation', '*Precision Medicine', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2010/07/02 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31261-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-276519 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 14;116(15):2752-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-276519.

Of 376 patients with a known MLL status in the trial, 297 (79%) were MLL(+). Among the 277 of 297 MLL(+) patients (93%) in first remission (CR), there appeared to be a significant difference in disease-free survival (adjusted by waiting time to HSCT) between the 37 (13%) who received HSCT and the 240 (87%) who received chemotherapy only (P = .03). However, the advantage was restricted to a subgroup with 2 additional unfavorable prognostic features: age less than 6 months and either poor response to steroids at day 8 or leukocytes more than or equal to 300 g/L. Ninety-seven of 297 MLL(+) patients (33%) had such high-risk criteria, with 87 achieving CR. In this group, HSCT was associated with a 64% reduction in the risk of failure resulting from relapse or death in CR (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.86). In the remaining patients, there was no advantage for HSCT over chemotherapy only. In summary, HSCT seems to be a valuable option for a subgroup of infant MLL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying further poor prognostic factors.

Unlike normal adult stem cells that remain constant in number, CSCs can increase in number as tumours grow, and give rise to progeny that can be both locally invasive and colonise distant sites - the two hallmarks of malignancy. Immunodeficient mouse models in which human tumours can be xenografted provide persuasive evidence that CSCs are present in human leukaemias and many types of solid tumour. In addition, many studies have found similar subpopulations in mouse tumours that show enhanced tumorigenic properties when they are transplanted into histocompatible mice. In this Commentary, we refer to CSCs as tumour-propagating cells (TPCs), a term that reflects the assays that are currently employed to identify them. We first discuss evidence that cancer can originate from normal stem cells or closely related descendants. We then outline the attributes of TPCs and review studies in which they have been identified in various cancers.

Four female patients from a single family, with typical clinical characteristics of IP, are reported. In addition, all affected family members show a distinct haematological phenotype: hypogranular granulocytes, leucocytes with pseudoplatelets, and different anomalies of nuclei. Pseudoplatelets are a typical finding in patients with leukaemia. As there is dysfunction of the IKBKG gene in leukaemia, it is hypothesised that mis-regulation of the NEMO pathway may cause the appearance of pseudoplatelets in acute leukaemias as well as in IP. These observations suggest that IP may not be only linked to skin and organs of the ectodermal origin.","['Minic, S', 'Trpinac, D', 'Obradovic, M', 'Novotny, G E K', 'Gabriel, H D', 'Kuhn, M']","['Minic S', 'Trpinac D', 'Obradovic M', 'Novotny GE', 'Gabriel HD', 'Kuhn M']","['Institute of Dermatology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia. dtrpinac@eunet.rs']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (IKBKG protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics', 'Incontinentia Pigmenti/*blood/genetics', 'Leukocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree']",2010/07/02 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']","['63/7/657 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2009.074203 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2010 Jul;63(7):657-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2009.074203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With 40,000-76,000 new cases per year in the USA, MDS is the commonest of the hematological malignancies and represents a significant burden of morbidity and premature death. Although supportive or palliative measures such as blood transfusion have long been the mainstay of management of MDS, disease-modifying medical therapies have recently become available. The most extensively characterized of these is 5-azacytidine (5-Aza); however, no consensus exists on how this agent should be deployed in MDS. METHODS: An overarching search of the literature identified 7019 citations investigating the treatment or management of MDS. Of those, six clinical articles of prospective phase 2-3 study design or meta-analyses were selected for inclusion in a systematic review of the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The Canadian Consortium on Evidence-Based Care in MDS recommends 5-Aza as first line therapy in all MDS patients with IPSS high-intermediate and high risk scores including WHO-defined AML (20-30% blasts) who cannot proceed immediately to allogeneic stem cell transplant. 5-Aza is not recommended as first line therapy with MDS patients with IPSS Low and Low-intermediate risk scores as there is no evidence that it alters the natural history of the disease nor is superior to standard therapy. The MDS consortium does not recommend combining 5-Aza with other agents at this time outside the context of a clinical trial.","['Buckstein, Rena', 'Yee, Karen', 'Wells, Richard A']","['Buckstein R', 'Yee K', 'Wells RA']","['Myelodysplastic Syndromes Program, The Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20100629,Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Quality of Life']",2010/07/02 06:00,2011/03/03 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(10)00105-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2011 Apr;37(2):160-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.05.006.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 45,082 patients who underwent cataract surgery in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) between October 1, 2005 and September 30, 2007. METHODS: The National Patient (US) Care Database (NPCD) was used to identify all patients who underwent outpatient extracapsular cataract surgery performed in the VHA and who had only 1 cataract surgery within 90 days of the index surgery. Data collected includes demographics, number of hospitalizations within 1 year before surgery, postoperative mortality, and systemic comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), which predicts the 1-year mortality for a patient based on a range of co-morbid conditions scored 1, 2, 3 or 6 depending on the risk of dying associated with the condition. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) of factors predictive of 90-day mortality were calculated using logistical regression modeling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality within 90 days of cataract surgery. RESULTS: Of the 53,786 patients who underwent cataract surgery during the study period, 45,082 met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 71.8 years; 97.6% were men; 5.0% had complex cataract surgery. The most frequent systemic comorbidities in the CCI were diabetes mellitus (40.6%), chronic pulmonary disease (21.2%), malignant neoplasms (12.5%) and congestive heart failure (CHF; 9.5%). Patients had a median CCI score of 1; 43.7% had a score >/= 2. Mortality rate within 90 days after cataract surgery was 7.1 per 1000 patients. Independent predictors of 90-day postoperative mortality were [adjusted OR, (95% confidence interval; CI)]: age 80 or greater [2.54 (1.62, 3.98)], CCI >/= 2 [2.06 (1.58, 2.70)], >/= 1 hospitalizations in the past year [1.85 (1.45, 2.36)], chronic pulmonary disease (CPD) [1.69 (1.34, 2.14)], CHF [1.71 (1.29, 2.14)], cirrhosis [2.60 (1.31, 5.15)], multiple myeloma or leukemia [2.20 (1.07, 4.53)], and metastatic solid tumor [4.17 (1.80, 9.66)]. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of 90-day mortality after cataract surgery is low, even for patients at higher risk for mortality such as the elderly and those with a high preoperative disease burden.","['Greenberg, Paul B', 'Liu, Jeffrey', 'Wu, Wen-Chih', 'Jiang, Lan', 'Tseng, Victoria L', 'Scott, Ingrid U', 'Friedmann, Peter D']","['Greenberg PB', 'Liu J', 'Wu WC', 'Jiang L', 'Tseng VL', 'Scott IU', 'Friedmann PD']","['Section of Ophthalmology, VA Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island 02908, USA. paul_greenberg@brown.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100701,United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cataract Extraction/*mortality', 'Comorbidity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Veterans/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Postoperative Complications/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs/statistics & numerical data']",2010/07/02 06:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2009/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-6420(10)00173-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.02.009 [doi]']",ppublish,"Ophthalmology. 2010 Oct;117(10):1894-9, 1899.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.02.009.

We have investigated the role of proteolytic processing of the Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope-protein through site-directed mutagenesis of the residues near the SU-TM cleavage site and have established that uncleaved glycoprotein is unable either to be incorporated into virus particles efficiently or to induce membrane fusion. Additionally, the results suggest that cleavage of the envelope protein plays an important role in intracellular trafficking of protein via the cellular secretory pathway. Based on our results it was concluded that a positively charged residue located at either P2 or P4 along with the arginine at P1 is essential for cleavage.","['Apte, Swapna', 'Sanders, David Avram']","['Apte S', 'Sanders DA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1392, USA. apte@purdue.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100629,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Transport', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Attachment', '*Virus Internalization']",2010/07/02 06:00,2010/08/27 06:00,['2010/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(10)00385-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2010.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2010 Sep 15;405(1):214-24. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2010.06.004.

This study aims to establish the binding affinity of purified Bt 18 toxin for CEM-SS (T lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line), to determine if competition exists between the toxin and commercial anticancer drugs for the binding site on CEM-SS and to localise the binding site of the toxin on CEM-SS. METHODS: In homologous competitive binding study, the purified toxin was labelled with biotin and allowed to compete with unlabelled toxin for binding sites on CEM-SS and its dissociation constant (Kd) was determined. Comparisons were made with CCRF-SB, CCRF-HSB-2 and MCF-7. In heterologous competitive binding study, biotinylated toxin competition was determined with two other Bt toxins (crude Btj and crude Bt 22) and anticancer drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, navelbine and methotrexate). To localise the binding site under the confocal microscope, the biotinylated toxin was tagged with FITC-conjugated streptavidin. RESULTS: Homologous competitive binding assays revealed decreasing binding affinity of Bt 18 toxin for CEM-SS, CCRF-SB, and CCRF-HSB-2 with Kd of 8.44 nM, 14.98 nM and 17.71 nM respectively. Kd for MCF-7 was not determined as the inhibitory concentration (IC50) was not reached. Heterologous competitive study showed little competition (< 30%) between biotinylated Bt 18 toxin and all test compounds used.

We identified the FD-891 biosynthetic (gfs) gene cluster from the producer Streptomyces graminofaciens A-8890 by using typical modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes as probes. The gfs gene cluster contained five typical modular type I PKS genes (gfsA, B, C, D, and E), a cytochrome P450 gene (gfsF), a methyltransferase gene (gfsG), and a regulator gene (gfsR). The gene organization of PKSs agreed well with the basic polyketide skeleton of FD-891 including the oxidation states and alpha-alkyl substituent determined by the substrate specificities of the acyltransferase (AT) domains. To clarify the involvement of the gfs genes in the FD-891 biosynthesis, the P450 gfsF gene was inactivated; this resulted in the loss of FD-891 production. Instead, the gfsF gene-disrupted mutant accumulated a novel FD-891 analogue 25-O-methyl-FD-892, which lacked the epoxide and the hydroxyl group of FD-891. Furthermore, the recombinant GfsF enzyme coexpressed with putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase converted 25-O-methyl-FD-892 into FD-891. In the course of the GfsF reaction, 10-deoxy-FD-891 was isolated as an enzymatic reaction intermediate, which was also converted into FD-891 by GfsF. Therefore, it was clearly found that the cytochrome P450 GfsF catalyzes epoxidation and hydroxylation in a stepwise manner in the FD-891 biosynthesis. These results clearly confirmed that the identified gfs genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of FD-891 in S. graminofaciens.","['Kudo, Fumitaka', 'Motegi, Atsushi', 'Mizoue, Kazutoshi', 'Eguchi, Tadashi']","['Kudo F', 'Motegi A', 'Mizoue K', 'Eguchi T']","['Department of Chemistry, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 O-okayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8551, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Macrolides)', '142383-53-7 (FD 891)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*biosynthesis', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Epoxy Compounds', 'Hydroxylation', '*Macrolides', '*Multigene Family', 'Streptomyces/genetics']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.201000214 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2010 Jul 26;11(11):1574-82. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201000214.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Chembiochem. 2010 Sep 3;11(13):1798'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on the cardiac effects of lower cumulative doses of these drugs are not conclusive. The aim of this study was to assess the cardiac effects of low cumulative anthracycline doses in long-term survivors of ALL. PROCEDURE: Echocardiograms were performed on 62 long-term ALL survivors, without any overt or sub-clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure. The interval after stopping therapy was 12.6 +/- 4.3 years; the mean cumulative dose of anthracyclines was 228.2 +/- 42.3 mg/m(2) . Left ventricular (LV) structure and function were studied by echocolor-Doppler. An age, gender and body surface area (BSA) matched group of healthy subjects was used as controls. Cardiac data were analyzed before and after BSA normalization. RESULTS: Long term survivors of ALL, showed a lower LV mass index, interventricular septal and posterior wall thickness, which were independently related to gender and to age at which the ALL diagnosis was made. Data analyzed according to gender showed that abnormalities were confined to the female group. No alterations were observed in the ALL male group versus the corresponding control group. No relationship was observed between the echocardiografic abnormalities and the duration of follow-up or the anthracycline mean dose employed. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of any signs or symptoms of heart failure, female ALL survivors treated with low cumulative anthracycline doses, showed a reduced LV mass and wall thickness. This suggests that in female ALL survivors an echocardyographic follow-up should be recommended.","['Amigoni, Maria', 'Giannattasio, Cristina', 'Fraschini, Donatella', 'Galbiati, Marianna', 'Capra, Anna Clara Maria', 'Madotto, Fabiana', 'Cesana, Francesca', 'Jankovic, Momcilo', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Mancia, Giuseppe']","['Amigoni M', 'Giannattasio C', 'Fraschini D', 'Galbiati M', 'Capra AC', 'Madotto F', 'Cesana F', 'Jankovic M', 'Masera G', 'Mancia G']","['Clinica Medica, Milano-Bicocca University and S.Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22637 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Dec 15;55(7):1343-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22637.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the prevalence of CRFs in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilms tumor. PROCEDURE: Adult survivors of ALL and Wilms tumor treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RT + CT) or treated with chemotherapy alone (CT) were compared with sibling controls. CRFs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, renal insufficiency) and hormonal deficiencies were assessed in each participant. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between CRFs and treatment. RESULTS: Seventy-nine ALL, 62 Wilms tumor survivors, and 69 control subjects (mean ages 24.5, 25.9, and 26 years, respectively) were enrolled. Mean follow-up time since cancer treatment was 20.8 years. In the Wilms RT + CT group significantly more survivors had hypertension (21.6% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.001) and renal insufficiency (8.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.016) compared to controls. There were also more patients with multiple CRFs in the Wilms RT + CT group (16.2% vs. 2.9% in controls, P = 0.019). Almost 15% of ALL RT + CT survivors had growth hormone deficiency. Hypogonadism was seen in 18.9% of survivors in the Wilms RT + CT group. We observed no significant differences between CT-treated survivors of both malignancies and controls. The adjusted odds ratio for the occurrence of at least one CRF was 2.6 increased for survivors following abdominal radiotherapy. Treatment with CT alone was not associated with the occurrence of multiple CRFs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of ALL and Wilms tumor have unfavorable CRFs due to previous RT not CT.","['Geenen, M M', 'Bakker, P J M', 'Kremer, L C M', 'Kastelein, J J P', 'van Leeuwen, F E']","['Geenen MM', 'Bakker PJ', 'Kremer LC', 'Kastelein JJ', 'van Leeuwen FE']","[""Outpatient Clinic of Late Effects Following Childhood Cancer, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center (EKZ/AMC), Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.geenen@slaz.nl""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Lipids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Lipids/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Wilms Tumor/*complications/mortality/therapy']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22518 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Oct;55(4):690-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22518.,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This patient exhibited no therapy-related toxicity after chemotherapy, suggesting that acute leukemia with BWS may not require a reduction in dosage.","['Yamamoto, Shohei', 'Toyama, Daisuke', 'Yatsuki, Hitomi', 'Higashimoto, Ken', 'Soejima, Hidenobu', 'Isoyama, Keiichi']","['Yamamoto S', 'Toyama D', 'Yatsuki H', 'Higashimoto K', 'Soejima H', 'Isoyama K']","['Division of Pediatrics, Department of Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. shohei-y@showa-university-fujigaoka.gr.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*etiology', 'Male']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22650 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Oct;55(4):733-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22650.,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined a large number of possible socio-economic late effects following treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in order to identify factors leading to a poor outcome. PROCEDURE: All individuals who had been diagnosed with ALL and who were alive in January 2007 (n = 213; men = 107) were identified from a database of all patients with cancer before the age of 18 in Southern Sweden from 1970 to 1999. For each subject, 50 matched controls were identified from the Swedish Population Register. Information on marital status, children, education, employment, income, and support from the community was obtained from Statistics Sweden. RESULTS: At the ages of 25 and 30, survivors of ALL had attained a lower level of education than controls. At the age of 30, they were less often employed (70% vs. 82%, P = 0.019), less often married (19% vs. 32%, P = 0.019), and had children to a lesser extent (31% vs. 47%, P = 0.011) than controls. We identified young age at diagnosis as a risk factor for adverse outcome in the majority of the socio-economic variables studied, apart from the known risk of cranial irradiation treatment. Furthermore, female survivors had a greater risk of achieving a lower level of education than both male survivors and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Young age at diagnosis, as well as treatment with cranial irradiation, is a risk factor for socio-economic late effects after treatment for ALL in childhood.","['Holmqvist, Anna Sallfors', 'Wiebe, Thomas', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Lindgren, Anna', 'Ora, Ingrid', 'Moell, Christian']","['Holmqvist AS', 'Wiebe T', 'Hjorth L', 'Lindgren A', 'Ora I', 'Moell C']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. anna.sallfors-holmqvist@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Educational Status', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22670 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Oct;55(4):698-707. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22670.,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its occurrence might be harmless, however, Candida infections often present with an underlying systemic disease. Thus, candidiasis in some cases can be considered as an indicator for e.g. diabetes mellitus or immune deficiency (i.e. HIV or leukaemia). Of note, we have to distinguish the colonisation and the infection with Candida because only the presence of the yeast together with clinical symptoms is an indication for treatment. The latter has to be adapted according to age, localisation and potentially underlying systemic disease. A special form of Candidiasis constitutes the chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis which can occur in line with hereditary immune deficiencies or also isolated.

METHODS: Data of 579 boys treated at our center over 16 years was reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen (2.4%) males had OTD. 10 (71.4%) of these had high-risk disease. Patients with OTD, had a significantly higher incidence of mediastinal-adenopathy (p=0.001), hyperleucocytosis (p=0.004) and CNS disease at presentation (p<0.0001) compared to patients in continuous complete remission (CCR). 4 of the 11 patients with OTD, who opted for therapy, had relapse; 2 are in CCR. Although, survival in patients with OTD was inferior (p=0.183) compared to patients without OTD, it was not an independent prognostic factor (p=0.47). In the entire study cohort, symptom-diagnosis interval (p=0.006), white cell (p=0.001) and platelet count (p=0.001) at presentation were significantly associated with survival (Cox multivariate regression analysis). CONCLUSIONS: OTD was not an independent prognostic factor, despite association with high-risk features. Survival outcome was inferior. The observations indicate the need of revaluation of the present protocol with incorporation of intermediate dose and subsequently high-dose methotrexate (after assessment for toxicity and tolerance), risk-stratified therapy and plausibly omission of testicular irradiation.","['Marwaha, R K', 'Kulkarni, K P', 'Bansal, D', 'Trehan, A']","['Marwaha RK', 'Kulkarni KP', 'Bansal D', 'Trehan A']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Advanced Pediatric Center, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. rammarwaha1@rediffmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100629,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*pathology/*radiotherapy']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/11/09 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-010-0119-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2010 Jul;77(7):779-83. doi: 10.1007/s12098-010-0119-9.

These physiological features are known to be regulated by prostaglandins, nitric oxides, growth factors, and cytokines. Mucosal injury and inflammation occur when cytotoxic attacks overwhelm cellular capacity for defense or repair. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) promotes tumor cell proliferation in colon cancer cells after binding to its receptors, which are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Stimulation of GPCR can induce shedding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligands via activation of A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM), with subsequent transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR). In parallel with EGF signaling through EGFR activation, heparin-binding (HB)-EGF carboxy-terminal fragment (CTF) signaling is also involved in cell proliferation through nuclear export of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger. IL-8 induces cell proliferation and migration by an ADAM-dependent intranuclear translocation pathway of HB-EGF-CTF. Here, we focus on the mechanisms of IL-8-induced HB-EGF-CTF signaling, which is involved in cytoprotection and cellular repair.","['Tanida, Satoshi', 'Kataoka, Hiromi', 'Mizoshita, Tsutomu', 'Shimura, Takaya', 'Kamiya, Takeshi', 'Joh, Takashi']","['Tanida S', 'Kataoka H', 'Mizoshita T', 'Shimura T', 'Kamiya T', 'Joh T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Aichi 467-8601, Japan. stanida @ med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100625,Switzerland,Digestion,Digestion,0150472,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/growth & development/immunology/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/agonists/metabolism', '*Regeneration', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['000310903 [pii]', '10.1159/000310903 [doi]']",ppublish,Digestion. 2010;82(3):145-9. doi: 10.1159/000310903.

To address possible mechanisms of resistance, we investigated immunotoxin activity in a model system using the colon cancer cell line, DLD1. Despite causing complete inhibition of protein synthesis, there was no evidence that an immunotoxin targeted to the transferrin receptor caused apoptosis in these cells. To address a possible protective role of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, the BH3-only mimetic, ABT-737, was tested alone or in combination with immunotoxins. Neither the immunotoxin nor ABT-737 alone activated caspase 3, whereas the combination exhibited substantial activation. In other epithelial cell lines, ABT-737 enhanced the cytotoxicity of PE-related immunotoxins by as much as 20-fold, but did not enhance diphtheria toxin or cycloheximide. Because PE translocates to the cytosol via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the other toxins do not, ABT-737-mediated effects on the ER were investigated. ABT-737 treatment stimulated increased levels of ER stress response factor, ATF4. Because of its activity in the ER, ABT-737 might be particularly well suited for enhancing the activity of immunotoxins that translocate from the ER to the cell cytosol.","['Traini, Roberta', 'Ben-Josef, Gal', 'Pastrana, Diana V', 'Moskatel, Elizabeth', 'Sharma, Ashima K', 'Antignani, Antonella', 'Fitzgerald, David J']","['Traini R', 'Ben-Josef G', 'Pastrana DV', 'Moskatel E', 'Sharma AK', 'Antignani A', 'Fitzgerald DJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100629,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Exotoxins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pseudomonas/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/11/05 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0257 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0257 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 Jul;9(7):2007-15. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0257.

We compared the outcomes of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloiod leukemia following myeloproliferative neoplasm. We also intended to find prognostic factors in secondary acute myeloid leukemia overall. METHODS: Retrospective medical record review at Seoul National University Hospital was performed. We assessed response to induction chemotherapy and overall survival. RESULTS: Ninety-five secondary acute myeloid leukemia patients (median age of 56.4 years) were analyzed. Twenty-six, 57 and 12 patients had therapy-related leukemia, leukemia following myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasm, respectively. For patients receiving induction chemotherapy, complete remission rate was 47.5% and complete remission rate was different according to the type of the preceding disorders (P = 0.004). Compared to therapy-related leukemia (P = 0.027) and leukemia following myelodysplastic syndrome (P = 0.050), leukemia following myeloproliferative neoplasm had shorter overall survival. In secondary leukemia, presence of trisomy 8 had a prognostic impact (P = 0.003) along with cytogenetic risk group (P = 0.016). In multivariate analysis, the type of the preceding disorders (P = 0.026), 5q deletion (P = 0.015) and trisomy 8 (P = 0.040) were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis of secondary acute myeloid leukemia was different according to the type of the preceding disorders with the worst prognosis in leukemia following myeloprolfierative neoplasm.

The link between tumorigenesis and immunosuppression is well known and the increased prevalence of MCC in human immunodeficiency virus carriers and organ transplant recipients and in patients with hemato-oncological neoplasias is now well recognized over the past decade. In this respect, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) seems to be the most frequent neoplasia associated with the development of MCC. Very recently, a newly described virus, the Merkel cell polyomavirus, was found in approximately 80% of MCC tumor samples and is in fact the first member of the polyomavirus family to be associated with human tumors. The virus appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of MCC and may constitute the missing link between immunosuppression and the development of MCC. This review summarizes the current knowledge relating to MCC and its pathogenesis, stressing the link with hematologic neoplasias in general and to CLL in particular. We describe the permissive immunologic environment, which enables the virus-containing tumor cells to survive and proliferate in disorders like CLL.

However, rapid identification of these lesions has been hampered by experimental limitations. Our in silico analysis of known cancer-derived TK fusions revealed that most breakpoints occur within a defined region upstream of a conserved GXGXXG kinase motif. We therefore designed a novel DNA-based targeted sequencing approach to screen systematically for fusions within the 90 human TKs; it should detect 92% of known TK fusions. We deliberately paired 'in-solution' DNA capture with 454 sequencing to minimize starting material requirements, take advantage of long sequence reads, and facilitate mapping of fusions. To validate this platform, we analyzed genomic DNA from thyroid cancer cells (TPC-1) and leukemia cells (KG-1) with fusions known only at the mRNA level. We readily identified for the first time the genomic fusion sequences of CCDC6-RET in TPC-1 cells and FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 in KG-1 cells. These data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to identify TK fusions across multiple human cancers in a high-throughput, unbiased manner. This method is distinct from other similar efforts, because it focuses specifically on targets with therapeutic potential, uses only 1.5 microg of DNA, and circumvents the need for complex computational sequence analysis.","['Chmielecki, Juliann', 'Peifer, Martin', 'Jia, Peilin', 'Socci, Nicholas D', 'Hutchinson, Katherine', 'Viale, Agnes', 'Zhao, Zhongming', 'Thomas, Roman K', 'Pao, William']","['Chmielecki J', 'Peifer M', 'Jia P', 'Socci ND', 'Hutchinson K', 'Viale A', 'Zhao Z', 'Thomas RK', 'Pao W']","['Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20100629,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (CCDC6 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2010/07/01 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['gkq579 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkq579 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Nov;38(20):6985-96. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkq579.

Moran's I is a widely used spatial statistic for detecting global spatial patterns such as an east-west trend or an unusually large cluster. Here, we intend to improve Moran's I for evaluating global clustering patterns by including the weight function in the variance, introducing a population density (PD) weight function in the statistics, and conducting Monte Carlo simulation for testing. We compare our modified Moran's I with Oden's I*pop for simulated data with homogeneous populations. The proposed method is applied to a census tract data set. METHODS: We present a modified version of Moran's I which includes information about the strength of the neighboring association when estimating the variance for the statistic. We provide a power analysis on Moran's I, a modified version of Moran's I, and I*pop in a simulation study. Data were simulated under two common spatial correlation scenarios of local and global clustering. RESULTS: For simulated data with a large cluster pattern, the modified Moran's I has the highest power (43.4%) compared to Moran's I (39.9%) and I*pop (12.4%) when the adjacent weight function is used with 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 30% of the total population as the geographic range for the cluster.For two global clustering patterns, the modified Moran's I (power > 25.3%) performed better than both Moran's I (> 24.6%) and I*pop (> 7.9%) with the adjacent weight function. With the population density weight function, all methods performed equally well.In the real data example, all statistics indicate the existence of a global clustering pattern in a leukemia data set. The modified Moran's I has the lowest p-value (.0014) followed by Moran's I (.0156) and I*pop (.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our power analysis and simulation study show that the modified Moran's I achieved higher power than Moran's I and I*pop for evaluating global and local clustering patterns on geographic data with homogeneous populations. The inclusion of the PD weight function which in turn redefines the neighbors seems to have a large impact on the power of detecting global clustering patterns. Our methods to improve the original version of Moran's I for homogeneous populations can also be extended to some alternative versions of Moran's I methods developed for heterogeneous populations.","['Jackson, Monica C', 'Huang, Lan', 'Xie, Qian', 'Tiwari, Ram C']","['Jackson MC', 'Huang L', 'Xie Q', 'Tiwari RC']","['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, American University, Washington, DC 20016, USA. monica@american.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100629,England,Int J Health Geogr,International journal of health geographics,101152198,,IM,"['Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Models, Statistical', '*Monte Carlo Method', 'New York City/epidemiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Space-Time Clustering']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/10/15 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-072X-9-33 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-072X-9-33 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Health Geogr. 2010 Jun 29;9:33. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-9-33.,,,,PMC2903534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with myeloid leukemias can achieve long-term survival through targeted therapy, cure after intensive chemotherapy or short-term survival because of highly chemoresistant disease. Therefore, despite the development of advanced molecular diagnostics, there is an unmet need for efficient therapy that reflects the advanced diagnostics. Although the molecular design of therapeutic agents is aimed at interacting with specific proteins identified through molecular diagnostics, the majority of therapeutic agents act on multiple protein targets. Ongoing studies on the leukemic cell proteome will probably identify a large number of new biomarkers, and the prediction of response to therapy through these markers is an interesting avenue for future personalized medicine. Mass spectrometric protein detection is a fundamental technique in clinical proteomics, and selected tools are presented, including stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), as well as single cell determination. We suggest that protein analysis will play not only a supplementary, but also a prominent role in future molecular diagnostics, and we outline how accurate knowledge of the molecular therapeutic targets can be used to monitor therapy response.","['Hjelle, Sigrun M', 'Forthun, Rakel B', 'Haaland, Ingvild', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Sjoholt, Gry', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T']","['Hjelle SM', 'Forthun RB', 'Haaland I', 'Reikvam H', 'Sjoholt G', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Institute of Medicine, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.

This study compares imatinib with interferon in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) patients from the Chinese public health-care system perspective (CPHSP). METHODS: One-year cost responder and lifetime cost-utility analyses were conducted, respectively. Complete cytogenetic response was used to define a responder. Direct medical costs were included. Response rates as well as survival estimates were obtained from published literature. RESULTS: The cost per responder for interferon was close to 20 times higher than that for imatinib. The cost per additional responder was RMB36,545. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing imatinib with interferon was RMB73,674 (95% confidence interval RMB67,712-RMB79,637) per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSION: In newly diagnosed CML-CP, the cost per responder for patients treated with imatinib is much lower than that for patients treated with interferon. In the cost-utility analysis, the ICER is below the cost-effectiveness threshold recommended by the World Health Organization for developing countries. Therefore, imatinib is more cost-effective than interferon from the CPHSP.","['Chen, Zi', 'Wang, Chun', 'Xu, Xiaoping', 'Feng, Weiwei']","['Chen Z', 'Wang C', 'Xu X', 'Feng W']","['Shanghai Fudan University Affiliated Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'China', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon Type I/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics', 'National Health Programs', 'Piperazines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2010/07/10 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['VHE635 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00635.x [doi]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2009 Nov-Dec;12 Suppl 3:S85-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00635.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD44 is known to play a role in the engraftment of leukemia-initiating cells and is shed from the surface of malignant cells. Soluble CD44 is a cleaved fragment, which is found in the serum of patients with metastasized epithelial and hematologic malignancies and in some other cancers, and has been demonstrated to be correlated with clinical outcome. OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) a possible correlation between the concentration of CD44 in an autoHSCT graft and the type of hematologic malignancy and (2) a possible correlation between the concentration of CD44 in the autoHSCT graft with clinical outcome after autoHSCT. DESIGN: We measured CD44 in 157 hematopoietic stem cell grafts from patients with hematologic malignancies and from 43 healthy donors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Levels of CD44 were almost 2-fold higher in the patients' grafts. Highest levels were found in the grafts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and plasma cell myeloma, congruent with known CD44 expression levels in these malignancies. The survival advantage among patients with CD44 levels less than 22 000 ng/mL was highly statistically significant. CONCLUSION: These results show that CD44 levels in an autoHSCT graft may be linked to clinical outcome after autoHSCT.","['Krause, Daniela S', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Stowell, Christopher P']","['Krause DS', 'Spitzer TR', 'Stowell CP']","['Department of Pathology, Blood Transfusion Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St., Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Donors', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",2010/07/01 06:00,2010/07/21 06:00,['2010/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1043/2009-0347-OA.1 [pii]', '10.5858/2009-0347-OA.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2010 Jul;134(7):1033-8. doi: 10.5858/2009-0347-OA.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation carriers are at increased risk of multiple primary tumors, many of which arise in previous radiation-therapy sites. In patients with LFS, acute myeloid leukemia is uncommon and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is rare. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnostic findings of 3 unique cases of MDS arising in patients with germline TP53 mutation, 2 with classic LFS. DESIGN: We searched the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Registry in the Department of Genetics at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas) and identified 3 patients with documented germline TP53 mutations or LFS who had developed MDS during a period of 6 years (2000-2005). The clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnostic data and bone marrow aspirate smears and biopsies on all patients were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining with antibody to p53 was also performed. RESULTS: Two patients met the criteria for classic LFS; one had no history of malignancy in first-degree relatives. The MDS followed chemotherapy and radiation therapy and progressed to acute myeloid leukemia in 2 patients. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated chromosome 5 abnormalities in a complex karyotype in all cases. Two patients died, one of acute myeloid leukemia and one with glioblastoma multiforme, MDS, and persistent pancytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LFS may develop MDS, which is most likely therapy-related and is associated with cytogenetic markers of poor prognosis.","['Talwalkar, Sameer S', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Naeem, Rizwan C', 'Hicks, M John', 'Strong, Louise C', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['Talwalkar SS', 'Yin CC', 'Naeem RC', 'Hicks MJ', 'Strong LC', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Hematopathology,University of Texas M.

The scaffolds showed vascularization and presence of osteoclasts and adipocytes, suggestive of an organizing human bone marrow microenvironment in the murine host. The chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 are critical for homing and migration of acute myeloid leukemia.

Multiple small studies using zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) have shown response in patients with ATL. However, the impact of this innovative antiviral treatment strategy on long-term survival remains undetermined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a meta-analysis of antiviral therapy of ATL. Medical records of 254 patients with ATL who were treated in the United States, the United Kingdom, Martinique, and continental France were individually reviewed. RESULTS: According to Shimoyama classification, there were 116 patients with acute ATL, 18 patients with chronic ATL, 11 patients with smoldering ATL, and 100 patients with ATL lymphoma. In 231 patients with available survival data, first-line therapy was recorded in 207 patients. Five-year overall survival rates were 46% for 75 patients who received first-line antiviral therapy (P = .004), 20% for 77 patients who received first-line chemotherapy, and 12% for 55 patients who received first-line chemotherapy followed by antiviral therapy. Patients with acute, chronic, and smoldering ATL significantly benefited from first-line antiviral therapy, whereas patients with ATL lymphoma experienced a better outcome with chemotherapy. In acute ATL, achievement of complete remission with antiviral therapy resulted in 82% 5-year survival. Antiviral therapy in chronic and smoldering ATL resulted in 100% 5-year survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that first-line antiviral therapy significantly improves overall survival of patients with ATL (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.83; P = .021). CONCLUSION: These results confirm the high efficacy of AZT and IFN, which should now be considered the gold standard first-line therapy in leukemic subtypes of ATL.","['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Plumelle, Yves', 'Carlos Ramos, Juan', 'Tortevoye, Patricia', 'Otrock, Zaher', 'Taylor, Graham', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Harrington, William', 'Panelatti, Gerard', 'Hermine, Olivier']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Plumelle Y', 'Carlos Ramos J', 'Tortevoye P', 'Otrock Z', 'Taylor G', 'Gessain A', 'Harrington W', 'Panelatti G', 'Hermine O']","['American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Multicenter Study']",20100628,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Martinique', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Young Adult', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage']",2010/06/30 06:00,2010/10/19 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.28.0669 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.28.0669 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Sep 20;28(27):4177-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.0669.

L3MBTL1 is expressed within hematopoietic CD34(+) cells; thus, it may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. To define its role in hematopoiesis, we knocked down L3MBTL1 expression in primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor (ie, CD34(+)) cells isolated from human cord blood (using short hairpin RNAs) and observed an enhanced commitment to and acceleration of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with this effect, overexpression of L3MBTL1 in primary hematopoietic CD34(+) cells as well as in 20q- cell lines restricted erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, L3MBTL1 levels decrease during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation or erythropoietin exposure, suggesting a specific role for L3MBTL1 down-regulation in enforcing cell fate decisions toward the erythroid lineage. Indeed, L3MBTL1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to erythropoietin (Epo), with increased Epo-induced phosphorylation of STAT5, AKT, and MAPK as well as detectable phosphorylation in the absence of Epo. Our data suggest that haploinsufficiency of L3MBTL1 contributes to some (20q-) myeloproliferative neoplasms, especially polycythemia vera, by promoting erythroid differentiation.","['Perna, Fabiana', 'Gurvich, Nadia', 'Hoya-Arias, Ruben', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Asai, Takashi', 'Voza, Francesca', 'Menendez, Silvia', 'Wang, Lan', 'Liu, Fan', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Perna F', 'Gurvich N', 'Hoya-Arias R', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Levine RL', 'Asai T', 'Voza F', 'Menendez S', 'Wang L', 'Liu F', 'Zhao X', 'Nimer SD']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100628,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (L3MBTL1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*etiology/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2010/06/30 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31269-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-270611 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 14;116(15):2812-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-270611.

Although IRF-4 is expressed in myeloid cells, its function in that lineage is not known. The closely related family member IRF-8 is a critical regulator of myelopoiesis, which when deleted in mice results in a syndrome highly similar to human chronic myelogenous leukemia. In early lymphoid development, we have shown previously that IRF-4 and IRF-8 can function redundantly. We therefore investigated the effects of a combined loss of IRF-4 and IRF-8 on hematologic tumorigenesis. We found that mice deficient in both IRF-4 and IRF-8 develop from a very early age a more aggressive chronic myelogenous leukemia-like disease than mice deficient in IRF-8 alone, correlating with a greater expansion of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. Although these results demonstrate, for the first time, that IRF-4 can function as tumor suppressor in myeloid cells, interestingly, all mice deficient in both IRF-4 and IRF-8 eventually develop and die of a B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Combined losses of IRF-4 and IRF-8 therefore can cooperate in the development of both myeloid and lymphoid tumors.","['Jo, Seung-Hee', 'Schatz, Jonathan H', 'Acquaviva, Jaime', 'Singh, Harinder', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Jo SH', 'Schatz JH', 'Acquaviva J', 'Singh H', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center and Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100628,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics']",2010/06/30 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31262-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-234559 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 14;116(15):2759-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-234559.

The family members interact with and partly share a variety of ligands and partake in intracellular sorting and protein transport as well as in transmembrane signal transduction. Thus, sortilin mediates the transport of both neurotensin and nerve growth factor and interacts with their respective receptors to facilitate ligand-induced signaling. Here we report that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and related ligands targeting the established CNTF receptor alpha, binds to sortilin with high affinity. We find that sortilin may have at least two functions: one is to provide rapid endocytosis and the removal of CNTF, something which is not provided by CNTF receptor alpha, and the other is to facilitate CNTF signaling through the gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor beta heterodimeric complex. Interestingly, the latter function is independent of both the CNTF receptor alpha and ligand binding to sortilin but appears to implicate a direct interaction with LIF receptor beta. Thus, sortilin facilitates the signaling of all helical type 1 cytokines, which engage the gp130/LIF receptor beta complex.","['Larsen, Jakob Vejby', 'Hansen, Maria', 'Moller, Bjarne', 'Madsen, Peder', 'Scheller, Jurgen', 'Nielsen, Morten', 'Petersen, Claus Munck']","['Larsen JV', 'Hansen M', 'Moller B', 'Madsen P', 'Scheller J', 'Nielsen M', 'Petersen CM']","['MIND Center, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100628,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '0 (cytokine-like factor-1)', '0 (neuropoietin, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'Z020Y8WIJ4 (sortilin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/06/30 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00274-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00274-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Sep;30(17):4175-87. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00274-10.

RESULTS: The CNS-, CNS+ITC, and CNS+RT patients had 1- and 5-year relapse-free survivals (RFS) of 43% and 35%, 15% and 6%, and 37% and 32%, respectively. CNS+ITC patients had a statistically significant worse RFS compared with CNS- patients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-3.6; p < 0.0001). CNS+RT patients had improved relapse free survival over that of CNS+ITC patients (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; p = 0.01). The 1- and 5-year overall survivals (OS) of patients with CNS-, CNS+ITC, and CNS+RT, were 50% and 38%, 21% and 6%, and 53% and 42%, respectively. The survival of CNS+RT were significantly better than CNS+ITC patients (p = 0.004). After adjusting for known risk factors, CNS+RT patients had a trend toward lower relapse rates and reduced nonrelapse mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CNS+ AML is associated with a poor prognosis. The role of a cranial irradiation boost to intrathecal chemotherapy appears to mitigate the risk of CNS disease, and needs to be further investigated to define optimal treatment strategies.","['Mayadev, Jyoti S', 'Douglas, James G', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Mayadev JS', 'Douglas JG', 'Storer BE', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storb R']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195-6043, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100630,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/30 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2009/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(10)00265-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.01.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 May 1;80(1):193-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.01.062.

To bridge this gap in knowledge, we synthesized the existing epidemiologic evidence on the relation between occupational exposure to benzene and the risk of leukemia, including all types combined and the four main subgroups acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out using two databases 'Medline' and 'Embase' from 1950 through to July 2009. We selected articles which provided information that can be used to estimate the relation between benzene exposure and cancer risk (effect size). RESULTS: In total 15 studies were identified in the search, providing 16 effect estimates for the main analysis. The summary effect size for any leukemia from the fixed-effects model was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.23-1.57), but the study-specific estimates were strongly heterogeneous (I2 = 56.5%, Q stat = 34.47, p = 0.003). The random-effects model yielded a summary- effect size estimate of 1.72 (95% CI, 1.37-2.17). Effect estimates from 9 studies were based on cumulative exposures. In these studies the risk of leukemia increased with a dose-response pattern with a summary-effect estimate of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.13-2.39) for low (< 40 ppm-years), 1.90 (95% CI, 1.26-2.89) for medium (40-99.9 ppm-years), and 2.62 (95% CI, 1.57-4.39) for high exposure category (> 100 ppm-years). In a meta-regression, the trend was statistically significant (P = 0.015). Use of cumulative exposure eliminated heterogeneity. The risk of AML also increased from low (1.94, 95% CI, 0.95-3.95), medium (2.32, 95% CI, 0.91-5.94) to high exposure category (3.20, 95% CI, 1.09-9.45), but the trend was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides consistent evidence that exposure to benzene at work increases the risk of leukemia with a dose-response pattern. There was some evidence of an increased risk of AML and CLL. The meta-analysis indicated a lack of association between benzene exposure and the risk of CML.","['Khalade, Abdul', 'Jaakkola, Maritta S', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Jaakkola, Jouni J K']","['Khalade A', 'Jaakkola MS', 'Pukkala E', 'Jaakkola JJ']","['Institute of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20100628,England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Risk Factors']",2010/06/30 06:00,2010/08/31 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2009/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-069X-9-31 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-069X-9-31 [doi]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2010 Jun 28;9:31. doi: 10.1186/1476-069X-9-31.,,,,PMC2903550,,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly in human leukemia, chromosomal translocations involving crucial hematopoietic transcription factors are frequently causally linked to the disease. Transcription factors commonly have a modular structure, comprising distinct domains for DNA- binding, dimerization and protein-protein interaction. Each domain is functionally important and in principle accessible for a molecular-based therapeutic intervention. Uncovering the molecular structure of critical domains will allow the rational development of therapeutic agents that inhibit particular functions of leukemogenic transcription factors. However, so far most approaches are in the experimental stage. Among others, the RUNX1/ETO fusion protein, commonly found within acute myeloid leukemia cells carrying the translocation t(8;21), is currently intensively studied at the functional and structural level as well as in animal models. This combined effort has allowed the development of specific targeting approaches addressing different functional domains of the fusion protein. With a special focus on RUNX1/ETO we will discuss recent strategies to directly interfere with aberrant transcription factors to block their leukemogenic function.","['Wichmann, Christian', 'Grez, Manuel', 'Lausen, Jorn']","['Wichmann C', 'Grez M', 'Lausen J']","['Biomedical Research Institute Georg-Speyer-Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 42-44, 60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. c.wichmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2010/06/30 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00123 [pii]', '10.2174/138945010792006744 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2010 Sep;11(9):1181-91. doi: 10.2174/138945010792006744.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed fluorescent sensors for these kinases that are enzymatically and photophysically distinct, allowing us to simultaneously, yet separately, visualize the tyrosine kinase activities of both Abl and Lyn. Multicolor monitoring revealed that an imatinib-resistant cell line (MYL-R) displays a remarkable 13-fold enhancement in Lyn kinase activity relative to its imatinib-sensitive counterpart (MYL). By contrast, both cell lines display nearly identical Abl activities. The upregulation of Lyn kinase phosphotransferase activity in MYL-R cells is linked to an overexpression of the Lyn B isoform. Furthermore, MYL-R cells possess a 4-fold higher level of activated Lyn and 5-fold lower level of autoinhibited Lyn than MYL cells. Finally, studies with an activating SH2 ligand revealed that Lyn from imatinib-resistant MYL-R cells is primed and active, whereas Lyn from imatinib-sensitive cells is dependent upon phosphorylated SH2 ligands for activity.","['Wang, Qunzhao', 'Zimmerman, Eric I', 'Toutchkine, Alexei', 'Martin, Timothy D', 'Graves, Lee M', 'Lawrence, David S']","['Wang Q', 'Zimmerman EI', 'Toutchkine A', 'Martin TD', 'Graves LM', 'Lawrence DS']","['The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/30 06:00,2011/01/19 06:00,['2010/06/30 06:00'],"['2010/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb100099h [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2010 Sep 17;5(9):887-95. doi: 10.1021/cb100099h.,,,"['R01 CA079954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069976/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA79954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM069976/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA079954-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069976-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2943031,,,,['NIHMS219681'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study is a report of a rare case of primary gastric T-cell lymphoma without HTLV-1 which could be successfully treated with surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient was a 50-year-old Japanese male who presented with epigastric pain. Clinical examination showed no lymphadenopathy or skin changes. Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed an ill-demarcated ulcerative lesion in the stomach, and a biopsy specimen confirmed high-grade lymphoma. Total gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection was performed. Histological examination of the gastric lesion revealed a malignant lymphoma, diffuse large cell type, with lymph nodal involvement. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were positive for CD3, CD4 and CD30, but negative for CD8, CD20 and CD56, implying a T-cell nature. Following surgery, the patient received 8 cycles of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone/CHOP). To date the patient has been free of recurrence for 86 months without further treatment. Review of previously reported cases of primary gastric T-cell lymphoma indicates that the prognosis is better without than with HTLV-1.

Antibacterial prophylaxis therapy may thus be warranted. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rate of infections during induction therapy in two cohorts of children with ALL where one cohort received prophylactic sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP). PROCEDURE: All infections were registered through a retrospective non-randomized review of medical records of 171 consecutive children newly diagnosed with ALL below 15 years of age at diagnosis. A total of 85 children treated from 1992 to 2000 did not receive SMX-TMP, whereas 86 children treated from 2000 to 2008 received SMX-TMP 20 mg/kg in one daily oral dose during induction therapy. RESULTS: A total of 26% of all children had no febrile episodes during induction. Infections were more frequent in children below 5 years of age. Significantly fewer children receiving SMX-TMP developed fever (17% vs. 34%, P = 0.02) and bacteremia (20% vs. 45%, P = 0.0003). Especially children with non-high risk criteria had fewer infections when receiving prophylaxis. When adjusting for age, type of catheter, and SMX-TMP prophylaxis on the risk of bacteremia by a multiple Cox regression analysis, we found that age and prophylaxis, but not the type of catheter, were associated with a significantly reduced risk of bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Children with ALL receiving SMX-TMP prophylaxis during induction therapy experienced fewer febrile episodes, fewer days with fever demanding intravenous antibiotic treatment, and fewer episodes of bacteremia. Both SMX-TMP prophylaxis and age played significant independent roles for the occurrence of bacteremia.","['Rungoe, Christine', 'Malchau, Emma Louise', 'Larsen, Line Nordahl', 'Schroeder, Henrik']","['Rungoe C', 'Malchau EL', 'Larsen LN', 'Schroeder H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Aarhus N, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/chemically induced', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22423 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Aug;55(2):304-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22423.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor eradication is promoted by the anti-tumor activity of donor T cells contained in the transplant; however, donor T cells also mediate the serious side effect of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Separation of GVHD from graft anti-tumor activity is an important goal of research in improving transplant outcome. One approach is to take advantage of the immunomodulatory activity of regulatory NKT cells and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg of host and/or donor origin. Both host and donor NKT cells and donor Treg are able to prevent GVHD in murine models. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of NKT cell- and Treg-mediated protection against GVHD in mice while maintaining graft anti-tumor activity. In addition, we also examine the interactions between NKT cells and Treg in the context of BMT, and integrate the data from murine experimental models with the observations made in humans.","['Kohrt, Holbrook E', 'Pillai, Asha B', 'Lowsky, Robert', 'Strober, Samuel']","['Kohrt HE', 'Pillai AB', 'Lowsky R', 'Strober S']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomedical Research', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Communication', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201040394 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2010 Jul;40(7):1862-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.201040394.,,,"['R01 DK082537/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049605-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI037683-12/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI037683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049605-220001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI1037683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2926162,,,,['NIHMS224946'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presence of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with earlier tumorigenesis in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as decreased survival in patients with CLL. In addition, cells homozygous (G/G) for SNP 309 were found to have 10-fold increase resistance to topoisomerase II inhibitors in vitro. PROCEDURE: We genotyped children (n = 575) with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated on three Children's Oncology Group protocols (CCG 2941/2961/AAML 03P1) for the presence of SNP309. Healthy blood donors were genotyped as control population. RESULTS: The variant G/G genotype was associated with an increased susceptibility to AML (OR 1.5; P = 0.049). However, the presence of the variant allele at SNP309 did not modify disease response or toxicity in children treated on CCG protocols 2941/2961. CONCLUSIONS: The variant SNP 309 influences susceptibility to pediatric AML, but does not impact overall response to therapy.","['Phillips, Christine L', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Perentesis, John P', 'Harley, Isaac T W', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Bhatla, Deepika', 'Radloff, Gretchen', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Phillips CL', 'Gerbing R', 'Alonzo T', 'Perentesis JP', 'Harley IT', 'Meshinchi S', 'Bhatla D', 'Radloff G', 'Davies SM']","[""Division of Hematology Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA. christine.phillips@cchmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22519 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Aug;55(2):248-53. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22519.,,,"['T32 GM063483-08S2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA10262-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093552-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NR010262/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA93552-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NR010262-01/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM063483/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2915901,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS217002'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Rand-36-Item health Survey (RAND-36) was used to assess subjective HRQoL in 74 survivors of ALL an average of 20 years after the diagnosis. Cranial irradiation had been administered to 46 of the survivors, while 28 survivors had solely been treated with chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 146 healthy young adults selected from local population registry. Survivors were examined by a physician and late effects were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv3). RESULTS: ALL survivors achieved significantly higher scores than the controls on three of the eight HRQoL subscales; role limitations due to emotional problems (P = 0.030), mental health (P = 0.030) and vitality (P = 0.004). In comparison to controls, survivors with a follow-up of more than 20 years had significantly higher scores on vitality (P = 0.006) and mental health (P = 0.011).

No difference was found in CABSI between neither early versus later placed TIDs (IRR = 0.99 (95% CI 0.41-2.45) P = 0.98) nor early versus later placed TEs (IRR = 0.81 (95% CI 0.40-1.86) P = 0.54). We found no difference between early and later placed catheters regarding non-elective removal (RR = 0.86 (95% CI 0.72-1.03) P = 0.09). TEs had a higher risk of non-elective removal compared with TIDs (RR = 3.95 (95% CI 1.88-8.29) P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study did not find that children with ALL and with early placed CVCs experienced significantly more complications compared with children with late placed catheters. This study found that children with ALL and TEs experienced more complications than children with TIDs.","['Handrup, Mette Moller', 'Moller, Jens Kjolseth', 'Frydenberg, Morten', 'Schroder, Henrik']","['Handrup MM', 'Moller JK', 'Frydenberg M', 'Schroder H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Brendstrupgardsvej, Arhus, Denmark.

Overexpression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) has been shown to be associated with chemotherapy resistance in several malignancies. PROCEDURE: XIAP protein and mRNA expression were determined in leukemic blasts of 51 childhood ALL patients and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. XIAP expression was correlated with glucocorticoid response and outcome. RESULTS: XIAP protein but not mRNA expression was found to be highly increased in childhood ALL compared to control bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) (median: 3.5 vs. 0.14 ng/10(5) MNC, P < 0.0001) indicating a post-transcriptional regulation of XIAP expression. In patients with T-cell ALL, poor prednisone response was associated with increased XIAP expression (median: 2.8 in good vs. 5.8 in poor responders; P = 0.005). Similarly, T-cell ALL patients suffering adverse events showed higher initial XIAP levels than patients in continuous complete remission (CCR) (median: 2.7 in patients in CCR vs. 5.6 in patients suffering adverse events; P = 0.007). XIAP inhibition using the low-molecular-weight SMAC mimetic LBW242 resulted in a significant increase of prednisone-induced apoptosis in vitro. CONCLUSION: In childhood ALL compared to control bone marrow, the expression of the apoptosis inhibitor XIAP is highly increased by post-transcriptional regulation. The association with poor in vivo glucocorticoid response and outcome in T-cell ALL suggests XIAP inhibition as a promising novel approach for the treatment of resistant ALL.","['Hundsdoerfer, Patrick', 'Dietrich, Isabell', 'Schmelz, Karin', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Henze, Gunter']","['Hundsdoerfer P', 'Dietrich I', 'Schmelz K', 'Eckert C', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany. patrick.hundsdoerfer@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/analysis/*genetics']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22541 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Aug;55(2):260-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22541.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Pharyngeal swabs from patients with fevers of unknown origin, flu-like symptoms or bronchopneumonia were screened for H1N1 using PCR. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients with documented H1N1 infection were reported: 16 had recently stopped therapy, 2 were at the diagnosis stage, and 44 were receiving therapy. The clinical course was severe (requiring ICU admission) in only 1 patient, moderate (requiring hospital admission) in 38, and mild in the remaining 23 (37%), treated as outpatients. While none of the patients died of H1N1-related complications, two patients died of progressive cancer; in all of the remaining cases, symptoms resolved within 11 days. The clinical course was complicated by respiratory distress or bronchopneumonia in 10 cases. Oseltamivir was given to 82% of patients.

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with in vitro synergy with corticosteroids and clinical activity in human lymphoid malignancies. PROCEDURE: This is a Phase I study of escalating doses bortezomib administered days 1, 4, 8, and 11, added to 4-drug induction chemotherapy with vincristine, dexamethasone, pegylated L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin (VXLD) in children with relapsed ALL. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled, five in first marrow relapse, and five in second relapse. Four patients were enrolled at dose level 1 (bortezomib 1 mg/m(2)). One patient was not evaluable for toxicity because of omitted dexamethasone doses. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. Six patients were enrolled at dose level 2 (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2)). One patient had dose-limiting hypophosphatemia and rhabdomyolysis after 1 dose of bortezomib, and died from a diffuse zygomyces infection on day 17. Five additional patients were enrolled with no subsequent DLTs. As planned, no further dose escalation was pursued. The regimen had predictable toxicity related to the chemotherapy drugs. Two patients had mild peripheral neuropathy (grades 1 and 2). Six of nine evaluable patients (67%) achieved a complete response (CR), and one had a bone marrow CR with persistent central nervous system leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2)) with VXLD is active with acceptable toxicity in pretreated pediatric patients with relapsed ALL.

Distinct subtypes of DLBCL have been defined by gene expression profiling (GEP) and they differ not only in GE profiles but also in the pattern of genetic abnormalities. The ability to correlate corresponding genetic and GEP data markedly facilitates the identification of target genes in regions with copy number abnormalities. Oncogenic pathways are often differentially activated in these different subtypes of DLBCL, suggesting that therapy should be targeted according to these differences. The tumor microenvironment plays a significant role in determining outcome and may be a novel target for therapy. The role of microRNA in lymphomagenesis is increasingly being recognized and mutation of key genes has been demonstrated to drive the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and B cell receptor signaling. The pace of discovery will be even more rapid in the near future with the convergence of data from multiple complementary genome-wide studies and technological innovations including the rapid advance in the technology of high-throughput sequencing.","['Chan, Wing John C']",['Chan WJ'],"['Pathology and Microbiology and Center for Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA. jchan@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100629,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/drug therapy/*etiology/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/12/24 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0602-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Sep;92(2):219-30. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0602-0.

These populations have the ability not only to renew themselves, but also to give rise to diverse phenotypes through the process of differentiation. The result is the formation of clinically observed heterogeneous tumors. Because of their similarity to somatic stem cells, these small cell populations have been termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). The involvement of CSCs was demonstrated in leukemia and has since been noted in other solid tumors, such as brain, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers. We support the notion that a curative operation serves as the most beneficial means to make a prognosis of malignancies. However, currently, chemotherapy is another of the promising strategies for the successful treatment of some malignancies. It is thought, however, that CSCs play a role in resistance to anticancer therapy, thus leading to the occurrence of metastasis, a common characteristic of intractable tumors. As a result, the study of CSCs is expected to improve the effectiveness of current therapies and lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for such cancers in the future.","['Miyoshi, Norikatsu', 'Ishii, Hideshi', 'Sekimoto, Mitsugu', 'Haraguchi, Naotsugu', 'Doki, Yuichiro', 'Mori, Masaki']","['Miyoshi N', 'Ishii H', 'Sekimoto M', 'Haraguchi N', 'Doki Y', 'Mori M']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100626,Japan,Surg Today,Surgery today,9204360,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2008/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00595-009-4106-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Today. 2010 Jul;40(7):608-13. doi: 10.1007/s00595-009-4106-6.

Because of potential long-term effects of osteonecrosis on joints, information regarding its progression and collapse in different patients can be used to identify high-risk groups, advise the patients and parents of this complication, and potentially consider the risk for development of osteonecrosis in planning primary treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore determined: (1) the incidence of joint collapse and/or pain in young patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with ON of the knee; (2) risk factors associated with collapse; and (3) the relationship between size and location of osteonecrotic knee lesions and the likelihood of joint collapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 109 patients with hematologic malignancies and MRI-confirmed knee osteonecrosis. The median age was 11.5 years (range, 2.3-18.8 years) at primary diagnosis of hematologic malignancy and a median age of 13.4 years (range, 2.7-23.3 years) at diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the knee. For analyses, we used the first and last MR images. Minimum clinical followup was 2.3 years after diagnosis of knee osteonecrosis (median, 6 years; range, 2.3-7.17 years). RESULTS: Joint collapse occurred in 22% (24 of 109).

Here, we examine susceptibility of various leukemia cell lines (HL-60, U937, K562, CCRF-CEM, CEM-CM3, and THP-1) to an anti-DR4 agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb), AY4, in comparison with TRAIL. While most of the leukemia cell lines were intrinsically resistant to AY4 or TRAIL alone, the two T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) lines, CEM-CM3 and CCRF-CEM cells, underwent synergistic caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death by combination of AY4 or TRAIL with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), either suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or valproic acid (VPA). All of the combined treatments synergistically downregulated several anti-apoptotic proteins (c-FLIP, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), XIAP, and survivin) without significant changing the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bak) or the receptors (DR4 and DR5). Downregulation of c-FLIP to activate caspase-8 was a critical step for the synergistic apoptosis through both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Our results demonstrate that the HDACIs have synergistic effects on DR4-specific mAb AY4-mediated cell death in the T-ALL cells with comparable competence to those exerted by TRAIL, providing a new strategy for the targeted treatment of human T-ALL cells.","['Sung, Eun-Sil', 'Kim, Aeyung', 'Park, Joon Seong', 'Chung, Junho', 'Kwon, Myung-Hee', 'Kim, Yong-Sung']","['Sung ES', 'Kim A', 'Park JS', 'Chung J', 'Kwon MH', 'Kim YS']","['Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, San5, Woncheon-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon, 443-749, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-010-0521-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2010 Oct;15(10):1256-69. doi: 10.1007/s10495-010-0521-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental studies have not provided any mechanism for such effects, although at flux density levels significantly higher than the ones encountered in epidemiological studies, radical homoeostasis and levels of stress response proteins can be affected. Here, we report on the influence of MF exposure (50-Hz sine wave; 1 h; 0.025-0.10 mT; vertical or horizontal MF exposure direction) on different cellular parameters (proliferation, cell cycle distribution, superoxide radical anion, and HSP70 protein levels) in the human leukaemia cell line K562. The positive control heat treatment (42 degrees C, 1 h) did not affect either cell proliferation or superoxide radical anion production but caused accumulation of cells in the G2 phase and increased the stress protein HSP70. MF exposure (0.10 mT, 1 h) did not affect either cell cycle kinetics or proliferation. Both vertical and horizontal MF exposures for 1 h caused significantly and transiently increased HSP70 levels (>twofold), at several flux densities, compared to sham controls and also compared to heat treatment. This exposure also increased (30-40%) the levels of the superoxide radical anion, comparable to the positive control PMA. Addition of free radical scavengers (melatonin or 1,10-phenantroline) inhibited the MF-induced increase in HSP70. In conclusion, an early response to ELF MF in K562 cells seems to be an increased amount of oxygen radicals, leading to HSP70 induction. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is a flux density threshold where 50-Hz MF exerts its effects on K562 cells, at or below 0.025 mT, and also that it is the MF, and not the induced electric field, which is the active parameter.","['Mannerling, Ann-Christine', 'Simko, Myrtill', 'Mild, Kjell Hansson', 'Mattsson, Mats-Olof']","['Mannerling AC', 'Simko M', 'Mild KH', 'Mattsson MO']","['Life Science Center, Academy of Natural Sciences and Technology, Orebro University, Orebro, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100626,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,"['*Anions', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*chemistry', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Melatonin/pharmacology', 'Oxygen/chemistry', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', '*Superoxides', 'Temperature']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-010-0306-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2010 Nov;49(4):731-41. doi: 10.1007/s00411-010-0306-0.

This report describes the population pharmacokinetics of clofarabine and its metabolite 6-ketoclofarabine in adult and pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. Clofarabine pharmacokinetics were best described by a 2-compartment model with linear elimination and first-order absorption after oral administration. Clofarabine was rapidly absorbed following oral administration with a mean absorption time of less than 2 h and bioavailability of 57.5%. The important covariates affecting clofarabine pharmacokinetics were age, weight, and estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCL). No difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between sexes, races, or disease type. The elimination half-life was dependent on all the covariates but was generally less than 7 h in all cases. A difference in clofarabine pharmacokinetics was observed between adults and children. For a pediatric patient 3 years old weighing 16 kg with an eCrCL of 138 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the population estimates for total systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state were 18.3 L/h (1.14 L/h/kg) and 92.9 L (5.81 L/kg), respectively. alpha- and beta-half-life were 0.9 and 4.4 h, respectively. For an elderly patient 82 years old weighing 96 kg with an eCrCL of 46 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the population estimates for CL and Vdss were 21.5 L/h (0.22 L/h/kg) and 257.4 L (268 L/kg), respectively. alpha- and beta-half-life were 0.5 and 10.6 h, respectively. Because of the difference in pharmacokinetics, adults have higher exposure than children given a similar dose standardized to body surface area. The exact mechanism of this difference is not understood. As eCrCL decreased, exposure increased due to reduced total systemic clearance. In the case of moderate (eCrCL 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and severe (eCrCL <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) renal impairment, dose reduction may be needed to maintain similar exposure in an equivalent patient of the same age, weight, and normal renal function after both oral and intravenous administration. 6-Ketoclofarabine was a minor metabolite with peak plasma concentrations occurring about 1 h after the start of the infusion and having a metabolite ratio averaging less than 5% and not more than 8% for any particular individual. 6-Ketoclofarabine was rapidly cleared from plasma with an average apparent half-life of 4.9 h (range 3.9 to 6.2 h). No accumulation of 6-ketoclofarabine was observed with predose samples all below the limit of quantification on Days 8 and 15. Further monitoring of 6-ketoclofarabine is not required in future studies.","['Bonate, Peter L', 'Cunningham, Casey C', 'Gaynon, Paul', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Kadota, Richard', 'Lam, Gilbert N', 'Razzouk, Bassem', 'Rytting, Michael', 'Steinherz, Peter', 'Weitman, Steve']","['Bonate PL', 'Cunningham CC', 'Gaynon P', 'Jeha S', 'Kadota R', 'Lam GN', 'Razzouk B', 'Rytting M', 'Steinherz P', 'Weitman S']","['Genzyme Corporation, 4545 Horizon Hill Boulevard, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. peter.bonate@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20100626,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Creatinine/blood/urine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-010-1376-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2011 Apr;67(4):875-90. doi: 10.1007/s00280-010-1376-z.

Recent studies revealed a protective effect of thymoquinone, a non-toxic constituent of the essential oil of Nigella sativa, against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. We now investigated the influence of thymoquinone on various other effects exerted by doxorubicin in human cancer cells. METHODS: Doxorubicin, thymoquinone and equimolar mixtures of both were tested for cytotoxicity on human cells of HL-60 leukaemia, 518A2 melanoma, HT-29 colon, KB-V1 cervix, and MCF-7 breast carcinomas as well as multi-drug-resistant variants thereof and on non-malignant human fibroblasts (HF). Apoptosis induction was analysed via DNA fragmentation, activity studies of the caspases-3, -8 and -9, determination of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and in the ratio of the mRNA expressions of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins bax and bcl-2. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by the NBT assay. RESULTS: Thymoquinone improved the anti-cancer properties of doxorubicin in a cell line-specific manner. We found a significant rise of the growth inhibition by doxorubicin in HL-60 and multi-drug-resistant MCF-7/TOPO cells when thymoquinone had been added. The mode of action of both drugs and of their mixture was mainly apoptotic. In HL-60 cells, the drug mixture caused an additional concentration maximum of effector caspase-3 not observed for either of the pure drugs. The impact of the drug mixture on the mitochondria of HL-60 cells was also greater than those of the individual quinones alone. In addition, the drug mixture led to a higher concentration of reactive oxygen species in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, thymoquinone is a booster for the anti-cancer effect of doxorubicin in certain cancer cell lines. Distinct improvements on efficacy, selectivity, and even breaches of multi-drug resistance were observed for equimolar mixtures of doxorubicin and thymoquinone.","['Effenberger-Neidnicht, Katharina', 'Schobert, Rainer']","['Effenberger-Neidnicht K', 'Schobert R']","['Organisch-chemisches Laboratorium der Universitat Bayreuth, Universitatsstrasse 30, NW 1, 95447 Bayreuth, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100626,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-010-1386-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2011 Apr;67(4):867-74. doi: 10.1007/s00280-010-1386-x.

The multidrug resistance gene, MDR1, and its gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are an important determinant of MDR. Therefore, there is an urgent need for development of novel compounds that are not substrates of P-glycoprotein and are effective against drug-resistant cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this present study, we have synthesized a novel, redox active Fe (II) complex (chelate), iron N- (2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate (FeNG). The structure of the complex has been determined by spectroscopic means. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of FeNG we used doxorubicin resistant and/or sensitive T lymphoblastic leukemia cells and show that FeNG kills both the cell types irrespective of their MDR phenotype. Moreover, FeNG induces apoptosis in doxorubicin resistance T lymphoblastic leukemia cell through mitochondrial pathway via generation reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is substantiated by the fact that the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) could completely block ROS generation and, subsequently, abrogated FeNG induced apoptosis. Therefore, FeNG induces the doxorubicin resistant T lymphoblastic leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis and thus overcome MDR. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides evidence that FeNG, a redox active metal chelate may be a promising new therapeutic agent against drug resistance cancers.","['Ganguly, Avishek', 'Basu, Soumya', 'Chakraborty, Paramita', 'Chatterjee, Shilpak', 'Sarkar, Avijit', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Choudhuri, Soumitra Kumar']","['Ganguly A', 'Basu S', 'Chakraborty P', 'Chatterjee S', 'Sarkar A', 'Chatterjee M', 'Choudhuri SK']","['Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0011253 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jun 22;5(6):e11253. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011253.,,,,PMC2889820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there may be certain applications for replication competent HIV based vector systems, and we will review our activities in this particular field. This includes the generation of a conditionally replicating HIV 1 variant as a safe live attenuated virus vaccine, the construction of mini HIV variants as cancer selective viruses for virotherapy against leukemia, and the use of a conditionally live anti HIV gene therapy vector.

CD40 stimulation of PB CLL cells in vitro results in chemoresistance and provides a partial model for the LN microenvironment. The TLR9 ligand CpG induces proliferation in immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain-unmutated CLL, but apoptosis in immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain-mutated CLL. To juxtapose proliferative with antiapoptotic signals, we investigated the effects of CpG in the context of CD40 ligation in mutated versus unmutated CLL cells in this study. Prolonged CD40 ligation induced classical, followed by alternative nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activity in both subgroups, correlating with enhanced Bfl-1 and Bcl-X(L) levels, respectively. A dichotomy in NF-kappaB signaling occurred on combined CD40/TLR9 triggering. This induced declining p52 and Bcl-X(L) levels, and reversed chemoresistance only in mutated cells, whereas unmutated cells proliferated, maintained p52 and Bcl-X(L) and remained chemoresistant. The pivotal contribution of Bcl-X(L) to chemoresistance was shown by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and RNA interference. Finally, in ex vivo LN samples, p52, p65 and Bcl-X(L) levels were highly expressed, corroborating the in vitro findings. Thus, a distinction in NF-kappaB activation and drug susceptibility in mutated versus unmutated (LN-like) CLL cells was uncovered, which was causally linked to Bcl-X(L) levels.","['Tromp, J M', 'Tonino, S H', 'Elias, J A', 'Jaspers, A', 'Luijks, D M', 'Kater, A P', 'van Lier, R A W', 'van Oers, M H J', 'Eldering, E']","['Tromp JM', 'Tonino SH', 'Elias JA', 'Jaspers A', 'Luijks DM', 'Kater AP', 'van Lier RA', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.m.tromp@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100628,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CpG ODN 2006)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'CD40 Antigens/*agonists/metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mutation/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*agonists/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism/physiology']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010248 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.248 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Sep 9;29(36):5071-82. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.248.

In MOZ (MOnocytic leukemia Zinc-finger protein)/CBP- or mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemias, abnormal levels of HOX transcription factors have been found to be critical for leukemogenesis. We show that MOZ and MLL cooperate to regulate these key genes in human cord blood CD34+ cells. These chromatin-modifying enzymes interact, colocalize and functionally cooperate, and both are recruited to multiple HOX promoters. We also found that WDR5, an adaptor protein essential for lysine 4 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K4me3) by MLL, colocalizes and interacts with MOZ. We detected the binding of the HAT MOZ to H3K4me3, thus linking histone methylation to acetylation. In CD34+ cells, depletion of MLL causes release of MOZ from HOX promoters, which is correlated to defective histone activation marks, leading to repression of HOX gene expression and alteration of commitment of CD34+ cells into myeloid progenitors. Thus, our results unveil the role of the interaction between MOZ and MLL in CD34+ cells in which both proteins have a critical role in hematopoietic cell-fate decision, suggesting a new molecular mechanism by which MOZ or MLL deregulation leads to leukemogenesis.","['Paggetti, J', 'Largeot, A', 'Aucagne, R', 'Jacquel, A', 'Lagrange, B', 'Yang, X-J', 'Solary, E', 'Bastie, J-N', 'Delva, L']","['Paggetti J', 'Largeot A', 'Aucagne R', 'Jacquel A', 'Lagrange B', 'Yang XJ', 'Solary E', 'Bastie JN', 'Delva L']","['Inserm UMR 866, Faculty of Medicine, University of Burgundy, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100628,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/physiology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'U937 Cells']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010254 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.254 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Sep 9;29(36):5019-31. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.254.

METHODS: Apoptosis, Fas expression, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential in K652 cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. K562 cells were labeled with CFSE. The cytotoxic effect of expanded CIK cells on CFSE-labeled K562 cells was determined by FACS flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with TCA 180 micromol/L for 9 h induced apoptosis in 8.9%+/-1.23% of K562 cells. Treatment with 120 or 180 micromol/L TCA for 24 h significantly increased the apoptotic cells to 18.63%+/-1.42 % and 38.98%+/-2.74%, respectively. TCA significantly upregulates Fas expression and decreases mitochondrial transmembrane potential in K562 cells. TCA treatment at 120 and 180 micromol/L for 9 h enhanced the percentage of lysis of K562 cells by expanded CIK cells from 34.84%+/-2.13% to 48.21%+/-2.22 % and 64.81%+/-3.22% at the E:F ratio of 25:1 and from 49.26%+/-3.22% to 57.81%+/-5.13% and 73.36%+/-5.98% at E:F ratio of 50:1. CONCLUSION: TCA exerts cytotoxic effects on human leukemia K562 cells by inducing apoptosis and synergizing the cytotoxicity of CIK cells against K562 cells.

Because TLD has been the most-commonly used technique in the skin dose measurement of TBI, the aim of the present study is to prove the benefit of using the mobile MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) dosimeter, for entrance dose measurements during the total body irradiation (TBI) over thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD). MATERIAL/METHODS: The measurements involved 10 pediatric patients ages between 3 and 14 years. Thermoluminescent dosimeters and MOSFET dosimetry were performed at 9 different anatomic sites on each patient. RESULTS: The present results show there is a variation between skin dose measured with MOSFET and TLD in all patients, and for every anatomic site selected, there is no significant difference in the dose delivered using MOSFET as compared to the prescribed dose. However, there is a significant difference for every anatomic site using TLD compared with either the prescribed dose or MOSFET. The results indicate that the dosimeter measurements using the MOSFET gave precise measurements of prescribed dose. However, TLD measurement showed significant increased skin dose of cGy as compared to either prescribed dose or MOSFET group. CONCLUSIONS: MOSFET dosimeters provide superior dose accuracy for skin dose measurement in TBI as compared with TLD.","['Al-Mohammed, Huda I', 'Mahyoub, Fareed H', 'Moftah, Belal A']","['Al-Mohammed HI', 'Mahyoub FH', 'Moftah BA']","['Department of Biomedical Physics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', '*Semiconductors', 'Skin/*radiation effects', 'Thermoluminescent Dosimetry/*methods', '*Transistors, Electronic', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['880927 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2010 Jul;16(7):CR325-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such activating point mutation is the N822K replacement in the c-Kit protein. Here we investigate the selective cytotoxic effect of binase--RNase from Bacillus intermedius--on FDC-P1-N822K cells. These cells were derived from myeloid progenitor FDC-P1 cells, in which ectopic expression of N822K c-kit gene induces interleukin-3 independent growth. In order to determine whether the sensitivity of these cells to binase is caused by the expression of c-kit oncogene, the cytotoxicity of the RNase was studied in the presence of selective inhibitor of mutated c-Kit imatinib (Gleevec). Inhibition of mutated c-Kit protein leads to the loss of cell sensitivity to the apoptotic effect of binase, while the latter still decreases the amount of cellular RNA. Using green fluorescent protein as an expression marker for the c-Kit oncoprotein, we demonstrate that the elimination of c-Kit is the key factor in selective cytotoxicity of binase. Quantitative RT-PCR with RNA samples isolated from the binase-treated FDC-P1-N822K cells shows that binase treatment results in 41% reduction in the amount of small es, Cyrillic-kit mRNA. This indicates that the transcript of the activated mutant c-kit is the target for toxic action of binase. Thus, the combination of inhibition of oncogenic protein with the destruction of its mRNA is a promising approach to eliminating malignant cells.","['Mitkevich, Vladimir A', 'Petrushanko, Irina Y', 'Kretova, Olga V', 'Zelenikhin, Pavel V', 'Prassolov, Vladimir S', 'Tchurikov, Nickolai A', 'Ilinskaya, Olga N', 'Makarov, Alexander A']","['Mitkevich VA', 'Petrushanko IY', 'Kretova OV', 'Zelenikhin PV', 'Prassolov VS', 'Tchurikov NA', 'Ilinskaya ON', 'Makarov AA']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.1 (ribonuclease T(2))']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bacillus/drug effects/enzymology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endoribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/06/16 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['12150 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.13.12150 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Jul 1;9(13):2674-8. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.13.12150.,,,,,['(c) 2010 Landes Bioscience'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The miR-34 family was demonstrated to be induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and to elicit p53-like responses like senescence, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis depending on the cell type. We have shown in a recent paper that miR-34a is severely increased in the TCL1-mouse model of CLL. This finding was reflected in human CLL. Moreover, it is demonstrated that its expression is dependent on the presence of the SNP309 in the intronic promoter of the MDM2 gene. In addition, low miR-34a expression was associated with shorter time to treatment (log-rank p = 0.003) in CLL. When reintroduced into CLL cells, miR-34a was able to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, this was dependent on an intact p53 pathway. Here, we present data showing that knockdown of p53 in HCT-116 cells severely reduces miR-34a induced apoptosis.

The aim of our study was to analyse the relationship between linezolid use and an outbreak of linezolid-resistant CoNS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 27 infection or colonization events. Eleven isolates were available for supplemental investigation; species identification, clonal relatedness and linezolid resistance mutation analysis. The medical records of the affected patients were reviewed and linezolid utilization data were obtained from the pharmacy. RESULTS: Available isolates were confirmed as clonally related Staphylococcus epidermidis. Partial 23S rRNA gene sequencing found a G2576T mutation in all of the isolates tested. All patients received linezolid within 3 months prior to an event. Patients without a prior hospitalization had a longer time from admission to event; 29 versus 3.5 days (P = 0.002). The outbreak was preceded by a 51% increase in inpatient linezolid utilization and 64% of affected patients belonged to the leukaemia service, which had a utilization rate 3.1 times that of the other services (95% confidence interval: 2.96-3.23). CONCLUSIONS: Increased linezolid utilization preceded the appearance of a linezolid-resistant CoNS clone. Patients probably acquired the clonal strain nosocomially, given the longer time from admission to event among patients with no previous admission to the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Linezolid administration then selected this strain, since all patients received linezolid prior to an event. A linezolid utilization rate of >or=13 defined daily doses/100 patient-days was similar to that reported in two other outbreaks and may be the threshold required to generate an outbreak.","['Mulanovich, Victor E', 'Huband, Michael D', 'McCurdy, Sandra P', 'Lemmon, M Megan', 'Lescoe, Marykay', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Rolston, Kenneth V I', 'LaSala, P Rocco']","['Mulanovich VE', 'Huband MD', 'McCurdy SP', 'Lemmon MM', 'Lescoe M', 'Jiang Y', 'Rolston KV', 'LaSala PR']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 1460, Houston, TX 77030, USA. vmulanov@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100625,England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Coagulase)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Oxazolidinones)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 23S)', 'ISQ9I6J12J (Linezolid)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coagulase/analysis', 'DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal/chemistry/genetics', '*Disease Outbreaks', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Linezolid', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', 'Oxazolidinones/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 23S/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/*drug effects/enzymology/isolation & purification', 'United States/epidemiology']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['dkq238 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkq238 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Sep;65(9):2001-4. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkq238.

In the present study, our aim was to explore the roles of Bcl-xL overexpression and determine its possibility as a therapeutic target in human osteosarcoma. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot or immunohistochemistry assays were performed to detect the expression of Bcl-xL mRNA and protein in human osteosarcoma cell lines or tissue samples. The expression of other Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bim and Bik) in osteosarcoma tissues was also detected by immunohistochemistry. The associations of Bcl-xL mRNA expression with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of osteosarcoma patients were evaluated. RNA interference or gene overexpression technologies were employed to downregulate or upregulate endogenous Bcl-xL expression in osteosarcoma cells and the effects of Bcl-xL downregulation or upregulation on phenotypes and chemo- or radiosensitivity of human osteosarcoma cells were analyzed. Finally, the mechanism of synergistic effects of Bcl-xL downregulation and chemo- or radiotherapy was explored by detecting the activity of caspase-3. The expression levels of Bcl-xL mRNA and protein in high metastatic osteosarcoma cells showed higher than those in low metastatic osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, the levels of Bcl-xL mRNA expression were significantly higher in osteosarcoma tissues than those in chondroma or corresponding non-tumor tissues (P<0.01), and osteosarcoma tissues showed stronger immunostaining of Bcl-xL protein than non-tumor tissues. The stronger staining of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins was also observed, while the staining of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bim and Bik) was significantly weaker or not detected in osteosarcoma tissues. The higher levels of Bcl-xL mRNA expression were significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.005) or hematogenous metastasis (P=0.001) of osteosarcoma patients. Osteosarcoma patients with higher Bcl-xL mRNA expression showed a poorer survival compared with those with lower expression (P=0.039). Bcl-xL downregulation or upregulation could significantly reduce or increase the proliferation capacity of osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, Bcl-xL downregulation could significantly enhance in vitro chemo- or radiosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells, which might be associated with elevated activity of caspase-3. Taken together, overexpression of Bcl-xL may play important roles in osteosarcoma progression and this molecule will be a potential chemo- or radiotherapeutic molecular target for osteosarcoma therapy.","['Wang, Zhao-Xia', 'Yang, Jin-Song', 'Pan, Xuan', 'Wang, Ji-Rong', 'Li, Juan', 'Yin, Yong-Mei', 'De, Wei']","['Wang ZX', 'Yang JS', 'Pan X', 'Wang JR', 'Li J', 'Yin YM', 'De W']","['Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121 Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, PR China. wangzhaox@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100523,United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Osteosarcoma/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S8756-3282(10)01260-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2010.05.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2010 Aug;47(2):445-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2010.05.027.

Inability to maintain nutrition can lead to poor tolerance of treatment, increased risk of infectious complications and a potential poorer overall outcome. Good nutritional support is vital however there does not appear to be a national or consistent approach to either nutritional support or assessment. PURPOSE: The Paediatric Oncology Nurses Forum of the Royal College of Nursing and the Paediatric Oncology Dieticians Interest Group surveyed practice in the 21 Children Cancer and Leukaemia Group Centres in the United Kingdom and Ireland with the express aim of reviewing current practice as a first stage towards developing national guidance for nutritional management. METHODS AND SAMPLE: Questionnaires designed to review nutritional assessment and nutritional interventions were distributed to both a nurse and dietician in each CCLG centre. The results were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There was a 100% return rate from nurses and 66% from dieticians. The results showed an inconsistent approach in both assessment methods and approaches to nutritional intervention for this group of patients. CONCLUSION: It is recognised that there is a need to adequately assess and provide appropriate nutrition for children and young people receiving cancer therapies. This survey highlights the inconsistencies in practice today as well as the need for consistent and useful guidance especially in the area of nutritional assessment and management of potential malnutrition.","['Selwood, Karen', 'Ward, Evelyn', 'Gibson, Faith']","['Selwood K', 'Ward E', 'Gibson F']","[""Oncology Unit, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Eaton Road, Liverpool L12 2AP, UK.

In the present study we have analyzed the effect of six different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), belonging to the four classic structural families, on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in leukemic T cell lines. Non-toxic and functional doses of all HDACi but apicidin, similarly sensitized different leukemic T cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, while they showed no effect on the resistance of normal T lymphocytes. Sensitizing doses of vorinostat, valproic acid, sodium butyrate and MS-275 regulated the expression of TRAIL-R2, c-FLIP and Apaf-1 in leukemic cells while TSA modulated only the expression of Apaf-1. The synergistic effect of all HDACi and TRAIL was inhibited in Bcl-2-overexpressing leukemic T cells. Thus, different HDACi may affect the expression of different TRAIL-related genes, but regulation of the mitochondrial pathway seems to be essential for the TRAIL sensitizing effect of HDACi in leukemic T cells. Overall, HDACi represent a promising and safe strategy in combination with TRAIL for treatment of T-cell leukaemia.","['Morales, J C', 'Ruiz-Magana, M J', 'Carranza, D', 'Ortiz-Ferron, G', 'Ruiz-Ruiz, C']","['Morales JC', 'Ruiz-Magana MJ', 'Carranza D', 'Ortiz-Ferron G', 'Ruiz-Ruiz C']","['IBIMER, Universidad de Granada, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100523,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/metabolism', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(10)00253-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2010.04.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 Nov 1;297(1):91-100. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2010.04.029.

Herein we review the limits of currently available transplant therapies and the innovative strategies being developed to overcome resistance to therapy or to fill therapeutic modalities not currently available. These novel strategies include nonimmunologic therapies, such as targeted preparative regimens and posttransplant drug therapy, as well as immunologic interventions, including graft engineering, donor lymphocyte infusions, T cell engineering, vaccination, and dendritic cell-based approaches. Several aspects of the biology of the malignant cells as well as the host have been identified that obviate success of even these newer strategies. To maximize the potential for success, we recommend pursuing research to develop additional targeted therapies to be used in the preparative regimen or as maintenance posttransplant, better characterize the T cell and dendritic cells subsets involved in graft-versus-host disease and the graft-versus-leukemia/tumor effect, identify strategies for timing immunologic or nonimmunologic therapies to eliminate the noncycling cancer stem cell, identify more targets for immunotherapies, develop new vaccines that will not be limited by HLA, and develop methods to identify populations at very high risk for relapse to accelerate clinical development and avoid toxicity in patients not at risk for relapse.","['Alyea, Edwin P', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Moldrem, Jeffrey', 'Pagel, John M', 'Przepiorka, Donna', 'Sadelin, Michel', 'Young, James W', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Bishop, Michael', 'Riddell, Stan']","['Alyea EP', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Moldrem J', 'Pagel JM', 'Przepiorka D', 'Sadelin M', 'Young JW', 'Giralt S', 'Bishop M', 'Riddell S']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. edwin_alyea@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100524,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00217-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Aug;16(8):1037-69. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.005.

We designed four immunotoxins, SPRSV1 was designed to code for a single protein of DT (390) and IL2 (133) without any extra amino acids at the junction. SPRSV2 was designed to selectively target low affinity IL2R, it codes for DT (390) and IL2 (69).

The cytotoxic activities of these immunotoxins were tested in various cell lines, cell lines lacking IL2R expression and healthy MNC were used as controls. The activities of SPRSV1 and SPRSV2 were comparable to that of SPRSV4. SPRSV2 exhibited potent cytotoxicity effectively targeted to alpha subunit of IL2R on various leukemia cell lines.

Piceatannol-induced apoptotic death of human leukemia U937 cells was characterized by increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), ERK inactivation, p38 MPAK activation, degradation of procaspase-8 and production of t-Bid. Piceatannol treatment increased Fas and FasL protein expression, and up-regulated transcription of Fas and FasL mRNA. Down-regulation of FADD blocked piceatannol-induced procaspase-8 degradation and rescued viability of piceatannol-treated cells. Abolition of piceatannol-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i abrogated p38 MAPK activation and up-regulation of Fas and FasL expression, but restored ERK activation and viability of piceatannol-treated cells. Suppression of p38alpha MAPK or transfection of constitutively active MEK1 abolished piceatannol-induced Fas and FasL up-regulation. Piceatannol treatment repressed ERK-mediated c-Fos phosphorylation but evoked p38alpha MAPK-mediated c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation. Knockdown of c-Fos, c-Jun and ATF-2 by siRNA reflected that c-Fos attenuated the effect of c-Jun and ATF-2 on Fas/FasL up-regulation. Taken together, our data indicate that Fas/FasL up-regulation in piceatannol-treated U937 cells is elicited by Ca(2+)/p38alpha MAPK-mediated activation of c-Jun and ATF-2, and suggest that autocrine Fas-mediated apoptotic mechanism is involved in piceatannol-induced cell death.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100516,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(10)00174-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2010.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2010 Sep;42(9):1498-506. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2010.05.007.

Aberrant expression of the adhesion receptor CD44 correlates with poor prognosis in various neoplasms. To evaluate the prognostic impact of CD44 in MDS serum levels of soluble CD44 standard (solCD44s) were measured in 130 MDS patients (median age 68 years) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). solCD44s levels were significantly elevated in MDS patients as compared to those of healthy donors (p<0.001) and were found to correlate with distinct FAB and WHO subtypes. The highest levels of solCD44s were found in patients with CMML, in RAEB and in patients with MDS transformed into secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In univariate analysis elevated levels of solCD44s (cut-off level>688.5ng/ml) correlated significantly with shorter overall survival in MDS patients (12 versus 39 months; p<0.001). In multivariate analysis solCD44s displayed prognostic significance independent of the International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS). To test for refined prognostication, IPSS risk groups were split into two separate categories based on the solCD44s levels. Using this approach, MDS patients with a shorter survival were identified both in the IPSS low-risk (p=0.037) and in the IPSS intermediate-1-risk group (p=0.015). The CD44s-adjusted IPSS defines a cohort of MDS patients with unfavorable prognosis, which might be helpful in risk stratification and in therapeutic algorithms.","['Loeffler-Ragg, J', 'Germing, U', 'Sperr, W R', 'Herrmann, H', 'Zwierzina, H', 'Valent, P', 'Ulmer, H', 'Stauder, R']","['Loeffler-Ragg J', 'Germing U', 'Sperr WR', 'Herrmann H', 'Zwierzina H', 'Valent P', 'Ulmer H', 'Stauder R']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100626,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(10)00140-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2011 May;78(2):150-61. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.05.008.

The patient suffered from intermittent inflammatory back pain and peripheral joint swelling for several years and did not find relief through multiple emergency room visits at different medical facilities. After a thorough history and physical exam, it was noted that our patient had developed signs of axial disease along with dactylitis and overall that he had been insidiously developing an undifferentiated spondyloarthopathy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

It is known that Wnt proteins are overexpressed in primary CLL cells and several physiological inhibitors are partly inactivated in this disease. Furthermore, beta-catenin is upregulated upon Wnt stimulation and cooperates with the transcription factor lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF-1). LEF-1 is excessively overexpressed in CLL cells by more than 3,000-fold compared to normal B cells. Moreover, LEF-1 could be identified as an important regulator of pathophysiologically relevant genes in CLL, and several Wnt/beta-catenin signaling components substantially influence CLL cell survival. In this review we summarize the current state of knowledge about Wnt/beta-catenin/LEF-1 signaling in CLL. Following a short overview of current treatment concepts in CLL, we briefly describe Wnt signaling in human cancers. We then discuss recent progress in understanding regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin/LEF-1 signaling pathway in this disease. Based on the present scientific evidence we highlight which components of this important signaling pathway could serve as therapeutic targets in CLL. We then present previous results gained from experimental approaches to target different parts of the Wnt/beta-catenin/LEF-1 cascade. Together with potentially promising approaches we also critically reflect on the kind of difficulties and problems that may arise using such strategies.","['Gandhirajan, R K', 'Poll-Wolbeck, S J', 'Gehrke, I', 'Kreuzer, K-A']","['Gandhirajan RK', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Gehrke I', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/06/29 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2009/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['EPub-Abstract-CCDT-63 [pii]', '10.2174/156800910793605794 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2010 Nov;10(7):716-27. doi: 10.2174/156800910793605794.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They occur frequently together in the same individual. This disease combination is denominated as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant (APS3v). This review aims to describe the genetic and pathological background of the syndrome. The joint susceptibility genes for AITD and T1D as well as the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to the development of autoimmunity are summarized. SUMMARY: Family and population studies showed that the APS3v syndrome has a strong genetic background. Whole genome and candidate gene approaches identified several gene variations that are present in both AITD and T1D. Most important common disease susceptibility genes are human leucocyte antigen (chromosome 6), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (chromosome 2), protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (chromosome 1), forkhead box P3 (X chromosome), and the interleukin-2 receptor alpha/CD25 gene region (chromosome 10), all of which contributing to the susceptibility to APS3v. With respect to the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, these genes are altogether involved in the immune regulation, in particular in the immunological synapse and T-cell activation. In addition to these common genes, there are further candidate genes with joint risk for AITD and T1D, in particular the v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 gene (chromosome 12) and C-type lectin domain family 16 member A gene (chromosome 16). The latter one might be involved in pathogen recognition. CONCLUSIONS: AITD and T1D share common susceptibility gene variants that possibly act pleiotropically as risk factors for the development of autoimmunity in APS3v. The functional consequences of the genetic variants as well as their interactions should be explored in greater detail. In particular, the functional consequences of the variants of forkhead box P3 predisposing to APS3v need to be elucidated. Finally, further large-scale genome-wide associations studies of single-nucleotide polymorphism variations capturing many thousand individual genetic profiles are warranted to identify further genes that are linked to the etiology of APS3v.","['Dittmar, Manuela', 'Kahaly, George J']","['Dittmar M', 'Kahaly GJ']","['Department of Human Biology, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/complications/genetics/physiopathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Multifactorial Inheritance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyendocrinopathies, Autoimmune/epidemiology/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Prevalence', 'Thyroid Diseases/complications/genetics']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2010.1639 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2010 Jul;20(7):737-43. doi: 10.1089/thy.2010.1639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current combinations are reaching the limits of tolerability and effectiveness. As the major toxicities of treatment are myelosuppression and opportunistic infections, the choice of additional agents to add to current combinations must focus on agents with reduced propensity to these complications, as well as agents that have novel mechanisms of action distinct from DNA damage. In addition, patients with comorbid conditions have not benefited from recent developments in combination treatment due to poor tolerance of chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Therefore, we seek to review the mechanism of activity and therapeutic results of the most promising novel agents in CLL, in order to determine how these agents may be best incorporated into future treatment algorithms of both younger/fit patients and patients with comorbidities.","['Bazargan, Ali', 'Tam, Constantine S']","['Bazargan A', 'Tam CS']","[""Hematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.497885 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Sep;51(9):1596-611. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.497885.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, significant amounts of tryptases have been shown to be produced by myeloblasts in certain patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the function of secreted tryptases in pathological circumstances remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether beta-tryptase affects the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in AML. We detected the expression of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) on AML BMSCs and found that beta-tryptase significantly up-regulated VEGF mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner by real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. Furthermore, beta-tryptase increased ERK1/2 and p38MAPK phosphorylation, and pretreatment with FLLSY-NH(2), PD98059, and SB230580 (PAR-2, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK inhibitors, respectively) inhibited the beta-tryptase-induced production of VEGF.

Specifically Toxoplasma gondii infection is a life-threatening condition in immunocompromised patients. In order to highlight the difficulties in obtaining an early and definitive diagnosis, we report three cases of toxoplasmosis after HSCT for hematologic malignancies: two cases of T. gondii retinochoroiditis, and one case of encephalitis. All patients had unrelated donors and received antithymocyte globulin; none had received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. Toxoplasmosis occurred early post-transplant and diagnosis was obtained by real-time PCR. In one case, the correct diagnosis could only be established by PCR analysis of a retinal biopsy specimen. Rapid diagnosis--by invasive approaches--and an immediate onset of antiparasite treatment are crucial to avoid disseminated and often lethal Toxoplasma infections in the post-transplant period.

A cross-sectional study was made in 49 children with ALL between 2 and 14 years of age. To describe oral manifestations, a clinical diagnosis was made and the following criteria were applied: the OHI-S index to describe oral health and the IMPA index to describe periodontal conditions and to differentiate gingivitis from periodontitis. The prevalence of oral manifestations was: gingivitis, 91.84%; caries, 81.63%; mucositis, 38.77%; periodontitis, 16.32%; cheilitis, 18.36%; recurrent herpes, 12.24%; and primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, 2.04%. Other oral manifestations were: dry lips, mucosal pallor, mucosal petechiae, ecchymoses, and induced ulcers. The prevalence of oral candidiasis was 6.12%. It was observed that high risk ALL and poor oral hygiene were important risk factors for the development of candidiasis and gingivitis. The type of leukemia, gender and phase of chemotherapy were apparently associated with the presence of candidiasis, gingivitis, and periodontitis, and they could be considered risk factors for the development of oral manifestations.","['Ponce-Torres, Elena', 'Ruiz-Rodriguez, Ma del Socorro', 'Alejo-Gonzalez, Francisco', 'Hernandez-Sierra, Juan Francisco', 'Pozos-Guillen, Amaury de J']","['Ponce-Torres E', 'Ruiz-Rodriguez Mdel S', 'Alejo-Gonzalez F', 'Hernandez-Sierra JF', 'Pozos-Guillen Ade J']","['Pediatric Dentistry Postgraduate Program, Facultad de Estomatologia, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Pediatr Dent,The Journal of clinical pediatric dentistry,9100079,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis, Oral/epidemiology', 'Cheilitis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dental Caries/epidemiology', 'Ecchymosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gingivitis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lip Diseases/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Mouth Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Oral Ulcer/epidemiology', 'Periodontitis/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Purpura/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Stomatitis/epidemiology', 'Stomatitis, Herpetic/epidemiology']",2010/06/29 06:00,2010/08/19 06:00,['2010/06/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17796/jcpd.34.3.y060151580h301t7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pediatr Dent. 2010 Spring;34(3):275-9. doi: 10.17796/jcpd.34.3.y060151580h301t7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study is focused on the identification of differences in terms of PML protein expression between different types of soft tissue sarcoma and the corresponding normal surrounding tissue. PML protein expression has been assessed by immunohistochemistry in six different histologic types of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, angiosarcoma, liposarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma) and in the corresponding normal surrounding tissue. PML resulted significantly down-regulated in synovial sarcoma and in myofibroblastic sarcoma specimens. Also in angiosarcoma samples a significative difference in PML expression in comparison with normal specimens has been detected. Interestingly PML protein detection showed a different pattern of expression in the three liposarcoma histology types compared with corresponding nontumoral tissues. In particular PML protein resulted significantly down-regulated in myxoid liposarcoma and in dedifferentiated liposarcoma. On the contrary no statistically significant difference was observed in pleomorphic liposarcoma compared to normal tissue specimens. Further investigations are needed to confirm these data and to assess the possible value of PML expression as a prognostic factor in these extremely aggressive diseases.","['Vincenzi, Bruno', 'Perrone, Giuseppe', 'Santini, Daniele', 'Grosso, Federica', 'Silletta, Marianna', 'Frezza, Annamaria', 'Rossi, Sabrina', 'Russo, Antonio', 'Rabitti, Carla', 'Gebbia, Nicola', 'Badalamenti, Giuseppe', 'Casali, Paolo', 'Muda, Andrea Onetti', 'Dei Tos, Angelo Paolo', 'Tonini, Giuseppe']","['Vincenzi B', 'Perrone G', 'Santini D', 'Grosso F', 'Silletta M', 'Frezza A', 'Rossi S', 'Russo A', 'Rabitti C', 'Gebbia N', 'Badalamenti G', 'Casali P', 'Muda AO', 'Dei Tos AP', 'Tonini G']","['Department of Oncology, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['*Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sarcoma/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 Sep;224(3):644-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22161.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All 2487 patients diagnosed with CLL between January 1995 and June 2008 and cared for in the Mayo Clinic Division of Hematology were categorized by age at diagnosis and evaluated for differences in clinical characteristics, time to first treatment, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Among Rai stage 0 patients, survival was shorter than the age-matched general population for patients aged <55 years (P < .001), 55 to 64 years (P < .001), and 65 to 74 years (P < .001), but not those aged >/=75 years at diagnosis (P = not significant). CD38, IGHV mutation, and ZAP-70 each predicted time to first treatment independent of stage for all age groups (all P < .04), but had less value for predicting OS, particularly as age increased. IGHV and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) predicted OS independent of stage for patients aged <55 years (P </= .001), 55 to 64 years (P </= .004), and 65 to 74 years (P </= .001), but not those aged >/=75 years. CD38 and ZAP-70 each predicted OS independent of stage for only 2 of 4 age categories. Among Rai 0 patients aged <75 years, survival was shorter than the age-matched population only for IGHV unmutated (P < .001) patients or those with unfavorable FISH (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of CLL patients aged <75 years is shorter than the age-matched general population regardless of disease stage. Among patients aged <75 years, the simple combinations of stage and IGHV or stage and FISH identifies those with excess risk of death relative to the age-matched population. Although useful for predicting time to first treatment independent of stage for patients of all ages, prognostic testing had little utility for predicting OS independent of stage among patients aged >/=75 years.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Reinalda, Megan S', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Bowen, Debbie A', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Call, Timothy G']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Rabe KG', 'Kay NE', 'Zent CS', 'Jelinek DF', 'Reinalda MS', 'Schwager SM', 'Bowen DA', 'Slager SL', 'Hanson CA', 'Call TG']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55902, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['*Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25292 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Oct 15;116(20):4777-87. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25292.,,,"['CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA117573-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA117573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3902481,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS191491'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the authors investigated a putative correlation between interleukin (IL)-17 expression and HPV infection in clinical nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and examined the effects of HPV infection on a human NSCLC cell line. METHODS: IL-17 expression was investigated in 79 NSCLC tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Growth rate, IL-17 mRNA, and secreting protein levels were also examined in HPV 16/18 E6-transfected H1299 human NSCLC cells. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical data showed that 48.1% of lung tumors had IL-17 staining, which was significantly associated with patients' sex (P = .03), HPV infection (P = .002), and tumor stage (P = .03). Significant correlations of IL-17 with IL-6 (P < .001) and IL-17 with Mcl-1 (P < .001) expression were also observed. Cell growth rate was increased, and IL-17/Mcl-1 expression levels were elevated in HPV 16 E6-transfected H1299 cells. The transfected E6 oncoproteins can significantly up-regulate expression levels of IL-17 and antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that HPV infection-induced IL-17 levels can stimulate Mcl-1 expression through the PI3K pathway and promote lung tumor cell progression through a p53- and IL-6-independent pathway.","['Chang, Yih-Hsin', 'Yu, Chen-Wei', 'Lai, Li-Chuan', 'Tsao, Chang-Hui', 'Ho, Kuo-Ting', 'Yang, Shun-Chun', 'Lee, Huei', 'Cheng, Ya-Wen', 'Wu, Tzu-Chin', 'Shiau, Ming-Yuh']","['Chang YH', 'Yu CW', 'Lai LC', 'Tsao CH', 'Ho KT', 'Yang SC', 'Lee H', 'Cheng YW', 'Wu TC', 'Shiau MY']","['School of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*pharmacology', 'Papillomaviridae/genetics', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics', '*Up-Regulation']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25224 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Oct 15;116(20):4800-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25224.,,,,,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the xanthone derivatives exhibited a higher degree of cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells than on the other seven cancer cell lines. Compound 24 (1,3,7-Trihydroxy-12H-benzo[b] xanthen-12-one) showed the highest degree of cytotoxicity of the tested compounds against HepG2 cells and demonstrated good tumour specificity by exhibiting a much higher degree of cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells than against normal liver cells (L02). Several valuable structure-activity relationships were derived from the cytotoxicity data. In addition, we found that compound 24 could downregulate the expression of the Mcl-1 protein, induce changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells via the mitochondrial pathway. Compound 24 was also shown to inhibit topoisomerase (topo) II activity and downregulate the levels of both topo II mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells. The present results suggest that due to its potent cytotoxicity and good tumour selectivity, compound 24 may be exploited as a potential lead compound in the development of a new anti-tumour agent with specific activity against liver cancer.","['Su, Quan-Guan', 'Liu, Yan', 'Cai, Yu-Chen', 'Sun, Yue-Li', 'Wang, Bo', 'Xian, Li-Jian']","['Su QG', 'Liu Y', 'Cai YC', 'Sun YL', 'Wang B', 'Xian LJ']","[""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100626,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Xanthones)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xanthones/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2010/06/26 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9468-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2011 Dec;29(6):1230-40. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9468-5.

We therefore conducted a prospective multi-center open-label study of imatinib for Japanese patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML (CP-CML). A total of 107 patients were enrolled and treated with imatinib at an initial daily dose of 400 mg. Eighty-three patients completed 3 years of study treatment. The cumulative rates of major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) were 90.9 and 90.2% at 3 years, respectively. The safety profile was not very different from that reported in the IRIS study, although grade > or =3 neutropenia occurred relatively frequently (31.8 vs. 14.3%). Only seven patients discontinued the study due to adverse events, as did four patients due to insufficient efficacy. The 3-year probabilities of overall survival and progression-free survival were 93.2 and 91.4%, respectively. Higher average daily doses (i.e., > or =350 mg) were significantly associated not only with higher rates of achieving CCyR, but also with longer duration of CCyR.

Here we identified for the first time that 10 mM Tempo present during heating at 44 degrees C for 30 min rapidly induced autophagy in U937 leukemic cells in spite of Bax activation and mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeabilization. This co-treatment inhibited the processing of heat-activated procaspases-2, -8, -9 and -3 into active small subunits, leading to the inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis, and instead caused the induction of autophagy. The inactivation of caspases, a key event, could result from oxidation of active-site-CysSH of all caspases by a prooxidant oxo-ammonium cation, an intermediate derived Tempo during dismutation of heat-induced superoxide anion. In addition, the co-treatment caused mitochondrial calcium overloads, the mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization, profound mitochondrial dysfunction, and liberation of Beclin 1 from the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex, all of which contributed to induction of autophagy. These autophagic cells underwent propidium iodide-positive necrosis in a delayed fashion, leading to the complete proliferative inhibition. Remarkably, ruthenium red and BAPTA, which interfere with mitochondrial calcium uptake, facilitated autophagic necrotic death. Cyclosporin A, which binds to cyclophilin D, had a similar necrotic effect. 3-Methyladenine facilitated the necrosis of autophagic cells. In contrast, 5 mM Tempo-44 degrees C/10 min or 44 degrees C/30 min induced Bax-mediated MOM permeabilization and caspase-dependent apoptosis more potently than Tempo alone. Thus, Tempo is a unique thermosensitizer to synergistically induce apoptosis and autophagic cell death.","['Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Fujiwara, Yoshisada', 'Kondo, Takashi']","['Zhao QL', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani 2630, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GFQ4MMS07W (nitroxyl)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'VQN7359ICQ (TEMPO)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', '*Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Heat-Shock Response', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Nitrogen Oxides/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-010-0522-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2010 Oct;15(10):1270-83. doi: 10.1007/s10495-010-0522-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIRT1 has a diffuse nuclear localization but is recruited to the PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) after PML upregulation. However, the functions of SIRT1 in the PML-NBs are unknown. In this study we show that primary mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking SIRT1 contain reduced PML protein levels that are increased after reintroduction of SIRT1. In addition, overexpression of SIRT1 in HEK-293 cells increases the amount of PML protein whereas knockdown of SIRT1 reduces the size and number of PML-NBs and the levels of PML protein in HeLa cells.

The total number of nucleoids per cell is several hundred in cultured cells. Mitochondrial nucleoids, similarly to the whole mitochondrial network, have recently been successfully and extensively visualized using fluorescent and confocal microscopy. In the present work, we show high-resolution micrographs of mouse and human mitochondrial nucleoids obtained by transmission electron microscopy. Position in the mitochondria, size, general appearance and other properties of the human nucleoids appear the same as those of mouse nucleoids, and all observations are also in full agreement with the results obtained in different laboratories using different approaches. Most of nucleoids are located inside mitochondrial tubes. However, we show directly that certain part of the nucleoids close to inner membrane is bound to the complex of molecules that crosscut both, the inner and the outer mitochondrial membranes. Nucleoids in cells starving for serum are mostly more dense than those in dividing cells. We discuss the position, appearance and other properties of the nucleoids in relation to functional stage. Other electron-dense structures inside mitochondria that could be erroneously considered to be mitochondrial nucleoids are also described.","['Prachar, Jarmil']",['Prachar J'],"['Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovakia. jarmil.prachar@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,,IM,"['Animals', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Genome, Mitochondrial', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Species Specificity', 'Submitochondrial Particles/genetics/*ultrastructure']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2010 Jun;29(2):160-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory role of PHLPP-1 in the heart has not been considered. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that blockade/inhibition of PHLPP-1 could constitute a novel way to enhance Akt signals and provide cardioprotection. METHODS AND RESULTS: PHLPP-1 is expressed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and in adult mouse ventricular myocytes (AMVMs). PHLPP-1 knockdown by small interfering RNA significantly enhances phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) at Ser473, but not at Thr308, in NRVMs stimulated with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The increased phosphorylation is accompanied by greater Akt catalytic activity. PHLPP-1 knockdown enhances LIF-mediated cardioprotection against doxorubicin and also protects cardiomyocytes against H(2)O(2). Direct Akt effects at mitochondria have been implicated in cardioprotection and mitochondria/cytosol fractionation revealed a significant enrichment of PHLPP-1 at mitochondria. The ability of PHLPP-1 knockdown to potentiate LIF-mediated increases in p-Akt at mitochondria and an accompanying increase in mitochondrial hexokinase-II was demonstrated. We generated PHLPP-1 knockout (KO) mice and demonstrate that AMVMs isolated from KO mice show potentiated p-Akt at Ser473 in response to agonists. When isolated perfused hearts are subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, p-Akt in whole-heart homogenates and in the mitochondrial fraction is significantly increased. Additionally in PHLPP-1 KO hearts, the increase in p-Akt elicited by ischemia/reperfusion is potentiated and, concomitantly, infarct size is significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate PHLPP-1 as an endogenous negative regulator of Akt activity and cell survival in the heart.","['Miyamoto, Shigeki', 'Purcell, Nicole H', 'Smith, Jeffrey M', 'Gao, Tianyan', 'Whittaker, Ross', 'Huang, Katherine', 'Castillo, Rene', 'Glembotski, Chris C', 'Sussman, Mark A', 'Newton, Alexandra C', 'Brown, Joan Heller']","['Miyamoto S', 'Purcell NH', 'Smith JM', 'Gao T', 'Whittaker R', 'Huang K', 'Castillo R', 'Glembotski CC', 'Sussman MA', 'Newton AC', 'Brown JH']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0636, USA. smiyamoto@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100624,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Heart/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/*physiology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/deficiency/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Rats']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CIRCRESAHA.109.215020 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.215020 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2010 Aug 20;107(4):476-84. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.215020.

METHODS: Causes of death for 9267 males (6510 bus drivers, 2073 maintenance workers and 601 white collar workers) were coded according to ICD-9. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% CIs were computed by applying Italian and regional male death rates to person-years of observation for the entire cohort and following stratification by longest held job title and length of and time since first employment using the Poisson regression model. RESULTS: There were 2916 deaths and 230,009 person-years of observation; 17 subjects were lost to follow-up. SMRs for all causes, diseases of the circulatory, respiratory, digestive and genitourinary systems, and for accidents were lower than expected. SMRs (95% CI) were increased for lung cancer (1.16, 1.05 to 1.28), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.23, 0.85 to 1.78), Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.14, 1.19 to 3.87) and diabetes mellitus (1.16, 1.05 to 1.28). The SMR for leukaemia was 0.77 (0.51 to 1.16). Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality was significantly increased among bus drivers (1.62, 1.37 to 5.04). Lung cancer risk was significantly increased among all workers after 30 years' employment and among maintenance workers. CONCLUSIONS: The study failed to show any increased risk for leukaemias. The increased mortality from Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer may be associated with long-term exposure to urban air pollution.","['Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Stagi, Elena', 'Fontana, Vincenzo', 'Consonni, Dario', 'Gozza, Claudia', 'Garrone, Elsa', 'Bertazzi, Pier Alberto', 'Pesatori, Angela Cecilia']","['Merlo DF', 'Stagi E', 'Fontana V', 'Consonni D', 'Gozza C', 'Garrone E', 'Bertazzi PA', 'Pesatori AC']","['Unit of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Clinical Trials, Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, National Cancer Research Institute, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, Genoa 16132, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Particulate Matter)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Air Pollution/statistics & numerical data', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benzene/analysis/toxicity', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Motor Vehicles/statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Particulate Matter/analysis/toxicity', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/etiology/mortality', 'Urban Health/statistics & numerical data']",2010/06/26 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['oem.2009.050377 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2009.050377 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2010 Sep;67(9):611-9. doi: 10.1136/oem.2009.050377.

However, the molecular mechanisms of this effect and the clinical significance are not fully understood. We applied a microenvironment model to explore the interaction between CLL cells and stromal cells and to elucidate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-K)/Akt/phosphatase and tensin homolog detected on chromosome 10 (PTEN) cascade in this process and its in vivo relevance. Primary human stromal cells from bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen significantly inhibited spontaneous apoptosis of CLL cells. Pan-PI3-K inhibitors (LY294002, wortmannin, PI-103), isotype-specific inhibitors of p110alpha, p110beta, p110gamma, and small interfering RNA against PI3-K and Akt1 counteracted the antiapoptotic effect of the stromal cells. Induction of apoptosis was associated with a decrease in phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, PI3-K-p85, and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), Akt1, and PTEN. Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with CLL (n = 44) showed significantly higher levels of phosphorylated Akt1, PDK-1, PTEN, and CK2 than healthy persons (n = 8). CK2 inhibitors (4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole, apigenin, and 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazol) decreased phosphorylation of PTEN and Akt, induced apoptosis in CLL cells, and enhanced the response to fludarabine. In conclusion, bone marrow microenvironment modulates the PI3-K/Akt/PTEN cascade and prevents apoptosis of CLL cells. Combined inhibition of PI3-K/Akt and recovery of PTEN activity may represent a novel therapeutic concept for CLL.","['Shehata, Medhat', 'Schnabl, Susanne', 'Demirtas, Dita', 'Hilgarth, Martin', 'Hubmann, Rainer', 'Ponath, Elena', 'Badrnya, Sigrun', 'Lehner, Claudia', 'Hoelbl, Andrea', 'Duechler, Markus', 'Gaiger, Alexander', 'Zielinski, Christoph', 'Schwarzmeier, Josef D', 'Jaeger, Ulrich']","['Shehata M', 'Schnabl S', 'Demirtas D', 'Hilgarth M', 'Hubmann R', 'Ponath E', 'Badrnya S', 'Lehner C', 'Hoelbl A', 'Duechler M', 'Gaiger A', 'Zielinski C', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Jaeger U']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. medhat.shehata@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Casein Kinase II/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31301-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-248054 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 7;116(14):2513-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-248054.

AIM: To determine the incidence and risk factors for skeletal morbidity in ALL children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of all (n=186, boys=110) children presenting to a single centre with ALL between 1997 and 2007 and treated on UKALL97, UKALL97/01 or UKALL2003 were studied. Skeletal morbidity included musculoskeletal pain, fractures and osteonecrosis (ON). Musculoskeletal pain was classified as any event of limb pain, muscle pain, joint symptoms or back pain that required radiological examination. Fractures and ON were confirmed by x-rays and MRI, respectively. RESULTS: Skeletal morbidity, presenting as musculoskeletal pain, fractures or ON were reported in 88 (47%) children of whom 56 (63%) were boys. Of 88 children, 49 (55%), 27 (30%) and 18 (20%) had musculoskeletal pain, fracture(s) or ON, respectively. 6 (7%) had fractures and ON. The median (10th, 90th centiles) age at diagnosis of ALL in those children without skeletal morbidity was 3.9 (1.4-12) years which was lower than in those with skeletal morbidity at 8.2 (2.2-14.3) years (p<0.00001, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.4). Children with ALL diagnosed over 8 years of age were at increased risk of developing fracture(s) (p=0.01, OR=2.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.5) whereas the risk of ON was higher in those who were diagnosed after 9 years of age (p<0.0001, OR=15, 95% CI 4.1 to 54.4). There was no sex difference in the incidence of skeletal complications. Children who received Dexamethasone had a higher incidence of skeletal morbidity than those who were treated with Prednisolone (p=0.027, OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.9). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of skeletal morbidity in ALL children may be influenced by age and the type of glucocorticoids.

Many cytokines are crucially important for reproductive processes, and the role of cytokines in the female reproductive system function has been broadly investigated during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for IVF attempts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of serum cytokines and hormones, and the clinical outcomes of women who underwent COS and ICSI procedures. METHODS: The study prospectively included 96 patients (aged 22-43 years, unexplained or male infertility, n = 61; female infertility factors, n = 35) who underwent ICSI cycles. Serum levels of interleukin (IL-8, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-12), tumour necrosis factor and leukaemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) and the hormones FSH, estradiol, progesterone, anti-Mullerian hormone and Inhibin-B were measured on the day of oocyte retrieval. RESULTS: The ongoing pregnancy rate was 25.3%. The presence of serum IL-1beta positively affected the implantation rate (P = 0.004) and increased the chance of becoming pregnant by 15 fold. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with detectable serum IL-1beta levels who conceived (62.5%) was higher than those who failed to conceive (37.5%; P = 0.019). The LIF was undetectable in all serum samples, and no other factors influenced the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing ICSI cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that detectable serum levels of IL-1beta on the day of oocyte retrieval in patients undergoing COS and ICSI are predictive of successful implantation and ongoing pregnancy.","['Bonetti, T C S', 'Salomao, R', 'Brunialti, M', 'Braga, D P A F', 'Borges, E Jr', 'Silva, I D C G']","['Bonetti TC', 'Salomao R', 'Brunialti M', 'Braga DP', 'Borges E Jr', 'Silva ID']","['Molecular Gynecology Laboratory, Departamento de Ginecologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Rua Pedro de Toledo, 781-4 degrees andar Vila Clementino, Sao Paulo, SP 04039-032, Brazil. tbonetti@unifesp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gonadal Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Gonadal Hormones/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/*blood', 'Oocyte Retrieval', '*Ovulation Induction', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Rate']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['deq171 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/deq171 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2010 Aug;25(8):2101-6. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deq171.

Because nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a critical role in these signaling pathways, we investigated the effects of crotepoxide on NF-kappaB-mediated cellular responses in human cancer cells. We found that crotepoxide potentiated tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemotherapeutic agents induced apoptosis and inhibited the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products involved in anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, IAP1,(2) MCl-1, survivin, and TRAF1), apoptosis (Bax, Bid), inflammation (COX-2), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-myc), invasion (ICAM-1 and MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF). We also found that crotepoxide inhibited both inducible and constitutive NF-kappaB activation. Crotepoxide inhibition of NF-kappaB was not inducer-specific; it inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by TNF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke. Crotepoxide suppression of NF-kappaB was not cell type-specific because NF-kappaB activation was inhibited in myeloid, leukemia, and epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that crotepoxide inhibited TAK1 activation, which led to suppression of IkappaBalpha kinase, abrogation of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, nuclear translocation of p65, and suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. Overall, our results indicate that crotepoxide sensitizes tumor cells to cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents through inhibition of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, and this may provide the molecular basis for crotepoxide ability to suppress inflammation and carcinogenesis.","['Prasad, Sahdeo', 'Yadav, Vivek R', 'Sundaram, Chitra', 'Reuter, Simone', 'Hema, Padmanabhan S', 'Nair, Mangalam S', 'Chaturvedi, Madan M', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Prasad S', 'Yadav VR', 'Sundaram C', 'Reuter S', 'Hema PS', 'Nair MS', 'Chaturvedi MM', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Organic Chemistry Section, National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (CSIR), Trivandrum, Kerala 695019, India.', 'Organic Chemistry Section, National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (CSIR), Trivandrum, Kerala 695019, India.', 'Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.', 'Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030.

The aim of this review was to summarize our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of ellipticine action in the cancer cells. The CYP-mediated ellipticine metabolites 9-hydroxy- and 7-hydroxyellipticine and the product of ellipticine oxidation by peroxidases, the ellipticine dimer, are the detoxication metabolites of this compound. In contrast, two carbenium ions, ellipticine-13-ylium and ellipticine-12-ylium, derived from two activation ellipticine metabolites, 13-hydroxyellipticine and 12-hydroxyellipticine, generate two major deoxyguanosine adducts in DNA found in the human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, leukemia HL-60 and CCRF-CEM cells, neuroblastoma IMR-32, UKF-NB-3, and UKF-NB-4 cells and glioblastoma U87MG cells in vitro and in rat breast carcinoma in vivo. Formation of these covalent DNA adducts by ellipticine is the predominant mechanism of its cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity to these cancer cell lines. Ellipticine is also an inducer of CYP1A, 1B1, and 3A4 enzymes in the cancer cells and/or in vivo in rats exposed to this compound, thus modulating its own pharmacological efficiencies. The study forms the basis to further predict the susceptibility of human cancers to ellipticine and suggests that this alkaloid for treatment in combination with CYP and/or peroxidase gene transfer increasing the anticancer potential of this prodrug. It also suggests ellipticine reactive metabolites 13-hydroxyellipticine and 12-hydroxyellipticine to be good candidates for targeting to tumors absent from the CYP and peroxidase activation enzymes.","['Stiborova, M', 'Rupertova, M', 'Frei, E']","['Stiborova M', 'Rupertova M', 'Frei E']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Albertov 2030, 12840 Prague 2, Czech Republic. stiborov@natur.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100608,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Ellipticines/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism']",2010/06/26 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1570-9639(10)00141-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.05.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2011 Jan;1814(1):175-85. doi: 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.05.016.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether there might be excess leukemia-related mortality in populations residing in towns in the vicinity of Spanish metal industries included in the European Pollutant Emission Register. METHODS: Ecologic study designed to examine mortality due to leukemia at a municipal level, during the period 1994-2003. Population exposure to pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source. Using Poisson regression models, we analyzed: risk of dying from leukemia in a 5-kilometer zone around installations which had become operational prior to 1990; effect of pollution discharge route and type of industrial activity; and risk gradient within a 50-kilometer radius of such installations. RESULTS: Excess mortality (relative risk, 95% confidence interval) was detected in the vicinity of pre-1990 installations (1.07, 1.02-1.13 in men; 1.05, 1.00-1.11 in women), with this being more elevated in the case of installations that released pollution to air versus water. On stratifying by type of industrial activity, statistically significant associations were also observed among women residing in the vicinity of galvanizing installations (1.58, 1.09-2.29) and surface-treatment installations using an electrolytic or chemical process (1.34, 1.10-1.62), which released pollution to air. There was an effect whereby risk increased with proximity to certain installations. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest an association between risk of dying due to leukemia and proximity to Spanish metal industries.","['Garcia-Perez, Javier', 'Lopez-Cima, Maria Felicitas', 'Boldo, Elena', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Pablo', 'Aragones, Nuria', 'Pollan, Marina', 'Perez-Gomez, Beatriz', 'Lopez-Abente, Gonzalo']","['Garcia-Perez J', 'Lopez-Cima MF', 'Boldo E', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Aragones N', 'Pollan M', 'Perez-Gomez B', 'Lopez-Abente G']","['Cancer and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Center for Epidemiology, Carlos III Institute of Health, Avda.

However, to realize this bio-medical potential, a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map is required in order to accomplish disease and phenotype association discovery. DESCRIPTION: To remedy this, we generated 3,178,297 paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence reads from seven cats, and combined these data with the publicly available 2X cat whole genome sequence. All sequence reads were assembled together to form a 3X whole genome assembly allowing the discovery of over three million SNPs. To reduce potential false positive SNPs due to the low coverage assembly, a low upper-limit was placed on sequence coverage and a high lower-limit on the quality of the discrepant bases at a potential variant site. In all domestic cats of different breeds: female Abyssinian, female American shorthair, male Cornish Rex, female European Burmese, female Persian, female Siamese, a male Ragdoll and a female African wildcat were sequenced lightly. We report a total of 964 k common SNPs suitable for a domestic cat SNP genotyping array and an additional 900 k SNPs detected between African wildcat and domestic cats breeds. An empirical sampling of 94 discovered SNPs were tested in the sequenced cats resulting in a SNP validation rate of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a large collection of mapped feline SNPs across the cat genome that will allow for the development of SNP genotyping platforms for mapping feline diseases.","['Mullikin, James C', 'Hansen, Nancy F', 'Shen, Lei', 'Ebling, Heather', 'Donahue, William F', 'Tao, Wei', 'Saranga, David J', 'Brand, Adrianne', 'Rubenfield, Marc J', 'Young, Alice C', 'Cruz, Pedro', 'Driscoll, Carlos', 'David, Victor', 'Al-Murrani, Samer W K', 'Locniskar, Mary F', 'Abrahamsen, Mitchell S', ""O'Brien, Stephen J"", 'Smith, Douglas R', 'Brockman, Jeffrey A']","['Mullikin JC', 'Hansen NF', 'Shen L', 'Ebling H', 'Donahue WF', 'Tao W', 'Saranga DJ', 'Brand A', 'Rubenfield MJ', 'Young AC', 'Cruz P', 'Driscoll C', 'David V', 'Al-Murrani SW', 'Locniskar MF', 'Abrahamsen MS', ""O'Brien SJ"", 'Smith DR', 'Brockman JA']","['Genome Technology Branch and NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. mullikin@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100624,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cats/classification/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genome/genetics', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Male', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/09/04 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-11-406 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-11-406 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2010 Jun 24;11:406. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-11-406.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2996934,,,,,['NISC Comparative Sequencing Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABT-737 is a novel inhibitor of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family that has shown promise in various preclinical tumour models. RESULTS: We here report a strong over-additive pro-apoptotic effect of ABT-737 and etoposide, vinblastine or paclitaxel but not 5-fluorouracil in cell lines from human RCC. ABT-737 showed very little activity as a single agent but killed RCC cells potently when anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 or, unexpectedly, A1 was targeted by RNAi. This potent augmentation required endogenous Noxa protein since RNAi directed against Noxa but not against Bim or Puma reduced apoptosis induction by the combination of ABT-737 and etoposide or vinblastine. At the level of mitochondria, etoposide-treatment had a similar sensitizing activity and allowed for ABT-737-induced release of cytochrome c. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapeutic drugs can overcome protection afforded by Mcl-1 and A1 through endogenous Noxa protein in RCC cells, and the combination of such drugs with ABT-737 may be a promising strategy in RCC. Strikingly, A1 emerged in RCC cell lines as a protein of similar importance as the well-established Mcl-1 in protection against apoptosis in these cells.","['Zall, Henry', 'Weber, Arnim', 'Besch, Robert', 'Zantl, Niko', 'Hacker, Georg']","['Zall H', 'Weber A', 'Besch R', 'Zantl N', 'Hacker G']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Trogerstr., Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-164 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-164 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jun 24;9:164. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-164.,,,,PMC2901261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-related gammaretrovirus (XMRV) was identified in prostate tissue with a high prevalence observed in prostate cancer (PC) patients homozygous for the glutamine variant of the RNASEL protein (462Q/Q). Association studies with the R462Q allele and non-XMRV viruses have not been reported. We assessed associations between prostate cancer, prostate viral infections, and the RNASEL 462Q allele in Mexican cancer patients and controls. METHODS: 130 subjects (55 prostate cancer cases and 75 controls) were enrolled in the study. DNA and RNA isolated from prostate tissues were screened for the presence of viral genomes. Genotyping of the RNASEL R462Q variant was performed by Taqman method. RESULTS: R/R, R/Q, and Q/Q frequencies for R462Q were 0.62, 0.38, and 0.0 for PC cases and 0.69, 0.24, and 0.07 for controls, respectively. HPV sequences were detected in 11 (20.0%) cases and 4 (5.3%) controls. XMRV and HCMV infections were detected in one and six control samples, respectively. The risk of PC was significantly increased (Odds Ratio = 3.98; 95% CI: 1.17-13.56, p = 0.027) by infection of the prostatic tissue with HPV. BKV, JCV, and SV40 sequences were not detected in any of the tissue samples examined. CONCLUSIONS: We report a positive association between PC and HPV infection. The 462Q/Q RNASEL genotype was not represented in our PC cases; thus, its interaction with prostate viral infections and cancer could not be evaluated.","['Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L', 'Leach, Robin J', 'Gomez-Guerra, Lauro S', 'Garza-Guajardo, Raquel', 'Johnson-Pais, Teresa', 'Beuten, Joke', 'Morales-Rodriguez, Idelma B', 'Hernandez-Ordonez, Mario A', 'Calderon-Cardenas, German', 'Ortiz-Lopez, Rocio', 'Rivas-Estilla, Ana M', 'Ancer-Rodriguez, Jesus', 'Rojas-Martinez, Augusto']","['Martinez-Fierro ML', 'Leach RJ', 'Gomez-Guerra LS', 'Garza-Guajardo R', 'Johnson-Pais T', 'Beuten J', 'Morales-Rodriguez IB', 'Hernandez-Ordonez MA', 'Calderon-Cardenas G', 'Ortiz-Lopez R', 'Rivas-Estilla AM', 'Ancer-Rodriguez J', 'Rojas-Martinez A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University Hospital Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey 64460, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'BK Virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genotype', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Simian virus 40/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/pathology/virology']",2010/06/26 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2009/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-326 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-326 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Jun 24;10:326. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-326.,,,,PMC2912861,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The catalytic activity of MLL1 is regulated by the formation of a core complex consisting of MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L. The interaction between WDR5 and MLL1 plays an essential role in regulation of the H3K4 methyltransferase activity of MLL1 and targeting this interaction using small molecules may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy. In this study, we have defined the essential elements in MLL1 required for its high-affinity binding to WDR5. Our data showed that the minimal elements crucial for high-affinity binding of MLL1 to WDR5 are -CO-ARA-NH- motif and two intramolecular hydrogen bonds that stabilize the conformation of this motif. Two 3-mer peptides, Ac-ARA-NH(2) and Ac-ART-NH(2), were designed based upon MLL1 and H3 sequences and achieved K(i) values of 120 and 20 nM to WDR5, respectively. Our study provides a concrete basis for the design of potent peptidomimetics and nonpeptidic compounds to inhibit MLL1 activity by targeting the MLL1 and WDR5 interaction.","['Karatas, Hacer', 'Townsend, Elizabeth C', 'Bernard, Denzil', 'Dou, Yali', 'Wang, Shaomeng']","['Karatas H', 'Townsend EC', 'Bernard D', 'Dou Y', 'Wang S']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Oligopeptides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation']",2010/06/26 06:00,2010/08/26 06:00,['2010/06/26 06:00'],"['2010/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm100139b [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2010 Jul 22;53(14):5179-85. doi: 10.1021/jm100139b.,,,['R01 GM082856/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4289617,,,,['NIHMS651061'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody, represents a well tolerated treatment option, but optimal treatment schedules are still unknown. Additionally, Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) inhibits the CD33-induced block on cytokine-induced proliferation. Consequently, a variable response of AML cells to anti-CD33-targeted therapy may be caused by modulation of SOCS3 expression. Twenty-four patients with refractory or relapsed CD33-positive AML received GO as a single agent before or after conventional chemotherapy. The methylation status of the SOCS3 CpG island was assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Response (RR) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in 16 patients receiving chemotherapy before GO (RR 81%, OS 14.8 months) compared to three patients who received GO single agent therapy (RR 33%, OS 7.2 months) or 16 with GO before chemotherapy (RR 0% OS 2.2 months, P = 0.01 for RR and P < 0.001 for OS). Methylation of the SOCS3 CpG island was found in 8/24 patients. There was a trend towards a higher RR and longer OS in patients with SOCS3 hypermethylation (RR 86%, OS 25.1 months) compared to unmethylated SOCS3 (RR 56%, OS 10.3 months, P = 0.09). Administration of GO a few days after chemotherapy seems to provide better response and survival compared to administration of GO directly before chemotherapy. The potential role of SOCS3 hypermethylation as a biomarker should be further investigated in patients undergoing GO containing therapies.","['Middeldorf, Iris', 'Galm, Oliver', 'Osieka, Rainhardt', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Herman, James G', 'Wilop, Stefan']","['Middeldorf I', 'Galm O', 'Osieka R', 'Jost E', 'Herman JG', 'Wilop S']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21723 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Jul;85(7):477-81. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21723.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, BCR-ABL induces genomic instability that can contribute to the emergence of resistant clones to the ABL kinase inhibitors. It is currently unknown whether the inherited individual capability to repair DNA damage could affect the treatment results. To address this, a comprehensive analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes (ERCC2-ERCC8, RPA1-RPA3, LIG1, RAD23B, XPA, XPC) was performed in 92 chronic phase CML patients treated with imatinib upfront. ERCC5 and XPC SNPs correlated with the response to imatinib. Haplotype analysis of XPC showed that the wild-type haplotype (499C-939A) was associated with a better response to imatinib. Moreover, the 5-year failure free survival for CA carriers was significantly better than that of the non-CA carriers (98% vs. 73%; P = 0.02). In the multivariate logistic model with genetic data and clinical covariates, the hemoglobin (Hb) level and the XPC haplotype were independently associated with the treatment response, with patients having a Hb < or =11 g/dl (Odds ratio [OR] = 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-16.1) or a non-CA XPC haplotype (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.6-10.6) being at higher risk of suboptimal response/treatment failure.

The aim of this study was to identify genes that differentiate between patients with disease stage A vs. C according to Binet in order to better understand the disease. To achieve this, we performed DNA microarray analysis on B cells from CLL patients with stage A and C according to Binet and matched controls. Between CLL patients and controls, there were 1,528 differentially expressed genes and 360 genes were differentially expressed between Binet A and C patients. Due to the sheer number of regulated genes, we focused on the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR). AMFR has not previously been investigated in hematological disorders, but high expression of AMFR correlates with a more advanced stage and invasive potential in several human tumors. AMFR mRNA expression was higher in Binet A compared with Binet C patients (P=0.0053) and healthy controls (P=0.0051). Total AMFR protein was higher in Binet A patients compared to Binet C as analyzed by intracellular flow cytometry. However, AMFR exist both in the ER involved in protein degradation and on the cell surface involved in metastasis and cell motility. Cell surface AMFR was increased in Binet C compared with Binet A+B (P=0.016). In conclusion, the mRNA levels reflect the total amount of AMFR, whereas cell surface expression is associated with progression in CLL.","['Grund, Sofia', 'Olsson, Bob', 'Jernas, Margareta', 'Jacobsson, Stefan', 'Swolin, Birgitta', 'Nabi, Ivan R', 'Carlsson, Lena', 'Wadenvik, Hans']","['Grund S', 'Olsson B', 'Jernas M', 'Jacobsson S', 'Swolin B', 'Nabi IR', 'Carlsson L', 'Wadenvik H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology and Coagulation, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg, 413 45, Gothenburg, Sweden. sofia.grund@medic.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (AMFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Receptors, Autocrine Motility Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Separation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Autocrine Motility Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2010/06/25 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9555-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Dec;28(4):1542-8. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9555-7.

However, recent evidence suggests that doses of ionizing radiation (IR) delivered inside the tumor target volume, during fractionated radiotherapy, can promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, the tissues that surround the tumor area are also exposed to low doses of IR that are lower than those delivered inside the tumor mass, because external radiotherapy is delivered to the tumor through multiple radiation beams, in order to prevent damage of organs at risk. The biological effects of these low doses of IR on the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor area, and in particular on the vasculature remain largely to be determined. We found that doses of IR lower or equal to 0.8 Gy enhance endothelial cell migration without impinging on cell proliferation or survival. Moreover, we show that low-dose IR induces a rapid phosphorylation of several endothelial cell proteins, including the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor-2 and induces VEGF production in hypoxia mimicking conditions. By activating the VEGF Receptor-2, low-dose IR enhances endothelial cell migration and prevents endothelial cell death promoted by an anti-angiogenic drug, bevacizumab. In addition, we observed that low-dose IR accelerates embryonic angiogenic sprouting during zebrafish development and promotes adult angiogenesis during zebrafish fin regeneration and in the murine Matrigel assay. Using murine experimental models of leukemia and orthotopic breast cancer, we show that low-dose IR promotes tumor growth and metastasis and that these effects were prevented by the administration of a VEGF receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor immediately before IR exposure. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism to the understanding of the potential pro-metastatic effect of IR and may provide a new rationale basis to the improvement of current radiotherapy protocols.","['Sofia Vala, Ines', 'Martins, Leila R', 'Imaizumi, Natsuko', 'Nunes, Raquel J', 'Rino, Jose', 'Kuonen, Francois', 'Carvalho, Lara M', 'Ruegg, Curzio', 'Grillo, Isabel Monteiro', 'Barata, Joao Taborda', 'Mareel, Marc', 'Santos, Susana Constantino Rosa']","['Sofia Vala I', 'Martins LR', 'Imaizumi N', 'Nunes RJ', 'Rino J', 'Kuonen F', 'Carvalho LM', 'Ruegg C', 'Grillo IM', 'Barata JT', 'Mareel M', 'Santos SC']","['Angiogenesis Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100621,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bevacizumab', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/radiation effects', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endothelial Cells/pathology/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Microvessels/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/*blood supply/genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Regeneration/radiation effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism', 'Zebrafish/embryology/physiology']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0011222 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Jun 21;5(6):e11222. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011222.,,,,PMC2888592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several members of this protein family have been associated with human cancers; however, there is little evidence for a direct link between deregulated de-ubiquitination and neoplastic transformation. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH)-L1 is a DUB of unknown function that is overexpressed in several human cancers, but whether it has oncogenic properties has not been established. To address this issue, we generated mice that overexpress UCH-L1 under the control of a ubiquitous promoter. Here, we show that UCH-L1 transgenic mice are prone to malignancy, primarily lymphomas and lung tumors. Furthermore, UCH-L1 overexpression strongly accelerated lymphomagenesis in Emu-myc transgenic mice. Aberrantly expressed UCH-L1 boosts signaling through the Akt pathway by downregulating the antagonistic phosphatase PHLPP1, an event that requires its de-ubiquitinase activity. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for DUB-driven oncogenesis and suggest that UCH-L1 hyperactivity deregulates normal Akt signaling.","['Hussain, S', 'Foreman, O', 'Perkins, S L', 'Witzig, T E', 'Miles, R R', 'van Deursen, J', 'Galardy, P J']","['Hussain S', 'Foreman O', 'Perkins SL', 'Witzig TE', 'Miles RR', 'van Deursen J', 'Galardy PJ']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55906, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (UCHL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', '*Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010138 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.138 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1641-55. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.138.

Tissue damage as a result of chemoradiation injury is the initiating event in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. Variations in DNA repair can influence the amount of tissue damage in response to alkylating agents and ionizing radiation used as conditioning during HCT. As DNA damage caused by these agents is repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, we hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BER pathway will be associated with GVHD after HCT. Hence, we analyzed 179 SNPs in BER pathway in 470 recipients of allogeneic HCT for association with acute and chronic GVHD. In multivariate analysis, one SNP (rs6844176) in RFC1 (replication factor C (activator 1)) gene was independently associated with a higher risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (relative risk (RR): 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.70, P=0.001), and showed a trend toward higher risk of grade III-IV acute GVHD (RR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.95-1.85, P=0.09). One SNP in PARP1 gene (rs1805410) was associated with a higher risk of chronic GVHD (RR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.29-2.54, P=0.001). These results show that SNPs in the BER pathway can be used as genetic biomarkers to predict those at high risk for GVHD toward whom novel prophylactic strategies could be targeted.","['Arora, M', 'Lindgren, B', 'Basu, S', 'Nagaraj, S', 'Gross, M', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Thyagarajan, B']","['Arora M', 'Lindgren B', 'Basu S', 'Nagaraj S', 'Gross M', 'Weisdorf D', 'Thyagarajan B']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. arora005@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010139 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1470-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.139.

XLA is characterized by a B-cell differentiation arrest in bone marrow, absence of mature B cells and immunoglobulins (Igs), and recurrent bacterial infections. We used self-inactivating lentiviral vectors expressing codon-optimized human BTK under the control of three different ubiquitous or B cell-specific promoters. Btk-/- mice engrafted with transduced cells showed correction of both precursor B-cell and peripheral B-cell development. Lentiviral vectors containing the wildtype BTK sequence did not correct the phenotype. All treated mice with codon-optimized BTK exhibited the recovery of B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity, and of serum IgM and IgG3 levels. Calcium mobilization responses upon B-cell receptor stimulation as well as in vivo responses to T cell-independent antigens were restored. Viral promoters overexpressing BTK >100-fold above normal resulted in erythro-myeloid proliferations independent of insertional mutagenesis. However, transplantation into secondary Btk-/- recipients using cellular promoters resulted in functional restoration of peripheral B cells and IgM levels, without any adverse effects. In conclusion, transduction of human BTK corrects B-cell development and antigen-specific antibody responses in Btk-/- mice, thus indicating the feasibility of lentiviral gene therapy for XLA, provided that BTK expression does not vastly exceed normal levels.","['Ng, Y Y', 'Baert, M R M', 'Pike-Overzet, K', 'Rodijk, M', 'Brugman, M H', 'Schambach, A', 'Baum, C', 'Hendriks, R W', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Staal, F J T']","['Ng YY', 'Baert MR', 'Pike-Overzet K', 'Rodijk M', 'Brugman MH', 'Schambach A', 'Baum C', 'Hendriks RW', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Staal FJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Codon', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010140 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1617-30. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.140.

Disruption of HOX protein function using the peptide HXR9 has shown anti-tumor effects against melanoma, lung cancer and renal cancer. In this report, we evaluated the expression of all 39 HOX genes in a panel of six malignant B-cell lines, including multiple myeloma cells and found different levels of expression of HOX family members suggesting that they also have a role in malignant B-cell survival. We show that disrupting HOX function using the peptide HXR9 induces significant cytotoxicity in the entire panel of cell lines. Importantly, we found that the cytotoxic effects of HXR9 can be enhanced by combining it with ch128.1Av, an antibody-avidin fusion protein specific for the human transferrin receptor 1 (CD71). Iron starvation induced by the fusion protein contributes to the enhanced effect and involves, at least in part, the induction of a caspase-independent pathway. These results show the relevance of HOX proteins in malignant B-cell survival and suggest that our therapeutic strategy may be effective in the treatment of incurable B-cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma.","['Daniels, T R', 'Neacato, I I', 'Rodriguez, J A', 'Pandha, H S', 'Morgan, R', 'Penichet, M L']","['Daniels TR', 'Neacato II', 'Rodriguez JA', 'Pandha HS', 'Morgan R', 'Penichet ML']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1782, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Cell Death/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010142 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Sep;24(9):1555-65. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.142.

Here we have investigated a role of autophagy, a protein degradation pathway that involves proteolysis of intracellular material within lysosomes. We found that both all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide induce autophagy via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in APL cells and that autophagic degradation contributes significantly both to the basal turnover as well as the therapy-induced proteolysis of PML/RARA. In addition, we observed a correlation between autophagy and therapy-induced differentiation of APL cells.

We recently identified several features of CML CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells expected to confer resistance to BCR-ABL-targeted therapeutics. From a study of 25 initially chronic-phase patients, we now demonstrate that some, but not all, of these parameters correlate with subsequent clinical response to IM therapy. CD34(+) cells from the 14 IM nonresponders demonstrated greater resistance to IM than the 11 IM responders in colony-forming cell assays in vitro (P < .001) and direct sequencing of cloned transcripts from CD34(+) cells further revealed a higher incidence of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in the IM nonresponders (10%-40% vs 0%-20% in IM responders, P < .003). In contrast, CD34(+) cells from IM nonresponders and IM responders were not distinguished by differences in BCR-ABL or transporter gene expression. Interestingly, one BCR-ABL mutation (V304D), predicted to destabilize the interaction between p210(BCR-ABL) and IM, was detectable in 14 of 20 patients.

HTLV-1-transformed cells share phenotypic properties with memory and regulatory T cells (T-reg). Murine T-reg-mediated suppression employs elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels as a key regulator. This led us to determine cAMP levels in HTLV-1-transformed cells. We found elevated cAMP concentrations as a consistent feature of all HTLV-1-transformed cell lines, including in vitro-HTLV-1-transformed, Tax-transformed, and patient-derived cells. In transformed cells with conditional Tax expression, high cAMP levels coincided with the presence of Tax but were lost without it. However, transient ectopic expression of Tax alone was not sufficient to induce cAMP. We found specific downregulation of the cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) in HTLV-1-transformed cells, which was independent of Tax in transient expression experiments. This is in line with the notion that PDE3B transcripts and cAMP levels are inversely correlated. Overexpression of PDE3B led to a decrease of cAMP in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Decreased expression of PDE3B was associated with inhibitory histone modifications at the PDE3B promoter and the PDE3B locus. In summary, Tax transformation and its continuous expression contribute to elevated cAMP levels, which may be regulated through PDE3B suppression. This shows that HTLV-1-transformed cells assume biological features of long-lived T-cell populations that potentially contribute to viral persistence.","['Kress, Andrea K', 'Schneider, Grit', 'Pichler, Klemens', 'Kalmer, Martina', 'Fleckenstein, Bernhard', 'Grassmann, Ralph']","['Kress AK', 'Schneider G', 'Pichler K', 'Kalmer M', 'Fleckenstein B', 'Grassmann R']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. andrea.kress@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100623,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE3B protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00487-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00487-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Sep;84(17):8732-42. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00487-10.

Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), also known as interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), is a transcription factor expressed predominantly in myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages. To find the functional direct target genes of IRF8, the gene expression profiles of siRNA knockdown samples and genome-wide binding locations by ChIP-chip were analyzed in THP-1 myelomonocytic leukemia cells. Consequently, 84 genes were identified as functional direct targets. The ETS family transcription factor PU.1, also known as SPI1, binds to IRF8 and regulates basal transcription in macrophages. Using the same approach, we identified 53 direct target genes of PU.1; these overlapped with 19 IRF8 targets. These 19 genes included key molecules of IFN signaling such as OAS1 and IRF9, but excluded other IFN-related genes amongst the IRF8 functional direct target genes. We suggest that IRF8 and PU.1 can have both combined, and independent actions on different promoters in myeloid cells.","['Kubosaki, Atsutaka', 'Lindgren, Gabriella', 'Tagami, Michihira', 'Simon, Christophe', 'Tomaru, Yasuhiro', 'Miura, Hisashi', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Arner, Erik', 'Forrest, Alistair R R', 'Irvine, Katharine M', 'Schroder, Kate', 'Hasegawa, Yuki', 'Kanamori-Katayama, Mutsumi', 'Rehli, Michael', 'Hume, David A', 'Kawai, Jun', 'Suzuki, Masanori', 'Suzuki, Harukazu', 'Hayashizaki, Yoshihide']","['Kubosaki A', 'Lindgren G', 'Tagami M', 'Simon C', 'Tomaru Y', 'Miura H', 'Suzuki T', 'Arner E', 'Forrest AR', 'Irvine KM', 'Schroder K', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Kanamori-Katayama M', 'Rehli M', 'Hume DA', 'Kawai J', 'Suzuki M', 'Suzuki H', 'Hayashizaki Y']","['RIKEN Omics Science Center, RIKEN Yokohama Institute, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/08/31 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(10)00448-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2010.05.289 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2010 Aug;47(14):2295-302. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2010.05.289.

However, few reports demonstrate consistent, prevalent and dense promoter methylation, associated with tumour-specific gene silencing. By screening candidate genes, we have detected frequent and dense methylation of the TESTIN (TES) promoter. RESULTS: Bisulfite sequencing showed that 100% of the ALL samples (n = 20) were methylated at the TES promoter, whereas the matched remission (n = 5), normal bone marrow (n = 6) and normal PBL (n = 5) samples were unmethylated. Expression of TES in hyperdiploid, TEL-AML+, BCR-ABL+, and E2A-PBX+ subtypes of B lineage ALL was markedly reduced compared to that in normal bone marrow progenitor cells and in B cells. In addition TES methylation and silencing was demonstrated in nine out of ten independent B ALL propagated as xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. CONCLUSION: In total, 93% of B ALL samples (93 of 100) demonstrated methylation with silencing or reduced expression of the TES gene. Thus, TES is the most frequently methylated and silenced gene yet reported in ALL. TES, a LIM domain-containing tumour suppressor gene and component of the focal adhesion complex, is involved in adhesion, motility, cell-to-cell interactions and cell signalling. Our data implicate TES methylation in ALL and provide additional evidence for the involvement of LIM domain proteins in leukaemogenesis.","['Weeks, Robert J', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Song, Sarah', 'Morison, Ian M']","['Weeks RJ', 'Kees UR', 'Song S', 'Morison IM']","['Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand. rob.weeks@otago.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TES protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-163 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-163 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jun 24;9:163. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-163.,,,,PMC3224738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Response to initial therapy is an important prognosticator of outcome based on disease biology, as well as pharmacogenetics, which include the patient's response to drugs given. The more widespread availability of allogeneic transplantation and reduced-intensity regimens for older patients have opened up this curative modality to a greater number of patients. Hopefully, those options, as well as novel cytogenetic and molecular markers, will enable a better selection of patients who undergo intensive therapies and finally break the 30-40% cure barrier for adults with ALL.","['Rowe, Jacob M']",['Rowe JM'],"['Rambam Health Care Campus and Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100622,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/25 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8246 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08246.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Aug;150(4):389-405. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08246.x.

The aim of this study was to examine this association. METHODS: We surveyed the association with benign and malignant neoplasms in Down syndrome patients registered in the Annual of Pathological Autopsy Cases of Japan (1974-2000), a database of autopsied cases operated by the Japanese Society of Pathology. RESULTS: In a total of 1514 cases with Down syndrome, there were eight cases with 10 benign tumors (four male and four female) and 104 cases with malignant disorders (61 male, 42 female and one case with unrecorded sex), in which 87 cases with hematopoietic malignancies (83.7%) and 17 cases with solid tumors (16.3%), were identified. The association of gallbladder adenocarcinoma with a benign tumor of the colon was noted in one case, while a further two cases with double benign tumors were confirmed as well. No case with a double malignancy was found. Hematopoietic malignancies (87 cases) included 31 cases (35.6%) with acute myelocytic leukemia, 10 (11.4%) with acute lymphocytic leukemia and two (2.3%) with chronic myelocytic leukemia. The ratio of acute myelocytic leukemia to acute lymphocytic leukemia was 3.1 in the present study. A peak in the age distribution was at 0 years in our data in contrast to the previous data (at 1 year) for myelocytic leukemia. The 17 solid tumors identified included three hepatocellular carcinomas, three extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, two gallbladder adenocarcinomas, three brain tumors, and three seminomas. CONCLUSION: We present new associations of benign and malignant tumors with Down syndrome.","['Ehara, Hiroaki', 'Ohno, Kousaku', 'Ito, Hisao']","['Ehara H', 'Ohno K', 'Ito H']","['Department of Special Education, Faculty of Education, Shiga University, Otsu, Shiga, Japan. ehara@edu.shiga-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/25 06:00,2012/01/26 06:00,['2010/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['PED3189 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1442-200X.2010.03189.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2011 Feb;53(1):72-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2010.03189.x.,,,,,['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) may add important diagnostic information. METHODS: To evaluate the potential role of MFC in the diagnostic setting of MDS, the authors analyzed the results from 1013 patients with suspected MDS by using CM, CG, and MFC in parallel. RESULTS: Concordance between CM and MFC was 82% for diagnostic results in 788 patients who had unequivocal CM results. An additional 225 patients had only minor dysplastic features identified by CM, including 51 patients (22.7%) who had clear evidence of MDS by MFC. Twelve patients who had no indication of MDS identified by CM had MDS-typical CG aberrations; in 6 of those patients (50%), MFC revealed MDS characteristics. In another 11 of 23 patients (47.8%) who had minor dysplastic features identified by CM and MDS-typical CG aberrations, MFC revealed MDS characteristics. The percentages of blasts determined by CM and by MFC were strongly correlated (P<.001). The frequency of aberrantly expressed antigens differed significantly between patients rated by CM as MDS (highest frequencies), suspected MDS, and no MDS (lowest frequencies). In various patients, MFC identified MDS-typical aberrant antigen expression in cell compartments that were not rated dysplastic by CM. The numbers of aberrantly expressed antigens were correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System scores and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis clearly demonstrated an increased diagnostic yield with MFC when added to CM and CG in patients with suspected MDS.","['Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kern W', 'Haferlach C', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. wolfgang.kern@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25353 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Oct 1;116(19):4549-63. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25353.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data on the efficacy and safety of nilotinib treatment were collected from 2 phase 2 expanded access clinical trials with similar designs (CAMN107AIL01 and ENACT). RESULTS: Of 88 study patients (58 chronic, 11 accelerated, 19 blast crisis), the best responses to nilotinib were complete hematologic response (CHR) in 27%, partial cytogenetic response in 12%, complete cytogenetic response in 14%, and major molecular response in 19%. Patients achieving at least a CHR during imatinib therapy were more likely to respond to nilotinib, and failure to achieve at least a CHR on imatinib therapy was predictive of progression or lack of response to nilotinib (P=.0021). Responses were not statistically different in subgroup analysis, including that of imatinib intolerance compared with imatinib resistance, presence of ABL kinase domain mutations compared with absence of mutations, and previous treatment with another second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor compared no prior treatment. The overall survival and progression-free survival rates at 1 year were 83% and 48% for the entire cohort, 93% and 66% in chronic phase, and 64% and 19% in advanced phase. Adverse hematological events included thrombocytopenia (all events, 27%; grade 3-4, 13%) and leukopenia (all events, 18%; grade 3-4, 10%). The majority of the nonhematological events were mild, the most common being rash, infection, bone pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib treatment is an efficient and safe therapy for imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients. Prior response to imatinib therapy is a predictor for the response to nilotinib.","['Koren-Michowitz, Maya', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Panayiotidis, Panayiotis', 'Prejzner, Witold', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Koren-Michowitz M', 'le Coutre P', 'Duyster J', 'Scheid C', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Prejzner W', 'Rowe JM', 'Schwarz M', 'Goldschmidt N', 'Nagler A']","['Division of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel. m.koren.michowitz@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25351 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Oct 1;116(19):4564-72. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25351.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer. 2011 Jan 1;117(1):230'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ninety-seven children with ALL received risk-directed therapy based on presenting clinical and biological factors. During consolidation therapy, low-risk patients received half the dose of intravenous methotrexate that standard-risk/high-risk patients received, and fewer doses of triple intrathecal therapy. Patients were classified according to end of consolidation magnetic resonance imaging scans (normal or leukoencephalopathy), and continuous measures of white matter structure were computed. As part of the protocol study, children completed cognitive assessment 2 years later (completion of therapy), using Digit Span Forward (DSF) for attention and Digit Span Backward (DSB) for WM. RESULTS: For the total sample and the standard-/high-risk group, Total Digit Span (TDS), DSF, and DSB were impaired relative to norms (P<.05). In the low-risk group, only DSB was impaired (P<.0001). Across groups, a higher percentage of patients performed below the average range (scale score<7) on DSB (66%) compared with the DSF (14%) or TDS (18%). Regression analysis indicated that DSB predicted estimated IQ (P<.05), after accounting for DSF. Leukoencephalopathy was predictive of lower TDS (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: WM appears to be especially sensitive to treatment-related changes in ALL survivors, detecting difficulties potentially missed by global intelligence measures. These findings may facilitate the identification of vulnerable neural pathways and the development of targeted cognitive interventions.","['Ashford, Jason', 'Schoffstall, Corrie', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Leone, Christina', 'Laningham, Fred H', 'Glass, John O', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Conklin, Heather M']","['Ashford J', 'Schoffstall C', 'Reddick WE', 'Leone C', 'Laningham FH', 'Glass JO', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Pui CH', 'Conklin HM']","[""Department of Behavioral Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. jason.ashford@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Attention', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Leukoencephalopathies/diagnosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Memory, Short-Term', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*psychology', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25343 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Oct 1;116(19):4638-45. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25343.,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA90246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2946517,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS212777'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study was conducted to evaluate whether addition of anthracycline-based consolidation chemotherapy (Course 2) with liposomal daunorubicin (150 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on Days 1 and 2) and cytarabine (1.5 g/m2 IV on Days 1 and 2) to the standard hyper-CVAD regimen (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine) would improve outcome. METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive adults with de novo ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma were treated with this modified hyper-CVAD regimen inclusive of rituximab for CD20 expression>/=20%. RESULTS: Sixty-three (93%) patients achieved complete response (CR). With a median follow-up of 90 months, the 5-year CR duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 46% and 44%, respectively. Compared with 208 patients treated with standard hyper-CVAD (rates of 45% and 47%, respectively; P=not significant), outcome with the modified hyper-CVAD regimen was not improved overall. Outcome was improved by the addition of rituximab for the CD20-positive subset (rates of CRD and OS of 50% and 53%, respectively), whereas anthracycline intensification worsened outcome for the CD20-negative subset (rates of CRD and OS of 41% and 35%, respectively; P=.01) compared with standard hyper-CVAD. A high mortality rate related to infections in CR was noted among patients aged 60 years or older.

Technical approaches and clinical implementation.,81-90,10.1007/s12253-010-9286-2 [doi],"UNLABELLED: A nationwide study was started in 1993 to provide genetic diagnosis for all newly diagnosed childhood ALL cases in Hungary using cytogenetic examination, DNA-index determination, FISH (aneuploidy, ABL/BCR, TEL/AML1) and molecular genetic tests (ABL/BCR, MLL/AF4, TEL/AML1). Aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of different genetic methods, to study the frequency of various aberrations and their prognostic significance. Results were synthesized for genetic subgrouping of patients. To assess the prognostic value of genetic aberrations overall and event-free survival of genetic subgroups were compared using Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic role of aberrations was investigated by multivariate analysis (Cox's regression) as well in comparison with other factors (age, sex, major congenital abnormalities, initial WBC, therapy, immunophenotype). Five hundred eighty-eight ALL cases were diagnosed between 1993-2002. Cytogenetic examination was performed in 537 (91%) (success rate 73%), DNA-index in 265 (45%), FISH in 74 (13%), TEL/AML1 RT-PCR in 219 (37%) cases producing genetic diagnosis in 457 patients (78%). Proportion of subgroups with good prognosis in prae-B-cell ALL was lower than expected: hyperdiploidB 18% (73/400), TEL/AML1+ 9% (36/400). Univariate analysis showed significantly better 5-year EFS in TEL/AML1+ (82%) and hyperdiploidB cases (78%) than in tetraploid (44%) or pseudodiploid (52%) subgroups. By multivariate analysis main negative prognostic factors were: congenital abnormalities, high WBC, delay in therapy, specific translocations. CONCLUSION: Complementary use of each of genetic methods used is necessary for reliable genetic diagnosis according to the algorithm presented. Specific genetic alterations proved to be of prognostic significance.","['Olah, Eva', 'Balogh, Erzsebet', 'Pajor, Laszlo', 'Jakab, Zsuzsanna']","['Olah E', 'Balogh E', 'Pajor L', 'Jakab Z']","['Clinical Genetic Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Debrecen, 98 Nagyerdei krt, 4012 Debrecen, Hungary. eolah@dote.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100624,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/standards', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Testing/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Hungary', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2010/06/24 06:00,2011/06/18 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2009/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-010-9286-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2011 Mar;17(1):81-90. doi: 10.1007/s12253-010-9286-2.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients from the National Cancer Institute (Cairo University) diagnosed with different types of cancer at time interval of one year were included in the study pool. Twenty patients were known to have lung cancer, 15 patients with breast cancer, 10 patients with lymphoma and 15 patients with leukemia. No age or sex predilection. All patients performed cranial MRI before and after intravenous contrast media injection, backed by the clinical assumption of encephalopathy and wide spectrum of neurological symptoms as seizures, dementia and behavioral disorders. Some of the patients with positive MRI studies performed serological test to detect onconeuronal antibodies. The study was carried out from January till December 2007. RESULTS: Thirty three patients' revealed definite MRI signal abnormality involving the limbic system proper and further temporal lobes affection while five patients revealed mixed pattern of regional encephalitic changes including the cerebellum, frontal lobes and brain stem. The rest of the study group exhibited no signs of encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Specific MRI appearance could be traced in paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis thus establishing diagnostic pattern for such entity that could help characterizing the disease with subsequent impact upon the treatment protocol resulting in regaining normal brain faculties and better life quality for such cancer patients.

The MTX concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was evaluated in 138 samples from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture 12-24 hours after starting the HD MTX infusion (5 g/m2 over 24 hours) and immediately before the IT administration of MTX. Serum MTX concentrations at the end of infusion were assessed by routine therapeutic drug monitoring. Cytotoxic MTX concentrations of 1 microM or greater were detected in 81.2% of CSF samples. CSF MTX concentrations were significantly lower in samples from patients younger than 7 years. The correlation between MTX concentrations in the serum and the CSF was moderate (r = 0.451) and became stronger with increasing age. The median CSF MTX concentrations per cycle were comparable (1.40, 1.25, 1.39, 1.38 microM for cycles 1-4, respectively). The predictive value and the accuracy of the CSF MTX concentration measured during the first cycle of HD MTX in respect to concentrations in the following cycles were high (94.4% and 85.7%, respectively) suggesting that the CSF MTX concentration during the first HD MTX infusion is a useful predictor for sufficient CSF MTX concentrations in the following HD MTX cycles. Our results confirm previously published data on MTX accumulation in the CSF after 5 g/m2 MTX over 24 hours in an independent cohort monitored in a real-life setting. Based on the common opinion that 1 microM represents the minimal antileukemic MTX concentration, current data warrant reevaluation of the necessity of routine IT MTX following HD MTX. Our findings offer a perspective on reducing the burden of IT MTX in children on consolidation therapy by CSF MTX drug monitoring.","['Niemann, Andreas', 'Muhlisch, Jorg', 'Fruhwald, Michael C', 'Gerss, Joachim', 'Hempel, Georg', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Niemann A', 'Muhlisch J', 'Fruhwald MC', 'Gerss J', 'Hempel G', 'Boos J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aging/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Biotransformation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181e5c6b3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2010 Aug;32(4):467-75. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181e5c6b3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1) is a transcriptional repressor with essential roles in controlling hematopoietic stem cell biology, myeloid and lymphoid differentiation and lymphocyte effector functions. Recent work has suggested that Gfi1 competes or collaborates with other transcription factors to modulate transcription programs and lineage decisions. SUMMARY: Gfi1 is central to several transcriptional circuits whose dysregulation leads to abnormal or malignant hematopoiesis. These functional relationships are conserved from Drosophila development. Such conserved pathways represent central oncogenic or 'gatekeeper' pathways that are pivotal to understanding the process of cellular transformation, and illustrate key targets for clinical intervention.","['Phelan, James D', 'Shroyer, Noah F', 'Cook, Tiffany', 'Gebelein, Brian', 'Grimes, H Leighton']","['Phelan JD', 'Shroyer NF', 'Cook T', 'Gebelein B', 'Grimes HL']","[""Immunobiology Graduate Program, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/physiopathology', 'Neutropenia/genetics/physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32833a06f8 [doi]', '00062752-201007000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Jul;17(4):300-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32833a06f8.,,,"['R01 HL079574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA142601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA117846/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DK084167/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL079574/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079574-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079574-06S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142826-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DK084167-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA142601-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2910316,,,79,['NIHMS220519'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predictions are subsequently made using an appropriate statistical summary of each gene cluster, which we call the `meta-covariate' representation of the cluster, in a probit regression model. We first illustrate this method by analysing a leukaemia expression dataset, before focusing closely on the meta-covariate analysis of a renal gene expression dataset in a rat model of salt-sensitive hypertension. We explore the biological insights provided by our analysis of these data. In particular, we identify a highly influential cluster of 13 genes--including three transcription factors (Arntl, Bhlhe41 and Npas2)-that is implicated as being protective against hypertension in response to increased dietary sodium. Functional and canonical pathway analysis of this cluster using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis implicated transcriptional activation and circadian rhythm signalling, respectively. Although we illustrate our method using only expression data, the method is applicable to any high-dimensional datasets.

Understanding how to identify patients who may be most sensitive to treatment is clearly needed to improve the development of these molecules. We studied four multiple myeloma cell lines treated with the KSP inhibitor ARRY-520 to identify factors important for initiating apoptosis while cells are arrested in mitosis. The majority (three of four) of cell lines underwent mitotic arrest, with apoptosis occurring in mitosis within 24 to 30 hours. The remaining line (NCI H929) is temporally refractory to ARRY-520 treatment, undergoing mitotic slippage and subsequently peaking in apoptotic markers after 72 hours of treatment, while most cells are in interphase. Interestingly, loss of the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) coincided with mitotic cell death. Stabilization of Mcl-1 resulted in a delayed onset of apoptosis, whereas enforced downregulation of Mcl-1 increased cell death in response to KSP inhibition. Thus, variation in responses to KSP inhibition is governed by a balance between survival proteins and spindle checkpoint integrity. Cells relying on short-lived survival proteins during mitosis are more likely to undergo apoptosis in response to KSP inhibition. We propose that patients with hematologic malignancies, which rely on Mcl-1, would therefore be good candidates for treatment with KSP inhibitors.","['Tunquist, Brian J', 'Woessner, Richard D', 'Walker, Duncan H']","['Tunquist BJ', 'Woessner RD', 'Walker DH']","['Translational Oncology, Array BioPharma, Inc., Boulder, Colorado 80301, USA.

Multiple genetic and molecular defects, including an activating mutation in the BRaf kinase gene, are associated with melanoma, and the resulting alterations in signal transduction pathways regulating proliferation and apoptosis are thought to contribute to its chemoresistance. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets BRaf kinase, is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas. Although sorafenib has shown little promise as a single agent in melanoma patients, recent clinical trials suggest that, when combined with chemotherapy, it may have more benefit. We evaluated the ability of sorafenib to augment the cytotoxic effects of melphalan, a regional chemotherapeutic agent, and temozolomide, used in systemic and regional treatment of melanoma, on a panel of 24 human melanoma-derived cell lines and in an animal model of melanoma. Marked differences in response to 10 micromol/L sorafenib alone were observed in vitro across cell lines. Response to sorafenib significantly correlated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) downregulation and loss of Mcl-1 expression (P < 0.05). Experiments with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 suggest a unique role for ERK downregulation in the observed effects. Sorafenib in combination with melphalan or temozolomide led to significantly improved responses in vitro (P < 0.05). In the animal model of melanoma, sorafenib in combination with regional melphalan or regional temozolomide was more effective than either treatment alone in slowing tumor growth. These results show that sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy provides a novel approach to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in the regional treatment of in-transit melanoma.","['Augustine, Christina K', 'Toshimitsu, Hiroaki', 'Jung, Sin-Ho', 'Zipfel, Patricia A', 'Yoo, Jin S', 'Yoshimoto, Yasunori', 'Selim, M Angelica', 'Burchette, James', 'Beasley, Georgia M', 'McMahon, Nicole', 'Padussis, James', 'Pruitt, Scott K', 'Ali-Osman, Francis', 'Tyler, Douglas S']","['Augustine CK', 'Toshimitsu H', 'Jung SH', 'Zipfel PA', 'Yoo JS', 'Yoshimoto Y', 'Selim MA', 'Burchette J', 'Beasley GM', 'McMahon N', 'Padussis J', 'Pruitt SK', 'Ali-Osman F', 'Tyler DS']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.

However, the resistance to Bcr-Abl TKIs is induced in leukemic cells not only by loss of sensitivity to TKIs through Bcr-Abl-related molecular mechanisms but also by loss of addiction to Bcr-Abl TK activity by acquiring Bcr-Abl-unrelated additional oncogenic mutations. Therefore, the identification of an additional therapeutic target has been anticipated for achievement of a complete cure and to overcome resistance to treatment. We here showed that modified human Galectin-9 (hGal9), a lectin that show specific affinity for beta-galactosides, inhibits the proliferation of five CML-derived cell lines by inducing apoptosis at their IC(50)s from 17.5 to 164.9 nmol/L. Our study revealed that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the ATF/cAMP-responsive element binding protein family transcription factors, is the critical mediator for cell killing by hGal9, and that Noxa is one of the downstream effector molecules of ATF3. Bim, on the other hand, the BH3-only protein essential for apoptosis by Bcr-Abl TKIs, was not associated with hGal9-induced cell death. ATF3-mediated cell death by hGal9 was not hampered by the absence of p53, the presence of mutant Abl(T315I), or by P-glycoprotein overexpression. In addition, hGal9 showed the additive growth-inhibitory effect with imatinib on CML cell lines. Collectively, hGal9 is a candidate agent that may overcome various kinds of resistance to treatment for CML and may suggest that ATF3 may be a new target molecule for the development of new treatment modalities that can overcome resistance to currently available chemotherapeutics.","['Kuroda, Junya', 'Yamamoto, Mio', 'Nagoshi, Hisao', 'Kobayashi, Tsutomu', 'Sasaki, Nana', 'Shimura, Yuji', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Yamauchi, Akira', 'Hirashima, Mitsuomi', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Kuroda J', 'Yamamoto M', 'Nagoshi H', 'Kobayashi T', 'Sasaki N', 'Shimura Y', 'Horiike S', 'Kimura S', 'Yamauchi A', 'Hirashima M', 'Taniwaki M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. junkuro@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Galectins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Transfection']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0040 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0040 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2010 Jul;8(7):994-1001. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0040.

FLT3/ITD results in constitutive autophosphorylation of the receptor and factor-independent survival in leukemia cell lines. The C-28 methyl ester of the oleane triterpenoid (CDDO-Me) is a multifunctional molecule that induces apoptosis of human myeloid leukemia cells. Here, we report that CDDO-Me blocks targeting of NFkappaB to the nucleus by inhibiting IkappaB kinase beta-mediated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Moreover, CDDO-Me blocked constitutive activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. We report the potent and selective antiproliferative effects of CDDO-Me on FLT3/ITD-positive myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary AML cells. The present studies show that CDDO-Me treatment results in caspase-3-mediated induction of apoptosis of FLT3/ITD-expressing cells and its antiproliferative effects are synergistic with PKC412, a FLT3-tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Taken together, our studies indicate that CDDO-Me greatly enhanced the efficacy of the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412, suggesting that combining two separate pathway inhibitors might be a viable therapeutic strategy for AML associated with a FLT3/ITD mutation.","['Ahmad, Rehan', 'Liu, Suiyang', 'Weisberg, Ellen', 'Nelson, Erik', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Meyer, Colin', 'Kufe, Donald', 'Kharbanda, Surender', 'Stone, Richard']","['Ahmad R', 'Liu S', 'Weisberg E', 'Nelson E', 'Galinsky I', 'Meyer C', 'Kufe D', 'Kharbanda S', 'Stone R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0154 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0154 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2010 Jul;8(7):986-93. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0154.

In some cell types this is the result of enhanced stability of bcl-2 mRNA, which is controlled by elements in its 3'-untranslated region. Nucleolin is one of the proteins that binds to bcl-2 mRNA, thereby increasing its half-life. Here, we examined the site on the bcl-2 3'-untranslated region that is bound by nucleolin as well as the protein binding domains important for bcl-2 mRNA recognition. RNase footprinting and RNA fragment binding assays demonstrated that nucleolin binds to a 40-nucleotide region at the 5' end of the 136-nucleotide bcl-2 AU-rich element (ARE(bcl-2)). The first two RNA binding domains of nucleolin were sufficient for high affinity binding to ARE(bcl-2). In RNA decay assays, ARE(bcl-2) transcripts were protected from exosomal decay by the addition of nucleolin. AUF1 has been shown to recruit the exosome to mRNAs. When MV-4-11 cell extracts were immunodepleted of AUF1, the rate of decay of ARE(bcl-2) transcripts was reduced, indicating that nucleolin and AUF1 have opposing roles in bcl-2 mRNA turnover. When the function of nucleolin in MV-4-11 cells was impaired by treatment with the nucleolin-targeting aptamer AS1411, association of AUF1 with bcl-2 mRNA was increased. This suggests that the degradation of bcl-2 mRNA induced by AS1411 results from both interference with nucleolin protection of bcl-2 mRNA and recruitment of the exosome by AUF1. Based on our findings, we propose a model that illustrates the opposing roles of nucleolin and AUF1 in regulating bcl-2 mRNA stability.","['Ishimaru, Daniella', 'Zuraw, Lisa', 'Ramalingam, Sivakumar', 'Sengupta, Tapas K', 'Bandyopadhyay, Sumita', 'Reuben, Adrian', 'Fernandes, Daniel J', 'Spicer, Eleanor K']","['Ishimaru D', 'Zuraw L', 'Ramalingam S', 'Sengupta TK', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Reuben A', 'Fernandes DJ', 'Spicer EK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina 29409.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.

Vatalanib and pazopanib are potent orally available VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We investigated the efficacy and selectivity of both compounds in CLL cells, simulated potential combination with conventional cytostatics, and tested the effect of both substances on CLL-like tumor xenografts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary CLL and normal peripheral blood cells were tested for viability after incubation with varying concentrations of both inhibitors. Further, phosphorylation status of VEGF receptor on treatment, caspase activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were assessed. Combinations of each inhibitor with fludarabine, vincristine, and doxorubicin were analyzed for possible synergistic effects in vitro. For in vivo testing, mice grafted with the CLL-like cell line JVM-3 were treated orally with each inhibitor. RESULTS: Vatalanib and pazopanib decreased phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor, along with induction of apoptosis in CLL cells in clinically achievable concentrations. Healthy B cells were only mildly affected. Immunoblots showed downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and MCL1, whereas poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was increased. Combinations with conventional cytostatic agents resulted in synergistic effects. Treatment of xenografted mice with 100 mg/kg of body weight for 21 days resulted in tumor inhibition rates of 76% (vatalanib) and 77% (pazopanib). In two mice, a total tumor eradication could be observed. No gross systemic toxicity occurred. CONCLUSION: We conclude that VEGF inhibition is a promising new therapeutic approach in CLL. Vatalanib and pazopanib seem to be effective and safe candidates to be further evaluated for this purpose.","['Paesler, Julian', 'Gehrke, Iris', 'Gandhirajan, Rajesh Kumar', 'Filipovich, Alexandra', 'Hertweck, Magdalena', 'Erdfelder, Felix', 'Uhrmacher, Sabrina', 'Poll-Wolbeck, Simon Jonas', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Paesler J', 'Gehrke I', 'Gandhirajan RK', 'Filipovich A', 'Hertweck M', 'Erdfelder F', 'Uhrmacher S', 'Poll-Wolbeck SJ', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100622,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '5DX9U76296 (vatalanib)', '7RN5DR86CK (pazopanib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Indazoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phthalazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-0232 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0232 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Jul 1;16(13):3390-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0232.

CONCLUSIONS: There is no association between risk of early childhood cancers and estimates of the mother's exposure to mobile phone base stations during pregnancy.","['Elliott, Paul', 'Toledano, Mireille B', 'Bennett, J', 'Beale, L', 'de Hoogh, K', 'Best, N', 'Briggs, D J']","['Elliott P', 'Toledano MB', 'Bennett J', 'Beale L', 'de Hoogh K', 'Best N', 'Briggs DJ']","[""Small Area Health Statistics Unit, MRC-HPA Centre for Environment and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, St Mary's Campus, London W2 1PG. p.elliott@imperial.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['*Cell Phone', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Residence Characteristics', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1136/bmj.c3077 [doi]'],epublish,BMJ. 2010 Jun 22;340:c3077. doi: 10.1136/bmj.c3077.,,,"['G0801056/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",PMC3191724,,['BMJ. 2010;340:c3015.

Here we show that Ldb1 controls gene expression at multiple levels. Ldb1 stabilizes its erythroid complex partners on beta-globin chromatin, even though it is not one of the DNA-binding components. In addition, Ldb1 is necessary for enrichment of key transcriptional components in the locus, including P-TEFb, which phosphorylates Ser2 of the RNA polymerase C-terminal domain for efficient elongation. Furthermore, reduction of Ldb1 results in the inability of the locus to migrate away from the nuclear periphery, which is necessary to achieve robust transcription of beta-globin in nuclear transcription factories. Ldb1 contributes these critical functions at both embryonic and adult stages of globin gene expression. These results implicate Ldb1 as a factor that facilitates nuclear relocation for transcription activation.","['Song, Sang-Hyun', 'Kim, AeRi', 'Ragoczy, Tobias', 'Bender, M A', 'Groudine, Mark', 'Dean, Ann']","['Song SH', 'Kim A', 'Ragoczy T', 'Bender MA', 'Groudine M', 'Dean A']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100622,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Locus Control Region', 'Metalloproteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/chemistry/metabolism', 'Serine/chemistry', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'beta-Globins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34557-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-272252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 30;116(13):2356-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-272252.

The mechanisms underlying BL chemoresistance and how it can be circumvented remain undetermined. We previously reported the frequent inactivation of the proapoptotic BIM gene in B-cell lymphomas. Here we show that BIM epigenetic silencing by concurrent promoter hypermethylation and deacetylation occurs frequently in primary BL samples and BL-derived cell lines. Remarkably, patients with BL with hypermethylated BIM presented lower complete remission rate (24% vs 79%; P = .002) and shorter overall survival (P = .007) than those with BIM-expressing lymphomas, indicating that BIM transcriptional repression may mediate tumor chemoresistance. Accordingly, by combining in vitro and in vivo studies of human BL-xenografts grown in immunodeficient RAG2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice and of murine B220(+)IgM(+) B-cell lymphomas generated in Emu-MYC and Emu-MYC-BIM(+/-) transgenes, we demonstrate that lymphoma chemoresistance is dictated by BIM gene dosage and is reversible on BIM reactivation by genetic manipulation or after treatment with histone-deacetylase inhibitors. We suggest that the combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitors and high-dose chemotherapy may overcome chemoresistance, achieve durable remission, and improve survival of patients with BL.","['Richter-Larrea, Jose A', 'Robles, Eloy F', 'Fresquet, Vicente', 'Beltran, Elena', 'Rullan, Antonio J', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Panizo, Carlos', 'Richter, Jose A', 'Hernandez, Jesus M', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A']","['Richter-Larrea JA', 'Robles EF', 'Fresquet V', 'Beltran E', 'Rullan AJ', 'Agirre X', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Panizo C', 'Richter JA', 'Hernandez JM', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Prosper F', 'Martinez-Climent JA']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31303-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-268003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 7;116(14):2531-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-268003.

The resulting limited knowledge about cell surface protein markers hampers early clinical diagnosis and subclassification of hematologic malignancies. Here, we describe the mass spectrometry based phenotyping of 2 all-trans retinoic acid treated acute myeloid leukemia model systems at an unprecedented level to a depth of more than 500 membrane proteins, including 137 bona fide cell surface exposed CD proteins. This extensive view of the leukemia surface proteome was achieved by developing and applying new implementations of the Cell Surface Capturing (CSC) technology. Bioinformatic and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the applied strategy reliably revealed known differentiation-induced abundance changes of cell surface proteins in HL60 and NB4 cells and it also identified cell surface proteins with very little prior information. The extensive and quantitative analysis of the cell surface protein landscape from a systems biology perspective will be most useful in the clinic for the improved subclassification of hematologic malignancies and the identification of new drug targets.","['Hofmann, Andreas', 'Gerrits, Bertran', 'Schmidt, Alexander', 'Bock, Thomas', 'Bausch-Fluck, Damaris', 'Aebersold, Rudolf', 'Wollscheid, Bernd']","['Hofmann A', 'Gerrits B', 'Schmidt A', 'Bock T', 'Bausch-Fluck D', 'Aebersold R', 'Wollscheid B']","['Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34565-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-02-271270 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 30;116(13):e26-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-02-271270.

In a systemic model of murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML), tumor progression resulted in increased regulatory T cells (Treg) and elevation of program death-1 (PD-1) expression on CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) at the tumor site. PD-1 knockout mice were more resistant to AML despite the presence of similar percentage of Tregs compared with wild type. In vitro, intact Treg suppression of CD8(+) T-cell responses was dependent on PD-1 expression by T cells and Tregs and PD-L1 expression by antigen-presenting cells. In vivo, the function of adoptively transferred AML-reactive CTLs was reduced by AML-associated Tregs. Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody treatment increased the proliferation and function of CTLs at tumor sites, reduced AML tumor burden, and resulted in long-term survivors. Treg depletion followed by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade showed superior efficacy for eradication of established AML. These data demonstrated that interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 can facilitate Treg-induced suppression of T-effector cells and dampen the antitumor immune response. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade coupled with Treg depletion represents an important new approach that can be readily translated into the clinic to improve the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive AML-reactive CTLs in advanced AML disease.","['Zhou, Qing', 'Munger, Meghan E', 'Highfill, Steven L', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'Weigel, Brenda J', 'Riddle, Megan', 'Sharpe, Arlene H', 'Vallera, Daniel A', 'Azuma, Miyuki', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'June, Carl H', 'Murphy, William J', 'Munn, David H', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Zhou Q', 'Munger ME', 'Highfill SL', 'Tolar J', 'Weigel BJ', 'Riddle M', 'Sharpe AH', 'Vallera DA', 'Azuma M', 'Levine BL', 'June CH', 'Murphy WJ', 'Munn DH', 'Blazar BR']","['Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31298-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-275446 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 7;116(14):2484-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-275446.

Cryopreserved CD34(+) UCB cells from twelve different human donors were transplanted into sublethally irradiated NOD/shi-scid Jic mice. In parallel, the gene expression profiles of the UCB cells were determined from oligonucleotide microarrays. UCB cells from three donors failed to establish an engraftment in the host mice, while the other nine succeeded to various extents. Gene expression profiling indicated that 71 genes, including HOXB4, C/EBP-beta, and ETS2, were specifically overexpressed and 23 genes were suppressed more than 2-fold in the successful UCB cells compared to those that failed. Functional annotation revealed that cell growth and cell cycle regulators were more abundant in the successful UCB cells.

Considering the heterogeneity of haematological malignancies, the growing arsenal of compounds, allowing targeted therapy, e.g. in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), and the more differentiated indication to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, routine diagnostic procedures would highly benefit from an introduction of this novel methodology: by now, the majority of genetically defined leukaemia subtypes has been accurately reproduced on the basis of distinct gene expression patterns by various independent research groups. Moreover, classification of histomorphologically overlapping lymphoma subentities (e.g. Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), was considerably improved by GEP. Beyond that, differential gene expression has provided the basis for assays being able to predict prognosis of individual patients as well as the response to specific treatment approaches, e.g. to lenalidomide in MDS. In a high proportion of Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients, prognostically adverse deletions of the IKZF1 gene coding for a specific transcription factor were identified with GEP analysis, which revealed new insights in the clinical variability of this disorder. Given these advantages of GEP, the introduction of this methodology in current diagnostic algorithms of haematological malignancies should further be validated in clinical studies.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Kohlmann A', 'Haferlach T']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH), Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100608,Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Prognosis']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(10)00101-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2010 Dec;36(8):637-46. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.05.002.

Specific inhibitors for the JAK2 tyrosine kinase are now in active development for myeloproliferative disorders and may become a new class of targeted therapeutics.

Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can lead to growth arrest by secreting leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in MTC cells harboring a RET receptor domain mutation. Here, we report that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK can also mediate, via LIF, growth inhibition in MTC cells harboring a RET kinase domain mutation. Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK activation was sufficient to induce growth inhibition and LIF expression in the human MTC line MZ-CRC-1. Presence of LIF-mediated signaling was determined by blocking the activity of culture medium conditioned by Raf-activated cells using anti-LIF neutralizing antibody. In addition, recombinant LIF effectively suppressed cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Expression of dominant negative STAT3 abrogated LIF effects, indicating that LIF mediates its signaling through the JAK/STAT3 pathway. These results suggest that growth inhibition and activation of the autocrine/paracrine signaling through LIF/JAK/STAT may be a common response to Ras/Raf activation in different MTC types, and justify further evaluation of LIF as a potential anticancer agent for MTC.","['Arthan, Dumrongkiet', 'Hong, Seung-Keun', 'Park, Jong-In']","['Arthan D', 'Hong SK', 'Park JI']","['Department of Biochemistry, The Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100531,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Autocrine Communication', 'Carcinoma, Medullary/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(10)00236-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2010.04.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 Nov 1;297(1):31-41. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2010.04.021.

Here we demonstrate that human iPSC reprogramming in the presence of LIF yields human stem cells that display morphological, molecular, and functional properties of murine ESCs. We termed these hLR5 iPSCs because they require the expression of five ectopic reprogramming factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc, and Nanog, to maintain this more naive state. The cells are ""metastable"" and upon ectopic factor withdrawal they revert to standard human iPSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that the hLR5 state facilitates gene targeting, and as such provides a powerful tool for the generation of recombinant human pluripotent stem cell lines.","['Buecker, Christa', 'Chen, Hsu-Hsin', 'Polo, Jose Maria', 'Daheron, Laurence', 'Bu, Lei', 'Barakat, Tahsin Stefan', 'Okwieka, Patricia', 'Porter, Andrew', 'Gribnau, Joost', 'Hochedlinger, Konrad', 'Geijsen, Niels']","['Buecker C', 'Chen HH', 'Polo JM', 'Daheron L', 'Bu L', 'Barakat TS', 'Okwieka P', 'Porter A', 'Gribnau J', 'Hochedlinger K', 'Geijsen N']","['Center for Regenerative Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Cell Dedifferentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Sequence Homology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2009/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(10)00213-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2010.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2010 Jun 4;6(6):535-46. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2010.05.003.,,,"['R01 HD048769/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD048769-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD048769-03S1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3162213,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether human leukemia HL-60 cells differentiating by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) acquired resistance to the apoptogenic activity of two histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, butyrate and valproate. In undifferentiated cells, the cytotoxicity of both butyrate and valproate was associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway since we observed dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities, appearance of sub-G1 DNA and loss of plasma membrane asymmetry and/or integrity. Both HDAC inhibitors were also able to induce accumulation of undifferentiated cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. ATRA was found to enhance the apoptotic effect of both butyrate and valproate in undifferentiated cells. This aside, ATRA appeared to synergize with butyrate in the induction of the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. In cells pretreated for 72 h with ATRA, butyrate and valproate in combination with ATRA induced lower dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and weaker apoptotic and/or necrotic changes in plasma membrane, whereas DNA fragmentation was not diminished compared to undifferentiated cells. Similar results were also obtained when butyrate or valproate were combined with another neutrophilic differentiation inducer, dimethyl sulfoxide. We conclude that neutrophilic differentiation modulates but does not abrogate the apoptotic response of HL-60 cells to butyrate and valproate, and nuclei are preferentially affected during apoptosis in differentiated cells.","['Vrba, J', 'Dolezel, P', 'Ulrichova, J']","['Vrba J', 'Dolezel P', 'Ulrichova J']","['Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. vrbambv@seznam.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2010/06/24 06:00,2010/12/31 06:00,['2010/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2010_05_438 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2010;57(5):438-48. doi: 10.4149/neo_2010_05_438.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reliable prognosis of this disease at the time of initial diagnosis is difficult to predict. The purpose of this preliminary study was to utilize the nucleolar morphology and to investigate the incidence of main nucleolar types in leukemic lymphocytes in B-CLL patients to assess their possible predictive value for the disease outcome, in correlation with immunophenotype parameters. The evaluation of nucleolar morphology of pathologic lymphocytes was performed at diagnosis and during the course of disease. Median follow up period of patients was 16.4 months (range from 2 to 32 months) from diagnosis. The nucleoli were visualized by a simple cytochemical demonstration of RNA and the proportion of main nucleolar types in pathologic lymphocyte population infiltrating bone marrow of 84 patients suffering from B-CLL was analyzed. The presence of ring shaped and compact nucleoli in leukemic lymphocytes divided patients into two subgroups with different outcome of the disease. Malignant lymphocytes of the majority of patients (Group 1, 71 patients, 84.5%) mostly contained ring shaped nucleoli. These patients were in stable phase and did not require any treatment during the follow up. The population of leukemic cells of a small group of B-CLL patients (Group 2, 13 patients, 15.4%) was characterized by the presence of various proportions of pathologic lymphocytes with one large compact nucleolus.Different response to the therapy discriminated the B-CLL patients whose leukemic lymphocytes revealed evident compact nucleoli at presentation, to next two subsets. Four of these patients (Group 2, 4/13, 31%) appeared to be resistant to chemotherapy, others (9/13, 69%) showed response to therapy, though the response time was variable. Leukemic cells with compact nucleolus morphologically resembled prolymphocytes, but hematologically and immunophenotypically did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for prolymphocyte population. None of our B-CLL patients had the signs of transformation to prolymphocytic or other type of B cell neoplasms during the follow up. Our results indicate the possibility of relationship between the presence of malignant lymphocytes with compact nucleoli and unfavorable outcome in patients with B-CLL. The simplicity and utility of the nucleolar test as a possible prognostic parameter may help to identify the subset of patients with early B-CLL disease that will run a more progressive course.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Kusenda, J', 'Stevulova, L', 'Kovarikova, A', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Kusenda J', 'Stevulova L', 'Kovarikova A', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.

Most patients were at a relatively early stage of the disease. After a median follow-up of about 2 years, addition of rituximab increased median progression-free survival by about 7 to 10 months. It was also associated with a higher complete response rate (about 10% to 20% higher). Follow-up was too short to reliably estimate the possible impact on overall survival.

Control group consisted of 125 healthy children (72 boys) from the same region of Poland. Genetic polymorphisms were determined by RFLP method (restriction fragment length polymorphism) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: In both group heterozygotes were most prevalent (Ff--54%, Ff--51.2% and Bb--54.5%, Bb--51.2%). The BB genotype was significantly more frequent in the leukemia group than in the control group (p = 0.034). The co-occurence of f and B alleles were observed with prevalence twice as high in the leukemia group in comparison with the control group (p = 0.023).

METHODS: We studied patients with CD5+B-CLPD to (1) more completely define the clinical features and pathology of CD5+B-CLPD, (2) compare these features to patients presenting with typical CLL, and (3) test the hypothesis that a subset of patients with CD5+B-CLPD could have a unique B-cell malignancy. RESULTS: We identified 229 patients with CD5+B-CLPD. A definitive pathological diagnosis was made in all 61 (27%) CD5+B-CLPD patients with nonbone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens considered adequate for a comprehensive pathological examination. The most common diagnosis among these 61 patients was CLL (44%) followed by the leukemic phase of marginal zone lymphoma (34%), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (11%), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (8%), and high-grade B cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (2%). In contrast, among 168 patients without a non-BM tissue biopsy specimen, a specific diagnosis could be made on review of all available data in only 24 (14%) with 144 (86%) remaining ""unclassified.""

Elevated levels of CCL18 have been described in various diseases including childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) but its functions remain poorly characterized. Its receptor has not been identified, but functional cellular responses like lymphocyte chemotaxis have been described. CXCL12 is a pivotal chemokine for hematopoiesis and B cell homing processes. We demonstrate that CCL18 interferes with CXCL12-mediated pre-B ALL cell activation. CXCL12-induced calcium mobilization, chemotaxis, pseudo-emperipolesis and cellular proliferation could be significantly reduced by CCL18 in pre-B ALL cell lines. The results could be observed in primary cells from patients suffering from pre-B ALL, but not in cells from patients suffering from common ALL. Direct effects of CCL18 on the receptor for CXCL12, CXCR4, could be excluded. Moreover, we found that CCL18 modulations of CXCL12-induced responses are mediated through the chemokine-like receptor GPR30. CCL18 bound to GPR30 expressing cells, and antibodies against GPR30 abolished this binding as well as CCL18-mediated functional effects. We also observed that, CCL18 interferes with the activation of GPR30 by previously identified ligands (17beta-estradiol and chemical agonists). We therefore suggest that CCL18 is an important modulator of CXCR4-dependent responses in pre-B ALL cells via interactions with GPR30.","['Catusse, J', 'Wollner, S', 'Leick, M', 'Schrottner, P', 'Schraufstatter, I', 'Burger, M']","['Catusse J', 'Wollner S', 'Leick M', 'Schrottner P', 'Schraufstatter I', 'Burger M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CCL18 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (GPER1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Chemokines, CC/*metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection']",2010/06/23 06:00,2010/10/13 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22284 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 Nov;225(3):792-800. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22284.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated how these factors are involved in the stress response triggered by resazurin (Alamar Blue) in cultured cancer cells. Resazurin is a redox reactive compound widely used as reporter agent in assays of cell biology (e.g. cell viability and metabolic activity) due to its colorimetric and fluorimetric properties. In order to investigate resazurin-induced stress mechanisms we employed cells affording different metabolic and regulatory phenotypes. In HL-60 and Jurkat leukemia cells resazurin caused mitochondrial disintegration, respiratory dysfunction, reduced proliferation, and cell death. These effects were preceded by a burst of ROS, especially in HL-60 cells which were also more sensitive and contained autophagic vesicles. Studies in Rho(0) cells (devoid of mitochondrial DNA) indicated that the stress response does not depend on the rates of mitochondrial respiration. The anti-proliferative effect of resazurin was confirmed in native acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts. In conclusion, the data suggest that resazurin triggers cellular ROS production and thereby initiates a stress response leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced proliferation, autophagy, and cell degradation. The ability of cells to tolerate this type of stress may be important in toxicity and chemoresistance.","['Erikstein, Bjarte S', 'Hagland, Hanne R', 'Nikolaisen, Julie', 'Kulawiec, Mariola', 'Singh, Keshav K', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T', 'Tronstad, Karl J']","['Erikstein BS', 'Hagland HR', 'Nikolaisen J', 'Kulawiec M', 'Singh KK', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Tronstad KJ']","['Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '1FN9YD6968 (resazurin)']",IM,"['Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*pathology', 'Oxazines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Xanthenes/*pharmacology']",2010/06/23 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22741 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Oct 15;111(3):574-84. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22741.,,,"['R01 CA113655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA121904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA121904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '113655/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC2946440,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS217368'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) expression predicts poor prognosis in PC patients. Recent evidence suggests that BMI1 may also play a role in docetaxel chemoresistance. However, mechanisms and clinical significance of BMI1-related chemoresistance have not been investigated. For this purpose, BMI1 was silenced in 2 PC cell lines (LNCaP and DU 145). Cell proliferation and apoptosis after docetaxel treatment were measured. Guanine oxidation was assessed by in-cell western. Global gene expression analysis was performed on BMI1 silenced cells. Oncomine database was used to compare in vitro data with gene expression in PC samples. BMI1 silencing had no effect on cell proliferation but significantly enhanced docetaxel-induced antitumor activity. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that BMI1 silencing downregulates a set of antioxidant genes. Docetaxel treatment increased guanine oxidation, whereas the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine rescued docetaxel-induced cell death. Examination of clinical datasets revealed a positive correlation of BMI1 and antioxidant gene expression. BMI1-controlled antioxidant genes were predictive of poor prognosis in PC patients. In conclusion, BMI1 enhances antioxidant response, thereby allowing PC survival after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. BMI1-controlled antioxidant genes are overexpressed in aggressive PC and should be tested as predictors of chemotherapy failure.","['Crea, Francesco', 'Duhagon Serrat, Maria A', 'Hurt, Elaine M', 'Thomas, Suneetha B', 'Danesi, Romano', 'Farrar, William L']","['Crea F', 'Duhagon Serrat MA', 'Hurt EM', 'Thomas SB', 'Danesi R', 'Farrar WL']","['National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Taxoids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/06/23 06:00,2011/04/19 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25522 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Apr 15;128(8):1946-54. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25522.,,,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010253-12/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3265034,['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],,,['NIHMS341948'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is endemic in Western Africa and Southern Japan, whereas HTLV-2 is considered to be spread among native American people. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The impact of HTLV in gynaecology and obstetrics is being reviewed. Search strategy and selection criteria for identifying relevant data were performed by searching Medline, Current Contents, Web of Science, Embase and references from relevant articles. English and German gynaecological and infectious diseases textbooks as well as national and international guidelines and recommendations were also reviewed. RESULTS: Transmission may occur by sexual intercourse or cellular blood products. Although materno-fetal transmission is debated, transmission through maternal breast milk has been confirmed. An HTLV-infection can lead to adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) or cumulative opportunistic and neurological disorders that can occur with varying degrees of severity. Diagnosis can be done by antibody detection via the use of ELISA and western blot analysis as well as PCR diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Due to inadequate treatment options and the lack of an effective vaccination, prevention is currently only possible by restricting transmission, including the usage of condoms during sexual intercourse or avoiding breastfeeding in HTLV-seropositive mothers. If, due to socio-economic reasons, breastfeeding cannot be avoided, short-term breastfeeding for a maximum of up to 6 months is suggested.","['Mylonas, Ioannis', 'Bruning, Ansgar', 'Kainer, Franz', 'Friese, Klaus']","['Mylonas I', 'Bruning A', 'Kainer F', 'Friese K']","['First Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany. ioannis.mylonas@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100622,Germany,Arch Gynecol Obstet,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,8710213,,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Feeding/adverse effects', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/virology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/*virology']",2010/06/23 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2009/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00404-010-1559-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2010 Nov;282(5):493-501. doi: 10.1007/s00404-010-1559-1.

However, their significance in acute leukemias is lacking. This study was planned to investigate expression and significance of these proteases in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CTSL and CTSB activities were assayed in PBMCs of 24 children with AML and ten healthy controls by spectrofluorimetry. The mRNA levels of these proteases and their specific endogenous inhibitor cystatin C and transcriptional upregulator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were quantitated by real-time PCR. Correlation analysis of CTSL and CTSB activities/expression with their inhibitor/upregulator and event-free survival (EFS) was done using appropriate statistical tools. CTSL and CTSB protease activity and their mRNA expression were significantly higher in AML patients compared to controls (p </= 0.001). A strong positive correlation was observed between VEGF expression and CTSL (r = 0.812; p </= 0.001). Similarly, VEGF exhibited a strong positive correlation with CTSB (r = 0.501; p = 0.013). Cystatin expression though significantly high (p </= 0.001) in AML was negatively correlated with CTSL (r = -0.920; p </= 0.001) and CTSB (r = -0.580, p </= 0.001) expression.

This is the first report demonstrating increased expression of CTSL and CTSB in AML, mechanism of their increased expression in relation to VEGF, and their association with poor EFS and OS. These results suggest a potential utility of these proteases as prognostic markers for this malignancy.","['Jain, Misti', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Shukla, Abhay A', 'Chauhan, Shyam S']","['Jain M', 'Bakhshi S', 'Shukla AA', 'Chauhan SS']","['Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Room No. 3009, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100622,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cystatin C)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Cathepsin B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cathepsin L/genetics/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystatin C/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics']",2010/06/23 06:00,2011/02/03 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1012-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Dec;89(12):1223-32. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1012-3.

Recently, demethylating agents have become available as a promising new treatment for patients with MDS. In two randomized clinical trials, the demethylating agent azacitidine has demonstrated a reduced risk of transformation to AML, improvement of peripheral blood values, an improved quality of life, and a definite survival advantage compared to conventional care regimens for patients with International Prognostic Scoring System score of intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS. This review aims to provide practical recommendations for the use of azacitidine and the management of its side effects in patients with MDS, assuring safe administration and best efficacy of treatment.","['Gotze, Katharina', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten']","['Gotze K', 'Platzbecker U', 'Giagounidis A', 'Haase D', 'Lubbert M', 'Aul C', 'Ganser A', 'Germing U', 'Hofmann WK']","['III.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 805 adults (age range, 16 to 60 years) with AML enrolled on German-Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) treatment trials AML HD98A and APL HD95 for mutations in exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2. Patients were also studied for NPM1, FLT3, MLL, and CEBPA mutations. The median follow-up for survival was 6.3 years. RESULTS: IDH mutations were found in 129 patients (16.0%) -IDH1 in 61 patients (7.6%), and IDH2 in 70 patients (8.7%). Two patients had both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All but one IDH1 mutation caused substitutions of residue R132; IDH2 mutations caused changes of R140 (n = 48) or R172 (n = 22). IDH mutations were associated with older age (P < .001; effect conferred by IDH2 only); lower WBC (P = .04); higher platelets (P < .001); cytogenetically normal (CN) -AML (P< .001); and NPM1 mutations, in particular with the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; P < .001). In patients with CN-AML with the latter genotype, IDH mutations adversely impacted relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .02) and overall survival (P = .03), whereas outcome was not affected in patients with CN-AML who lacked this genotype. In CN-AML, multivariable analyses revealed a significant interaction between IDH mutation and the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (ie, the adverse impact of IDH mutation [RFS]; P = .046 was restricted to this patient subset). CONCLUSION: IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurring genetic changes in AML. They constitute a poor prognostic factor in CN-AML with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, which allows refined risk stratification of this AML subset.","['Paschka, Peter', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Habdank, Marianne', 'Kronke, Jan', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Zucknick, Manuela', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Horst, Heinz-A', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Paschka P', 'Schlenk RF', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Habdank M', 'Kronke J', 'Bullinger L', 'Spath D', 'Kayser S', 'Zucknick M', 'Gotze K', 'Horst HA', 'Germing U', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100621,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

In the early 1950s, an experimental and clinical program characterized by unique cross-fertilization was developed. The clinical importance of experimental animal models in drug screening and in establishing key chemotherapy concepts and the role of the pioneers of medical oncology in the design of the various phases of drug trials, using childhood acute leukemia and breast cancer as models, are discussed. Over a short time and with only a few drugs, principles of chemotherapy were laid out, which led to cures in such diseases as childhood acute leukemia and Hodgkin's disease and to improved disease-free survival in breast cancer. It is these and other achievements that paved the way to medical oncology. At the instigation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Board of Internal Medicine made inquiries about a subspecialty in oncology. ASCO and B. J. Kennedy, MD, played key roles in the events leading to the official recognition of medical oncology as a new subspecialty of internal medicine in 1972.","['Band, Pierre R']",['Band PR'],"['Health Canada, Saint-Lambert, Quebec, Canada.

A gene expression analysis performed in a phase 1 trial of vorinostat in leukemia indicated that overexpression of genes involved in antioxidant defense was associated with clinical resistance. We hypothesized that nonepigenetic mechanisms may be involved in resistance to HDACI therapy in leukemia. Here we confirmed up-regulation of a series of antioxidants in a pan-HDACI-resistant leukemia cell line HL60/LR. Vorinostat induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase in leukemia cells. An increase in ROS resulted in translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 from cytosol to nucleus, leading to up-regulation of antioxidant genes, including a majority of glutathione-associated enzymes as a cellular protective mechanism. Addition of beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate, a natural compound capable of depleting cellular glutathione, significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of vorinostat in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells by inhibiting the cytoprotective antioxidant response. These results suggest that ROS plays an important role in action of vorinostat and that combination with a redox-modulating compound increases sensitivity to HDACIs and also overcomes vorinostat resistance. Such a combination strategy may be an effective therapeutic regimen and have potential clinical application in leukemia.","['Hu, Yumin', 'Lu, Weiqin', 'Chen, Gang', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Jia, Yu', 'Wei, Yue', 'Yang, Hui', 'Zhang, Wan', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Bhalla, Kapil', 'Keating, Michael', 'Huang, Peng', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Hu Y', 'Lu W', 'Chen G', 'Zhang H', 'Jia Y', 'Wei Y', 'Yang H', 'Zhang W', 'Fiskus W', 'Bhalla K', 'Keating M', 'Huang P', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

We found that miR-29a is up-regulated in indolent human B-CLL as compared with aggressive B-CLL and normal CD19(+) B cells. To study the role of miR-29 in B-CLL, we generated Emu-miR-29 transgenic mice overexpressing miR-29 in mouse B cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a markedly expanded CD5(+) population in the spleen of these mice starting at 2 mo of age, with 85% (34/40) of miR-29 transgenic mice exhibiting expanded CD5(+) B-cell populations, a characteristic of B-CLL. On average, 50% of B cells in these transgenic mice were CD5 positive.

Of 20 Emu-miR-29 transgenic mice followed to 24-26 mo of age, 4 (20%) developed frank leukemia and died of the disease.

Based on its evolutionary relationship to activation-induced deaminase, Apobec3 might directly influence Ab class switching and affinity maturation independently of viral infection. Alternatively, the antiviral activity of Apobec3 may indirectly influence neutralizing Ab responses by reducing early FV-induced pathology in critical immune compartments. To distinguish between these possibilities, we immunized wild-type and Apobec3-deficient C57BL/6 (B6) mice with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl (NP) hapten and evaluated the binding affinity of the resultant NP-specific Abs. These studies revealed similar affinity maturation of NP-specific IgG1 Abs between wild-type and Apobec3-deficient mice in the absence of FV infection. In contrast, hapten-specific Ab affinity maturation was significantly compromised in Apobec3-deficient mice infected with FV. In highly susceptible (B6 x A.BY)F(1) mice, the B6 Apobec3 gene protected multiple cell types in the bone marrow and spleen from acute FV infection, including erythroid, B, T, and myeloid cells. In addition, B6 Apobec3 deficiency was associated with elevated Ig levels, but decreased induction of splenic germinal center B cells and plasmablasts during acute FV infection.

The basic helix-loop-helix hemopoietic transcriptional regulator TAL1 (formerly SCL) is required for terminal differentiation of red blood cells. To gain insight into TAL1 function and mechanisms of action in erythropoiesis, we performed ChIP-sequencing and gene expression analyses from primary fetal liver erythroid cells. We show that TAL1 coordinates expression of genes in most known red cell-specific processes. The majority of TAL1's genomic targets require direct DNA-binding activity. However, one-fifth of TAL1's target sequences, mainly among those showing high affinity for TAL1, can recruit the factor independently of its DNA binding activity. An unbiased DNA motif search of sequences bound by TAL1 identified CAGNTG as TAL1-preferred E-box motif in erythroid cells. Novel motifs were also characterized that may help distinguish activated from repressed genes and suggest a new mechanism by which TAL1 may be recruited to DNA. Finally, analysis of recruitment of GATA1, a protein partner of TAL1, to sequences occupied by TAL1 suggests that TAL1's binding is necessary prior or simultaneous to that of GATA1. This work provides the framework to study regulatory networks leading to erythroid terminal maturation and to model mechanisms of action of tissue-specific transcription factors.","['Kassouf, Mira T', 'Hughes, Jim R', 'Taylor, Stephen', 'McGowan, Simon J', 'Soneji, Shamit', 'Green, Angela L', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Porcher, Catherine']","['Kassouf MT', 'Hughes JR', 'Taylor S', 'McGowan SJ', 'Soneji S', 'Green AL', 'Vyas P', 'Porcher C']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100621,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'E-Box Elements/genetics', 'Erythroid Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', '*Genome', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2010/06/23 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.104935.110 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.104935.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2010 Aug;20(8):1064-83. doi: 10.1101/gr.104935.110.

To get an insight into the mechanisms that control pluripotency and differentiation in these cells, we studied how differences observed during in vitro differentiation between ESCs and maGSCs are associated with differences at the level of microRNAs (miRNAs). In this work, we provide for a first time a connection between germ cell origin of maGSCs and their specific miRNA expression profile. We found that maGSCs express higher levels of germ cell markers characteristic for primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonia compared with ESCs. Retained expression of miR-290 cluster has been previously reported in maGSCs during differentiation and it was associated with higher Oct-4 levels. Here, we show that this property is also shared by another pluripotent cell line originating from the germ line, the embryonic germ cells. In addition, we provide proof that the specific miRNA expression profile of maGSCs has an impact on their differentiation potential. Low levels of miR-302 in maGSCs during the first 10 days of leukaemia inhibitory factor deprivation are shown to be necessary for the maintenance of high levels of early germ cell markers.","['Zovoilis, Athanasios', 'Pantazi, Angeliki', 'Smorag, Lukasz', 'Opitz, Lennart', 'Riester, Gabriela Salinas', 'Wolf, Marieke', 'Zechner, Ulrich', 'Holubowska, Anna', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Engel, Wolfgang']","['Zovoilis A', 'Pantazi A', 'Smorag L', 'Opitz L', 'Riester GS', 'Wolf M', 'Zechner U', 'Holubowska A', 'Stewart CL', 'Engel W']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Goettingen, 37073 Goettingen, Germany. azovoil@gwdg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100621,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Computer Simulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', '*MicroRNAs', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/06/23 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gaq053 [pii]', '10.1093/molehr/gaq053 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2010 Nov;16(11):793-803. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gaq053.

It negatively regulates osteoblast activity, and, as such, its inhibition is a potential means to prevent bone loss. Dasatinib is a new dual Src/Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor initially developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. It has also shown promising results in preclinical studies in various solid tumors. However, its effects on the differentiation of human osteoblasts have never been examined. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of dasatinib on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) differentiation into osteoblasts, in the presence or absence of a mixture of dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate (DAG) for up to 21 days. The differentiation kinetics was assessed by evaluating mineralization of the extracellular matrix, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and expression of osteoblastic markers (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand [RANKL], bone sialoprotein [BSP], osteopontin [OPN]). RESULTS: Dasatinib significantly increased the activity of ALP and the level of calcium deposition in MSC cultured with DAG after, respectively, 7 and 14 days; it upregulated the expression of BSP and OPN genes independently of DAG; and it markedly downregulated the expression of RANKL gene and protein (decrease in RANKL/OPG ratio), the key factor that stimulates osteoclast differentiation and activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a dual role for dasatinib in both (i) stimulating osteoblast differentiation leading to a direct increase in bone formation, and (ii) downregulating RANKL synthesis by osteoblasts leading to an indirect inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, dasatinib is a potentially interesting candidate drug for the treatment of osteolysis through its dual effect on bone metabolism.","['Id Boufker, Hichame', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Najar, Mehdi', 'Piccart, Martine', 'Ghanem, Ghanem', 'Body, Jean-Jacques', 'Journe, Fabrice']","['Id Boufker H', 'Lagneaux L', 'Najar M', 'Piccart M', 'Ghanem G', 'Body JJ', 'Journe F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Experimentale, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100617,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Glycerophosphates)', '0 (IBSP protein, human)', '0 (Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'WWH06G87W6 (beta-glycerophosphoric acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Calcification, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dasatinib', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glycerophosphates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein', 'Kinetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoblasts/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Osteogenesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Osteopontin/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RANK Ligand/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2010/06/23 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2009/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-298 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-298 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Jun 17;10:298. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-298.,,,,PMC3087319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these differentiation processes deregulation of developmental genes may contribute to leukemogenesis. Here, we compared expression profiles of NK- and T-cell lines for identification of aberrantly expressed genes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) which physiologically regulate the differentiation program of the NK-cell lineage. RESULTS: This analysis showed high expression levels of HOXA9, HOXA10 and ID2 in NK-cell lines in addition to T-cell line LOUCY, suggesting leukemic deregulation therein. Overexpression experiments, chromatin immuno-precipitation and promoter analysis demonstrated that HOXA9 and HOXA10 directly activated expression of ID2. Concomitantly elevated expression levels of HOXA9 and HOXA10 together with ID2 in cell lines containing MLL translocations confirmed this form of regulation in both ALL and acute myeloid leukemia. Overexpression of HOXA9, HOXA10 or ID2 resulted in repressed expression of apoptosis factor BIM. Furthermore, profiling data of genes coding for chromatin regulators of homeobox genes, including components of polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), indicated lacking expression of EZH2 in LOUCY and exclusive expression of HOP in NK-cell lines. Subsequent treatment of T-cell lines JURKAT and LOUCY with DZNep, an inhibitor of EZH2/PRC2, resulted in elevated and unchanged HOXA9/10 expression levels, respectively. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 in JURKAT enhanced HOXA10 expression, confirming HOXA10-repression by EZH2. Additionally, profiling data and overexpression analysis indicated that reduced expression of E2F cofactor TFDP1 contributed to the lack of EZH2 in LOUCY. Forced expression of HOP in JURKAT cells resulted in reduced HOXA10 and ID2 expression levels, suggesting enhancement of PRC2 repression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that major differentiation factors of the NK-cell lineage, including HOXA9, HOXA10 and ID2, were (de)regulated via PRC2 which therefore contributes to T-cell leukemogenesis.","['Nagel, Stefan', 'Venturini, Letizia', 'Marquez, Victor E', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'MacLeod, Roderick Af', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Nagel S', 'Venturini L', 'Marquez VE', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Scherr M', 'MacLeod RA', 'Drexler HG']","['Dept. of Human and Animal Cell Lines, DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Inhoffenstr. 7B, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany. sna@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20100617,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (ID2 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",2010/06/23 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-151 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-151 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Jun 17;9:151. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-151.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2894765,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is a retrovirus that leads to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or myelopathies. This study aimed to evaluate HTLV-1 antibodies among renal transplant recipients in Urmia, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples of 91 renal transplant recipients from Urmia, Iran, were examined serologically for antibodies against HTLV type 1 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Mean age was 37.26 +/- 14.22 years old. Only 1 patient had a positive anti-HTLV-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, which was confirmed by Western blot. The HTLV-1-positive case did not have HTLV-associated clinical manifestation. This patient was a 45-year-old man, with no history of blood transfusion, but he did have a history of hemodialysis before transplant. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of HTLV-1 among renal transplant recipients of our region in the northwest of Iran was not so high, and it is similar to the HTLV- 1 seroprevalence among hemodialysis patients. Still, it is more frequent among healthy blood donors as representative of the general population in our region.","['Khameneh, Zakieh Rostamzadeh', 'Sepehrvand, Nariman', 'Masudi, Sima', 'Taghizade-Afshari, Ali']","['Khameneh ZR', 'Sepehrvand N', 'Masudi S', 'Taghizade-Afshari A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Umria University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', '*Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/23 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2010 Jun;8(2):146-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The safety and efficacy of imatinib in CML patients with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction has not been analyzed. METHODS: The authors analyzed the outcome of 259 patients with early chronic phase CML treated with imatinib (starting dose 400 mg in 50, 800 mg in 209). Pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction was seen in 38 (15%) and 11 (4%) patients, respectively. RESULTS: Dose reductions were required in 91 (43%) of 210 patients with normal organ function, compared with 8 (73%) of 11 (P = .065) with renal dysfunction, and 19 (50%) of 38 (P = .271) with liver dysfunction. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities including anemia (29%, 10%, and 7% of patients with renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and normal organ function, respectively), neutropenia (57%, 30%, and 30%), and thrombocytopenia (43%, 30%, and 26%) were more frequent in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction treated with high-dose imatinib. Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities were observed at similar frequencies. Complete cytogenetic response rates, event-free survival, and overall survival were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction might have a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and require more frequent dose reductions, most patients can be adequately managed, resulting in response rates and survival similar to those without pre-existing organ dysfunction.","['Tong, Wei-Gang', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Tong WG', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Shan J', 'Pierce S', 'Rios MB', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

However, to the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have examined cancer occurrence in children of mixed ancestry. METHODS: This population-based case-control study examined cancer among children aged <15 years using linked cancer and birth registry data from 5 US states from 1978 through 2004. Data were available for 13,249 cancer cases and 36,996 controls selected from birth records. Parental race/ethnicity was determined from birth records. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of cancer with different racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: Compared with whites, blacks had a 28% decreased risk of cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.65-0.80), whereas both Asians and Hispanics had an approximate 15% decrease. Children of mixed white/black ancestry also were found to be at decreased risk (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.90), but estimates for mixed white/Asian and white/Hispanic children did not differ from those of whites. Compared with whites: 1) black and mixed white/black children had decreased ORs for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.31-0.49] and OR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.37-0.91], respectively); 2) Asian and mixed white/Asian children had decreased ORs for brain tumors (OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.39-0.68] and OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.54-1.16], respectively); and 3) Hispanic and mixed white/Hispanic children had decreased ORs for neuroblastoma (OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.42-0.61] and OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.50-0.90], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Children of mixed ancestry tend to have disease risks that are more similar to those of racial/ethnic minority children than the white majority group.

A retrospective study was performed of efficacy and toxicity associated with GO therapy, and factors potentially predictive of response were assessed in 49 previously untreated AML patients. RESULTS: CR was achieved in 14% of all treated patients. Among the patients with an intermediate-risk karyotype, the CR rate was 30%, compared with none with an unfavorable karyotype. The median duration of overall survival was 3.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.4-6.9 months), and the median recurrence-free survival in patients who achieved CR was 11.8 months (95% CI, 5.0-ind months).

The inhibition of the TGFbeta1 cascade suppresses EMT and the resultant fibrosis. In this study, we focus on EMT-induced fibrosis in hepatocytes and the epigenetic regulation of the type I collagen gene. Histone acetylation is an important, major epigenetic mechanism that modulates gene transcription. We evaluated the epigenetic regulation of type I collagen in alpha mouse liver 12 hepatocytes (an untransformed mouse cell line) that had undergone EMT after treatment with TGFbeta1. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) inhibited EMT; this was reflected by the preservation of epithelial markers and function (E-cadherin and albumin). Fibrosis, the ultimate outcome of EMT, was abolished by TSA; this was indicated by the inhibition of type I collagen deposition. TSA exerted its anti-EMT effects by deactivating the mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3)/Smad4 transcription complex and by interfering with p300, a coactivator of the type I collagen promoter, and preventing its binding to Smad3. TSA also restored Friend leukemia virus integration 1, an inhibitor of the type I collagen gene. TGFbeta1-induced EMT and its inhibition by TSA were replicated in human primary hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Histone deacetylase inhibition abrogates TGFbeta1-induced EMT in hepatocytes and reverses EMT-induced fibrosis by epigenetic modulation of type I collagen.","['Kaimori, Aki', 'Potter, James J', 'Choti, Michael', 'Ding, Zhen', 'Mezey, Esteban', 'Koteish, Ayman A']","['Kaimori A', 'Potter JJ', 'Choti M', 'Ding Z', 'Mezey E', 'Koteish AA']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesoderm/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*pharmacology']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.23765 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2010 Sep;52(3):1033-45. doi: 10.1002/hep.23765.,,,['AA000626/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these proteins, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), is a major mediator of inflammation that is able to induce expression of several cytokines. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an inflammatory cytokine that is induced and plays a fundamental role during post-lactational involution of the mammary gland. Therefore, our goal was to determine whether TNFalpha activity in the mammary epithelium might include regulation of LIF expression. This biological role would increase the significance of TNFalpha expression at the end of lactation. Our results show that TNFalpha was able to induce LIF transcription through ERK1/2 activation in a non-tumorigenic mouse mammary epithelial cell line, SCp2. We found that activation of TNFalpha receptor-2 (TNFR2) was specifically involved in triggering this signaling pathway. In addition, our data suggest the participation of AP-1 transcription factor family members in this pathway. We determined that TNFalpha treatment induced c-fos transcription, and blocking AP-1 activity resulted in a significant inhibition of TNFalpha-induced LIF expression. Finally, we found that TNFalpha was also able to trigger LIF expression and ERK1/2 activation in the mouse mammary gland in vivo. Therefore, our data suggest that TNFalpha may contribute to mammary gland involution by, among other activities, eliciting LIF expression through ERK1/2 and AP1 activation.","['Levy, Carolina Schere', 'Slomiansky, Victoria', 'Gattelli, Albana', 'Nahmod, Karen', 'Pelisch, Federico', 'Blaustein, Matias', 'Srebrow, Anabella', 'Coso, Omar A', 'Kordon, Edith C']","['Levy CS', 'Slomiansky V', 'Gattelli A', 'Nahmod K', 'Pelisch F', 'Blaustein M', 'Srebrow A', 'Coso OA', 'Kordon EC']","['IFIBYNE-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, UBA (1428), Buenos Aires, Argentina. caschere@fibertel.com.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Human/cytology/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22595 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Jul 1;110(4):857-65. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22595.,,,['R01TW006212/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,"['J.

To determine whether increased phosphorylation of the PTPROt substrates following PTPROt suppression alters signal transduction pathway(s) that impart a growth advantage to the leukemic lymphocytes, it is critical to discern the key substrates of PTPROt. Here, we used substrate-trapping assay to identify two novel substrates of PTPROt, the tyrosine kinases Lyn and ZAP70. Both Lyn and ZAP70 were dephosphorylated by wild-type PTPROt, but not by its catalytic site (CS) mutant. A critical phosphorylation site in Lyn, Y397, essential for its activity was dephosphorylated by PTPROt. Consequently, the activity of Lyn kinase was compromised when co-expressed with PTPROt-WT compared to vector control or upon co-expression with PTPROt-CS. Ectopic expression of PTPROt in Raji cells reduced phosphorylation of Lyn in the absence of any change in its protein levels. These results have revealed the physiological importance of PTPROt in regulating B-cell receptor signaling at Lyn kinase. Further, ectopic expression of PTPROt also sensitized the cells to the VEGF-R inhibitor Pazopanib.","['Motiwala, Tasneem', 'Datta, Jharna', 'Kutay, Huban', 'Roy, Satavisha', 'Jacob, Samson T']","['Motiwala T', 'Datta J', 'Kutay H', 'Roy S', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '7RN5DR86CK (pazopanib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Indazoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22593 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Jul 1;110(4):846-56. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22593.,,,"['R01 CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086978-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2895018,"['J.

The objective of the current study was to identify the incidence, predictors, and outcome for AKI in patients with AML and HR-MDS. METHODS: : Data were analyzed from 537 patients with AML or HR-MDS undergoing induction chemotherapy from 1999 to 2007. Predictors for AKI were identified by logistic regression. Eight-week mortality of patients was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by the RIFLE criteria, a novel multilevel classification system for AKI based on the percent rise in serum creatinine from baseline (Risk, >50%; Injury, >100%; and Failure, >200% or requiring dialysis). RESULTS: : A total of 187 patients (36%) developed AKI. Significant independent risk factors for AKI included the following: age >/=55 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.8), mechanical ventilation (OR, 16), use of vancomycin (OR, 2.3), diuretics (OR, 3.0), amphotericin B lipid formulation (OR, 2.7), vasopressors (OR, 4.9), leukopenia (OR, 1.9), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.4), and use of non-fludarabine-based chemotherapy (OR, 2.7). The 8-week mortality rates were 3.8%, 13.6%, 19.6%, and 61.7% for the non-RIFLE, Risk, Injury, and Failure categories, respectively. Patients requiring dialysis (8%) had a median survival of 33 days. Survival of patients who achieved complete remission was favorable, regardless of degree of AKI. CONCLUSIONS: : The RIFLE classification for AKI appears to have prognostic utility in predicting mortality in patients with AML or HR-MDS. Relatively mild elevations in creatinine are associated with higher mortality. Strategies to avoid nephrotoxic drugs or fluid overload may be of benefit. Cancer 2010.

METHODS: The annual incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and MM was estimated in the United States in people aged <70 years by race and sex using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry between 1997 and 2002 and US census reports for the year 2000. The annual incidence of autologous, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling, and unrelated HCT performed in these groups was estimated using Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research data from 1997 through 2002. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of receiving HCT for Caucasians versus African Americans and for men versus women. RESULTS: The likelihood of undergoing HCT was found to be higher for Caucasians than for African Americans (OR, 1.40; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.34-1.46). This difference existed for each type of HCT: autologous (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.19-1.30), HLA identical sibling (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.46-1.74), and unrelated donor (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.75-2.33). Overall, men were more likely than women to receive HCT (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.1 [P<.0001]); however, this difference was found to be significant only for autologous HCT (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13 [P<.0001]). CONCLUSIONS: HCT is more frequently used to treat leukemia, lymphoma, and MM in Caucasians than in African American individuals. African Americans have lower rates of both autologous and allogeneic HCT, indicating that donor availability cannot fully explain the differences. Women are less likely than men to receive autologous HCT for reasons unexplained by age or disease status.","['Joshua, Thomas V', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Hari, Parameswaran N', 'Kurian, Seira', 'Pasquini, Marcelo', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Horowitz, Mary M']","['Joshua TV', 'Rizzo JD', 'Zhang MJ', 'Hari PN', 'Kurian S', 'Pasquini M', 'Majhail NS', 'Lee SJ', 'Horowitz MM']","['Center for Nursing Research, School of Nursing, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912, USA. tjoshua@mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/ethnology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/ethnology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', '*Racial Groups', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'United States', 'Whites']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25297 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;116(14):3469-76. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25297.,,,"['5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSH234200637015C/PHS HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3153958,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS311623'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of children with ALL who had a PORT insertion between January 2005 and August 2008. Early (</= 30 days) and late (>30 days) postprocedure complications were reviewed. The length of follow-up ranged between 7 months and 42 months. RESULTS: In total, 192 PORTs were inserted in 179 children. There were 43 CAIs (22%), and the infection rate was 0.35 per 1000 catheter-days. The CAI rate (15%) in children who had severe neutropenia on the day of the procedure did not differ statistically from the CAI rate (24%) in children who did not have severe neutropenia (P = .137). Conversely, patients with severe neutropenia who had a CAI were more likely to have their PORT removed (P = .019). The most common organisms to cause catheter removal were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with high-risk ALL had a statistically significant higher incidence of late CAI than patients with standard-risk ALL (P = .012). Age (P = .272), positive blood culture preprocedure (P = 1.0), and dexamethasone use (P = .201) were not risk factors for CAI. Patients who had an early CAI did not have a greater chance of having a late CAI. The catheter infection-free survival rate at 1 year was 88.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that severe neutropenia on the day of PORT insertion does not increase the risk of CAI in children with ALL.","['Junqueira, Beatriz L P', 'Connolly, Bairbre', 'Abla, Oussama', 'Tomlinson, George', 'Amaral, Joao G']","['Junqueira BL', 'Connolly B', 'Abla O', 'Tomlinson G', 'Amaral JG']","['Department of Diagnostic Imaging-Image Guided Therapy Center, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. beatriz.lp.junqueira@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Catheter-Related Infections/*epidemiology', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25286 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Sep 15;116(18):4368-75. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25286.,,,,,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Statistical analyses used included descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meir survival analysis, and recursive partitioning. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were identified between August 1992 and May 2007, including 37 (41.6%) males and 52 (58.4%) females with a median age of 50 years (range, 22-82 years). All but 6 patients had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean, Latin America, or Africa. The acute subtype predominated (68.5%). The majority of patients received a combination-alkylator-based chemotherapy regimen in the front-line setting (72.6%). The most common regimen was cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone at standard doses or attenuated and/or with methotrexate (CHOP-like), which produced an overall response rate of 64.1%. Despite initial responses to therapy, the median overall survival for all subtypes was 24 weeks (range, 0.9-315 weeks). Although the International Prognostic Index and Prognostic Index for peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified identified subsets of patients, these models were not completely predictive. A recursive partitioning analysis was performed on the data, which successfully identified 3 prognostic categories based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage, age, and calcium level at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This series proposed a new prognostic model for patients with HTLV-1-associated ATLL and confirmed a poor outcome for these patients in North America.","['Phillips, Adrienne A', 'Shapira, Iuliana', 'Willim, Robert D', 'Sanmugarajah, Jasotha', 'Solomon, William B', 'Horwitz, Steven M', 'Savage, David G', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Soff, Gerald', 'Zain, Jasmine M', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Seshan, Venkatraman E', ""O'Connor, Owen A""]","['Phillips AA', 'Shapira I', 'Willim RD', 'Sanmugarajah J', 'Solomon WB', 'Horwitz SM', 'Savage DG', 'Bhagat G', 'Soff G', 'Zain JM', 'Alobeid B', 'Seshan VE', ""O'Connor OA""]","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Milstein Hospital Building, New York, New York 10032, USA. ap2027@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'United States']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25147 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;116(14):3438-46. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25147.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to compare the various potential therapeutic options for patients who achieved first complete remission. METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, including patients with standard-risk (SR) All and high-risk (HR) ALL who received first postremission therapy. Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality (ACM), disease recurrence (relapse), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and pooled. RESULTS: Overall, there was a significant reduction in ACM in the allogenic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) arm (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.8-0.97) compared with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses revealed a similar pattern among SR patients (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.68-0.94) but a nonsignificant advantage for alloSCT among HR patients (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.01). There was an increase in NRM (RR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.37-6.53) and a decrease in the relapse rate in the alloSCT arm (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.83). There was no difference in ACM or the relapse rate between the ASCT and chemotherapy arms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, alloSCT was superior to ASCT or chemotherapy for patients with ALL in first complete remission.

In the current report, the results for patients with CML in blast phase after 2 years of follow-up are reported. METHODS: Patients were stratified according to whether they had CML in myeloid blast phase (MBP-CML) or in lymphoid blast phase (LBP-CML) and were randomized (1:1) within each stratum to receive either oral dasatinib 140 mg once daily or 70 mg twice daily. RESULTS: In patients with MBP-CML, the major hematologic response rate was 28% for both regimens; and, in patients with LBP-CML, the major hematologic response rate was 42% for once-daily dasatinib and 32% for twice-daily dasatinib. The major cytogenetic response rates were 25% for once-daily dasatinib and 28% for twice-daily dasatinib in patients with MBP-CML, and the respective rates in patients with LBP-CML were 50% and 40%. The overall survival rate at 24 months was 24% for once-daily dasatinib and 28% for twice-daily dasatinib in patients with MBP-CML, and the respective values in patients with LBP-CML were 21% and 16%. Adverse events indicated a trend toward improved tolerability for the once-daily regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that dasatinib 140 mg once daily had similar efficacy and improved tolerability relative to the 70-mg twice-daily regimen in patients with imatinib-resistant, blast phase CML.","['Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Goh, Yeow Tee', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Maloisel, Frederic', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Paquette, Ronald', 'Bradley-Garelik, M Brigid', 'Zhu, Chao', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Saglio G', 'Hochhaus A', 'Goh YT', 'Masszi T', 'Pasquini R', 'Maloisel F', 'Erben P', 'Cortes J', 'Paquette R', 'Bradley-Garelik MB', 'Zhu C', 'Dombret H']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. giuseppe.saglio@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/10/19 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25123 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Aug 15;116(16):3852-61. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25123.,,,['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4993589,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,['NIHMS810003'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['DISCLOSURES Dr. Masszi, Dr. Erben, and Dr. Dombret declared no competing', 'interests.']",

The future of ALL management relies on the introduction of novel targeted therapies. The authors sought to assess if protein kinases (PKs), frequently deregulated in cancer, show an altered expression pattern and can be considered as suitable therapeutic targets in adult ALL. METHODS: The authors studied the PK gene expression profile by oligonucleotide arrays in 133 adult ALL samples at the onset of the disease and subsequently performed in vitro experiments to evaluate the sensitivity to first- and second-generation PK inhibitors of a set of ALL cell lines, as well as of primary ALL cells. RESULTS: The study documents a distinctive PK signature for different adult ALL subgroups; the PKs identified include several tyrosine kinase (TK) genes, especially in E2A/PBX+ B-lineage ALL (B-ALL), B-ALL without known molecular abnormalities, and T-lineage ALL. Consistently, cell lines and primary samples belonging to these groups proved susceptible to TK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that second-generation TK inhibitors may be effective in ALL subsets other than BCR/ABL+B-ALL and provide the rationale for testing the impact of the newly developed TK inhibitors in the management of adult ALL patients.","['Messina, Monica', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Sica, Simona', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Messina M', 'Chiaretti S', 'Tavolaro S', 'Peragine N', 'Vitale A', 'Elia L', 'Sica S', 'Levis A', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25113 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;116(14):3426-37. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25113.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many imatinib-resistant mutations respond well to second-generation TKIs, the threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315 of the breakpoint cluster region/v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene protein fusion Bcr-Abl (T315I) is insensitive to all currently available TKIs. The outcome in such patients after stem cell transplantation (SCT) is unknown. METHODS: Eight patients with TKI-resistant CML who had T315I mutations underwent 9 transplantations. At the time of SCT, 2 patients were in chronic phase, 3 patients were in accelerated phase; and 3 patients were in second chronic phase. RESULTS: The best responses after SCT were a complete molecular response (CMR) in 3 patients, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) in 4 patients, and a complete hematologic response (CHR) in 1 patient, and 1 patient had no response. The best outcome was for patients who underwent transplantation in chronic phase, and both of those patients remained alive and in complete molecular remission 14 months and 42 months after SCT. After a median follow-up of 13 months from SCT, 5 patients remained alive, including 3 patients in CMR, 1 patient in CCyR, and 1 patient in CHR.

The authors investigated quality of care and clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who were hospitalized on weekends versus weekdays and treated with induction chemotherapy. METHODS: This retrospective follow-up study involved 422 AML patients treated with cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy at Cleveland Clinic from 1994-2008. Quality outcome measures included time to triple-lumen catheter (TLC) placement, time to induction chemotherapy, length of stay (LOS), early death (within 15 days of chemotherapy), and 30-day mortality. These were tested for the association with known predictors of AML survival and etiology by the methods of linear, categorical, and survival analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of all admissions (n=422) occurred over the weekend (n=103). Compared with younger (aged<60 years) patients, older patients had higher 30-day mortality (P=.003), early death (P=.025), and time to induction rates (P=.02), but lower complete remission (P=.001) and overall survival (OS) rates (P<.0001). In univariate analyses, time to TLC was delayed for weekend admissions (P<.01). Weekend admissions had lower early mortality (P=.04) and 30-day mortality (P=.02). In multivariate analysis, only time to TLC remained significantly longer for weekend admissions (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Weekend admissions significantly delayed placement of TLC without affecting other quality parameters or patient survival. This is likely because of immediate initiation of peripheral chemotherapy with cytarabine even before the placement of TLC for infusion of anthracyclines.","['Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Fu, Alex Z', 'Lazaryan, Aleksandr', 'Fu, Rao', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Bejanyan N', 'Fu AZ', 'Lazaryan A', 'Fu R', 'Kalaycio M', 'Advani A', 'Sobecks R', 'Copelan E', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Sekeres MA']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Catheterization', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Admission', '*Quality of Health Care', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25086 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Aug 1;116(15):3614-20. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25086.,,,['IH U54RR19397-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright (c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using probabilistic computational modeling of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, verified by single-cell experimental observations, we develop a model of Bcl-2 inhibition of apoptosis. Our results clarify how Bcl-2 imparts its anti-apoptotic role by increasing the time-to-death and cell-to-cell variability. We also show that although the commitment to death is highly impacted by differences in protein levels at the time of stimulation, inherent stochastic fluctuations in apoptotic signaling are sufficient to induce cell-to-cell variability and to allow single cells to escape death. This study suggests that intrinsic cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic signaling is sufficient to cause fractional killing of cancer cells after exposure to BH3 mimetics.

In this study, the PTTH gene promoter of Bombyx mori (Bom-PTTH) was cloned and sequenced. The cis-regulatory elements in Bom-PTTH gene promoter were predicted using Matinspector software, including myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1, TATA box, etc. Transient transfection assays using a series of fragments linked to the luciferase reporter gene indicated that the fragment spanning -110 to +33 bp of the Bom-PTTH promoter showed high ability to support reporter gene expression, but the region of +34 to +192 bp and -512 to -111 bp repressed the promoter activity in the BmN and Bm5 cell lines.

METHODS: The cytotoxicity of SM on cancer cells was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2 and 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell membrane integrity was assessed by detecting the leakage of cytoplasmic content, the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the uptake of propidium iodide (PI). We use whole-cell recording to measure the time courses of membrane blebbing and disruption in human K562 leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma KB cells. The effects of SM on cytoskeletal systems were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of SM did not correlate with the expression level of the multidrug resistance MDR1 and was triggered rapidly by 10 muM SM (5 min caused 50% maximum cytotoxicity). Its rapid ability to make propidium iodide (PI) permeate into tumor cells, LDH release, and leakage of cytoplasmic content at the same rate (within minutes), suggests a killing mechanism that involves plasma membrane perturbation. SM induced membrane blebbing within 5 min of sustained application. Both chelating extracellular calcium with EGTA and clamping intracellular calcium concentrations with a high concentration of the cell-permeable chelator BAPTA-AM did not prevent blebbing. Polyethylene glycols having molecular weights >/=3,350 blocked membrane blebbing. SM also disrupted the cytoskeletal systems: degradation of microtubules and actin proteins.

Both drugs function as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and lead to the reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes. However, not much is known about their target sequence specificity and their possible side effects on normally methylated sequences such as long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1 retroelements. It has been shown that demethylation and activation of the LINE-1 antisense promoter can drive the transcription of neighbouring sequences. In this study, we show that demethylation of the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116, either by treatment with DNMT inhibitors or by genetic disruption of the major DNMTs, induces the expression of an illegitimate fusion transcript between an intronic LINE-1 element and the proto-oncogene cMet (L1-cMet). Similar findings were also obtained with myeloid leukaemia cells, an established cellular model for the approved indication of azacytidine and decitabine. Interestingly, upregulation of L1-cMet transcription resulted in reduced cMet expression, which in turn led to decreased cMet receptor signalling. Our results thus provide an important paradigm for demethylation-dependent modulation of gene expression, even if the promoter of the corresponding gene is unmethylated.","['Weber, B', 'Kimhi, S', 'Howard, G', 'Eden, A', 'Lyko, F']","['Weber B', 'Kimhi S', 'Howard G', 'Eden A', 'Lyko F']","['Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100621,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antisense Elements (Genetics)/drug effects/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Genetic Loci', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/drug effects/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Transfection']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010227 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.227 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Oct 28;29(43):5775-84. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.227.

Such precisely tailored compounds would serve as molecular probes and targeted therapies to study and treat human diseases driven by specific anti-apoptotic blockades. In particular, MCL-1 has emerged as a major resistance factor in human cancer. By screening a library of stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains (SAHBs), we determined that the MCL-1 BH3 helix is itself a potent and exclusive MCL-1 inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis studies defined key binding and specificity determinants, including the capacity to harness the hydrocarbon staple to optimize affinity while preserving selectivity. MCL-1 SAHB directly targets MCL-1, neutralizes its inhibitory interaction with pro-apoptotic BAK and sensitizes cancer cells to caspase-dependent apoptosis. By leveraging nature's solution to ligand selectivity, we generated an MCL-1-specific agent that defines the structural and functional features of targeted MCL-1 inhibition.","['Stewart, Michelle L', 'Fire, Emiko', 'Keating, Amy E', 'Walensky, Loren D']","['Stewart ML', 'Fire E', 'Keating AE', 'Walensky LD']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100620,United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism/physiology']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/08/04 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['nchembio.391 [pii]', '10.1038/nchembio.391 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2010 Aug;6(8):595-601. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.391.

Translocations associated with this syndrome result in the fusion of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR 1) gene with various partners, resulting in ligand-independent FGFR activity. To date, 8 partner genes have been identified in association with FGFR1 rearrangements. The most frequent FGFR1 translocation partner is the zinc finger gene ZNF198 located at 13q11. Disease phenotypes associated with this translocation include poor prognosis and transformation to acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In common with a T-cell phenotype, obtaining and maintaining remission is difficult by conventional chemotherapy. This study describes an illustrative case of 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome/stem cell leukemia/lymphoma outlining its chief features and historical developments.","['Chen, Xiangli', 'Zhang, Yin', 'Li, Yulong', 'Lei, Pingchong', 'Zhai, Yaping', 'Liu, Linxiang']","['Chen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Lei P', 'Zhai Y', 'Liu L']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, First Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CVAD protocol', 'EPOCH protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/congenital/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precancerous Conditions/congenital/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Syndrome', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e413fa [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 Aug;32(6):501-3. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181e413fa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A linked database of the Florida cancer registry and State inpatient and outpatient hospital data for 1998-2002 was queried. Effects of demographic and treatment characteristics on survival were explored using univariate and multivariate analyses methods. RESULTS: A total of 4659 patients with AML were identified. Over 50% of patients with AML were 70 years of age or older. African American (AA) patients were diagnosed at significantly younger ages than were whites (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of worse survival in AML were aged over 50 (hazard ratios [HRs]: 1.60, 2.15, 3.04, and 3.62 over the decade-cohorts, all P < 0.001), AA race (HR: 1.27, P < 0.001), being a former or current user of tobacco (HR: 1.13, P = 0.004 and HR: 1.28, P < 0.001, respectively), residing in an area with the highest poverty level (HR: 1.15, P = 0.007), and being covered only by Medicaid (HR: 1.23, P = 0.014). No differences in outcomes were observed related to gender or ethnicity. Receipt of chemotherapy was strongly associated with improved survival (HR: 0.59, P < 0.001). When only those patients who received and appeared to respond to treatment are included, AAs continued to demonstrate a worse outcome than Whites. CONCLUSIONS: AML disproportionately affects the elderly. AA patients and patients from poorer communities with AML have significantly worse survival. Interventions to provide earlier diagnosis in these patients as well as to improve overall outcomes are needed to address these disparities.","['Byrne, Margaret M', 'Halman, L Jill', 'Koniaris, Leonidas G', 'Cassileth, Peter A', 'Rosenblatt, Joseph D', 'Cheung, Michael C']","['Byrne MM', 'Halman LJ', 'Koniaris LG', 'Cassileth PA', 'Rosenblatt JD', 'Cheung MC']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA. mbyrne2@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Florida/epidemiology', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*ethnology/mortality', 'Male', 'Medicaid', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Poverty', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2010/06/22 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/COC.0b013e3181dea934 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jun;34(3):297-304. doi: 10.1097/COC.0b013e3181dea934.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a descriptive, cross-sectional design, children aged 4-18 years receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ALL and their parents completed questionnaires about their sleep and fatigue. Sleep disturbance was common in both children (87%) and parents (48%) and sleep disturbance scores were positively correlated with fatigue scores. From qualitative written responses to open-ended questions, 9 themes emerged related to sleep for children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for ALL. Sleep differences noted since diagnosis included (1) sleep is disturbed, (2) sleep habits have changed, and (3) sleep is unchanged or improved. Things that got in the way of children sleeping well included (4) side effects of medication, especially dexamethasone; and (5) medication schedules. Things that helped children get sleep at night were (6) sleeping with someone, (7) comforting activities or routine, (8) medications, and (9) food and drink.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common herpes virus that elicits a strong virus-specific T-cell immune response after infection. We studied the CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell response in 45 patients and 35 control subjects and demonstrated that it was markedly expanded in the patient group, averaging 11% of the CD4(+) pool compared with 4.7% in controls. The magnitude of the CMV-specific CD4(+) immune response increased with disease stage and was particularly high in patients who received chemotherapy. Within this group, the CMV-specific response comprised over 46% of the CD4(+) T-cell repertoire in some patients. Serial analysis revealed that CMV-specific immunity increased during treatment with chemotherapy and remained stable thereafter. CMV-seropositive patients exhibited a markedly altered CD4(+) T-cell repertoire with increased numbers of CD45R0(+) T cells and a reduction in CD27, CD28, and CCR7 expression. Overall survival was reduced by nearly 4 years in CMV-seropositive patients, although this did not reach statistical significance. CLL patients therefore demonstrate an expansion of the CD4(+) CMV-specific immune response, which is likely to contribute to the immunological and clinical features of this disease.","['Pourgheysari, Batoul', 'Bruton, Rachel', 'Parry, Helen', 'Billingham, Lucinda', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Murray, Jim', 'Moss, Paul']","['Pourgheysari B', 'Bruton R', 'Parry H', 'Billingham L', 'Fegan C', 'Murray J', 'Moss P']","['School for Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (CD3 Complex)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Cell Count', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy/*immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31224-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-257147 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Oct 21;116(16):2968-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-257147.

MK was found in 176 (13%) patients. The proportion of patients with MK increased with age, being present in 4% of patients age 30 or younger, but in 20% of those over age 60. Ninety-eight percent of MK cases were within the unfavorable cytogenetic risk category and comprised 40% of this group. The complete remission rate in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics without MK was 34% versus 18% with MK (P < .01). The 4-year overall survival of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics but without MK was 13% in contrast to a 4-year survival of only 3% with MK (P < .01).

We now demonstrate that B-cell progenitors, up to and including the pro-B cell, efficiently initiate Ph(+) B-ALL. However, cells at the pre-B-cell stage of development did not initiate disease. We show that this difference in leukemia initiating potential is due to the level at which the Arf tumor suppressor gene is induced in specific stages of B lymphopoiesis. Whereas immature B-cell progenitors survive the relatively low levels of Arf that are induced after oncogene expression, pre-B cells express the tumor suppressor gene at high levels and undergo massive apoptosis.

Imatinib mesylate, a platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor, induces thrombocytopenia in a significant proportion of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Although our previous studies showed that platelet-derived growth factor enhances megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro, the in vivo effect of platelet-derived growth factor in a model of radiation-induced thrombocytopenia has not been reported. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of platelet-derived growth factor on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and platelet production using an irradiated-mouse model. We also explored the potential molecular mechanisms of platelet-derived growth factor on thrombopoiesis in M-07e cells. RESULTS: Platelet-derived growth factor, like thrombopoietin, significantly promoted the recovery of platelets and the formation of bone marrow colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte in irradiated mice. Histology confirmed the protective effect of platelet-derived growth factor, as shown by an increased number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and a reduction of apoptosis. In a megakaryocytic apoptotic model, platelet-derived growth factor had a similar anti-apoptotic effect as thrombopoietin on megakaryocytes. We also demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor activated the PI3-k/Akt signaling pathway, while addition of imatinib mesylate reduced p-Akt expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that platelet-derived growth factor enhances platelet recovery in mice with radiation-induced thrombocytopenia. This radioprotective effect is likely to be mediated via platelet-derived growth factor receptors with subsequent activation of the PI3-k/Akt pathway. We also provide a possible explanation that blockage of platelet-derived growth factor receptors may reduce thrombopoiesis and play a role in imatinib mesylate-induced thrombocytopenia.","['Ye, Jie Yu', 'Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung', 'Qiao, Liang', 'Lian, Qizhou', 'Meng, Fan Yi', 'Luo, Xue Qun', 'Khachigian, Levon M', 'Ma, Ming', 'Deng, Ruixia', 'Chen, Jian Liang', 'Chong, Beng H', 'Yang, Mo']","['Ye JY', 'Chan GC', 'Qiao L', 'Lian Q', 'Meng FY', 'Luo XQ', 'Khachigian LM', 'Ma M', 'Deng R', 'Chen JL', 'Chong BH', 'Yang M']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100618,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2010/06/22 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.020958 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.020958 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Oct;95(10):1745-53. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.020958.

Sepsis which is hard to be diagnosed causes high death rate. This study was purposed to establish an experimental sepsis mouse model so as to provide a basis for pathogenesis and intervention study. A classic caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to establish experimental sepsis model. ELISA was used to detect levels of C5a, IL-6, TNFalpha, and IFN-gamma. Flow Cytometry was applied to measure apoptosis of lymphocytes in thymus and mesentery. The pathologic changes of thymus and spleen were confirmed by HE staining. The results showed that almost 70%-80% mice died at 72 hours after CLP. Only approximate 20% animal survived during finite time, mice in CLP group had significant weight lose. Meanwhile large release of different inflammatory mediators which are related with sepsis (C5a, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) was observed after CLP. Apoptosis of lymphocytes in thymus and mesentery lymphonodus was enhanced markedly after CLP. Significantly pathologic injury was also observed in thymus and spleen.

Standard curves of U6 and miRNA were constructed from 10-fold serial dilutions of the cDNA, the quantitative detection was performed by using real-time quantitative PCR with SYBR Green by Roche Light Cycler. U6 RNA was used as the reference, the relative expression levels of miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-29b, miR-181a and miR-181b in patients with CLL, while miR-128-1, miR-223, let-7b, miR-155 and miR-181a in patients with AL were analyzed by 2((-DeltaDeltaCT)) method. The relative parameters including specificity, linearity range, sensitivity and repeatability were evaluated. The results showed that the RQ-PCR assay could precisely detect the mature miRNA in as few as 10-50 ng of total RNA with the sensitivity of 0.05 ng RNA. Ct values of miRNA and U6 were all within 15 to 30. A good linear relationship (R(2) > 0.980) was obtained from the standard curves, also the efficiency of amplification was above 90%. Only a specific peak was shown on the melting curve diagram. The coefficients of variation (CV) of interrun and intrarun assay was < 4.8% and 6.3% respectively.

A 21nt siRNA targeting at the fusion site of b3:a2 mRNA in bcr-abl fusion gene was designed, synthesized and transfected into the K562 cells as RNA interference group. Northern blot was used to detect the bcr-abl fusion gene, Western blot was used to detect the expression of P210 protein and apoptosis-related protein BCL-xL after the transfection. Meanwhile, p27 gene was amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RT-PCR, and was confirmed to be correct by sequencing, then p27-pcDNA3.1 vector was constructed and transfected into K562 cell line by Lipofectin. After being selected with G418, p27-pcDNA3.1-K562 cell clone stably expressing p27 was isolated. P27 protein was identified by Western blot. Finally, siRNA and p27 gene clone were together applied to K562 cells, the cell survival rate was tested by MTT. The cell cycle and the apoptosis were tested by flow cytometry. The result showed that in contrast with the control group, the expression level of bcr-abl fusion gene was much lower in siRNA group, about 18.4% of K562 cells in siRNA group were apoptotic at 24 hours after siRNA transfection, and the expression of apoptosis-associated protein BCL-xL was greatly down-regulated.

The methylation status of histone H3K4, H3K9 and the expression of P15 protein in the Molt-4 cells treated with PHI were detected by Western blot; the methylation status of p15 gene in the Molt-4 cells before and after treatment with PHI was determined by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP); the expression level of p15 gene mRNA in Molt-4 cells treated with PHI was assayed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The results indicated that the PHI could increase methylation of histone H3K4 and decrease methylation of histone H3K9 in concentration-and time-dependent manners.

It is concluded that the AsnS plays a critical role in regulating cellular biological behavior after depletion of asparagine, the AsnS mRNA expression level in cells reflects the sensitivity of cells to L-Asp. The results may imply the possibility for the use of L-asparaginase in leukemia with lower AsnS expression level.","['Li, Ben-Shang', 'He, Ying-Yi', 'Luo, Chang-Ying', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Shen, Shu-Hong', 'Jiang, Li-Min', 'Zhang, Bei', 'Gu, Long-Jun']","['Li BS', 'He YY', 'Luo CY', 'Jiang H', 'Shen SH', 'Jiang LM', 'Zhang B', 'Gu LJ']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology']",2010/06/22 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)03-0559-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Jun;18(3):559-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high density tiling arrays (chip), also known as ChIP-chip, was utilized in this study. ChIP-DNA enriched by an anti-ETO antibody and total genomic DNA of Kasumi cells were hybridized to tiling arrays, tiled through chromosome 2, 9 and 19. The ChIP enriched regions were identified using a model based analytical tool (MAT). Genomic distribution of the ChIP regions was analyzed using publicly available CEAS web server. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to excavated the biological significance. The results indicated that a total of 588 enriched regions were identified on chromosome 2, 9 and 19 by the anti-ETO antibody. A number of the identified regions were located within enhancers (48.86%) or introns (37.35%), much smaller fractions were within proximal promoters (5.96%) or exons (5.49%). Functional enrichment analysis showed that cell proliferation and signal transduction biological pathways were enriched in potential genes of AML-ETO. It is concluded that half of the AML1-ETO binding sites are located within known transcriptional regulatory regions (promoter, 5' UTR and enhancer), while almost another half were within the sequences which were not previously reported as regulatory regions. The potential target molecular network of AML1-ETO is involved in several essential biological processes.","['He, Miao-Miao', 'Shi, Jian-Tao', 'Zhu, Xue-Hua', 'Jin, Wen', 'Wang, Ping', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Wagn, Kan-Kan']","['He MM', 'Shi JT', 'Zhu XH', 'Jin W', 'Wang P', 'Zhang J', 'Wagn KK']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2010/06/22 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2010)03-0553-06 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2010 Jun;18(3):553-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two cases of PLT transfusion refractoriness linked to anti-CD36. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 5-year-old female of Lebanese descent and a 70-year-old male of Chinese descent both failed to respond to HLA-matched PLT transfusions during acute myelogenous leukemia induction therapy. Antibody screening was performed using a PLT antibody solid-phase kit (PAKPLUS, GTI Diagnostics), followed by the monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of PLT antigen (MAIPA) test and, for the second case, the modified antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MACE). RESULTS: Both patients demonstrated antibody to GP IV (CD36) on the PAKPLUS assay. On MAIPA testing, both phenotyped as CD36 negative. Anti-CD36 was demonstrated by MAIPA in the first case. In the second case, antibodies were not detected by MAIPA and variably detectable by MACE, depending on the mouse monoclonal antibody (MoAb) used. Because no Canadian CD36-negative donors were available, antigen-negative plateletpheresis units from the BloodCenter of Wisconsin were successfully transfused. CONCLUSION: Two cases of clinically significant CD36 antibodies are reported. Investigation of one case was complicated by steric inhibition of binding in the MAIPA and MACE assays with certain MoAbs. The cases demonstrate the importance of maintaining an ethnically diverse pool of rare donors and the value of international cooperation in the management of these patients.","['Saw, Chee-Loong', 'Szykoluk, Helen', 'Curtis, Brian R', 'Zelcer, Shayna', 'Eckert, Kathleen', 'Forrest, Donna', 'Nickerson, Peter', 'Petraszko, Tanya', 'Goldman, Mindy']","['Saw CL', 'Szykoluk H', 'Curtis BR', 'Zelcer S', 'Eckert K', 'Forrest D', 'Nickerson P', 'Petraszko T', 'Goldman M']","['Platelet Immunology Laboratory, Canadian Blood Services, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, Human Platelet)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Human Platelet/immunology', 'CD36 Antigens/*immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/blood/*etiology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/adverse effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Male', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Treatment Failure']",2010/06/22 06:00,2011/01/21 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['TRF2749 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02749.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2010 Dec;50(12):2638-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02749.x.,,,,,['(c) 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status remains the 'gold standard' in molecular prognostication, a range of additional markers is increasingly being used in clinical trials. As awareness of trial data increases, requests to determine these prognostic markers for new CLL patients are becoming more prevalent in Australia. AIM: To explore the clinical utility of currently available prognostic markers for CLL in an Australian cohort. METHODS: IgVH mutational status and gene usage was determined and compared with other reported immunophenotypic markers, cytogenetics and clinical outcome as defined by treatment-free survival (TFS), lymphocyte doubling time and clinical stage in a cohort of 65 CLL patients. RESULTS: An unmutated IgVH gene, high expression of CD38, ZAP-70, CD25, CD49d, CD54 or low expression of CD49c was associated with shorter TFS indicating an adverse clinical prognosis in our cohort. High expression of each of CD38, ZAP-70, CD49d and CD54 was significantly associated with an unmutated IgVH gene; however, associations were not absolute. IgVH and CD25 expression retained their significance in multivariate analysis. Concordant CD25(high) /IgVH unmutated CLL patients had the shortest median TFS interval (40 months) in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular and immunophenotypic markers remain useful as adjuncts to clinical prognostication; however, as single parameters they are unable to dictate the timing of therapeutic intervention. The combined use of CD25 and IgVH mutational status may be clinically relevant to CLL prognostication while also providing insight into the biological pathways involved in disease progression.","['Sulda, M L', 'Kuss, B J', 'Hall, R K', 'Bailey, S', 'Macardle, P J']","['Sulda ML', 'Kuss BJ', 'Hall RK', 'Bailey S', 'Macardle PJ']","['Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders Medical Centre School of Biological Sciences, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100616,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/blood/genetics', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/physiology']",2010/06/22 06:00,2012/11/07 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IMJ2294 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1445-5994.2010.02294.x [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2012 Feb;42(2):137-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2010.02294.x.

The aim of the study was to enlarge the knowledge on these rarely occurring ALL. METHODS: The members of the European Group for Immunophenotyping of Leukemias (EGIL) searched retrospectively their databases for NT-ALL patients. RESULTS: We collected data of 36 European children from seven European countries with NT-ALL diagnosed since 1992. All patients reached complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Their blasts were negative for peroxidase and BCR-ABL1. Ten children were diagnosed as T-cell ALL (T-ALL) EGIL categories (T-I n=2, T-II n=2, T-III n=3, T-IV n=3) and four displayed various structural chromosomal abnormalities. Eight of 10 T-ALL remained in 1st CR; one died in CR from sepsis and one is alive in 2nd CR. Median survival was 88 (7-213) months. B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL was diagnosed in 26 children. Thirteen were positive for ETV6-RUNX1 and are alive in 1st CR for 32-147 months. Ten children were ETV6-RUNX1 negative and remained in 1st CR for 16-163 months. One girl with hypodiploid and NT metaphases and ETV6-RUNX1-negative BCP-ALL and one of two boys with NT-BCP-ALL not examined for ETV6-RUNX1 died of infection after stem cell transplantation in 2nd/3rd CR. Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome developed in two patients with NT-BCP-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular heterogeneity of NT-ALL and favorable prognosis of most NT-ALL across different immunophenotypic and/or genetic ALL subtypes.","['Lemez, Petr', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Castoldi, Gianluigi', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Garand, Richard', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Kagialis-Girard, Sandrine', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Pages, Marie-Pierre', 'Pickl, Winfried', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Schabath, Richard', 'Stary, Jan', 'Strobl, Herbert', 'Talmant, Pascaline', ""van't Veer, Mars B"", 'Zemanova, Zuzana']","['Lemez P', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Bene MC', 'Bertrand Y', 'Castoldi G', 'Forestier E', 'Garand R', 'Haas OA', 'Kagialis-Girard S', 'Ludwig WD', 'Matutes E', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Pages MP', 'Pickl W', 'Porwit A', 'Orfao A', 'Schabath R', 'Stary J', 'Strobl H', 'Talmant P', ""van't Veer MB"", 'Zemanova Z']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hospital Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic. plemez@post.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1493 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01493.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Oct;85(4):300-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01493.x.,,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,['European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the activity of ENMD-2076 against multiple myeloma (MM) cells in vitro and in vivo. ENMD-2076 showed significant cytotoxicity against MM cell lines and primary cells, with minimal cytotoxicity to haematopoietic progenitors. ENMD-2076 inhibited the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway and downregulated survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis as early as 6 h after treatment. With longer treatment (24-48 h), ENMD-2076 also inhibited aurora A and B kinases, and induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest. In non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice implanted with H929 human plasmacytoma xenografts, oral treatment with ENMD-2076 (50, 100, 200 mg/kg per day) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth. Immunohistochemical staining of excised tumours showed significant reduction in phospho-Histone 3 (pH3), Ki-67, and angiogenesis, and also a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 at all dose levels compared to tumours from vehicle-treated mice. In addition, a significant reduction in p-FGFR3 was observed on Western blot.

Accordingly, it was predicted that the concentration of ferritin in synovial fluid (SF) would be higher in OA patients with HFE gene mutations than in HFE wild-type (wt) OA patients. The aim of this study was to test this proposition. METHODS: Sequential patients with physician-diagnosed OA and, for comparison, diverse inflammatory diseases of the joints, who required diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis, were studied. Participants underwent HFE genotyping. SF samples were assayed for ferritin and also for selected cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with diverse rheumatic disorders were recruited. Of the 29 patients who had knee OA, 15 were wt and 14 were heterozygous for HFE mutations (C282Y or H63D). Mean SF ferritin concentrations in the wt and heterozygous OA groups were 273 and 655 ng/mL, respectively (p = 0.0146). CONCLUSIONS: A predicted difference in SF ferritin concentrations in patients with knee OA was confirmed. Concentrations of ferritin in the SF were found to be two- to threefold higher in knee OA patients with HFE gene mutations compared to wt patients. This finding is consistent with the possibility that, in OA patients with HFE gene mutations, localized iron overload may contribute either directly or indirectly to osteochondral damage, possibly in a similar way to that which occurs in the arthropathy that complicates HH.","['Carroll, G J', 'Sharma, G', 'Upadhyay, A', 'Jazayeri, J A']","['Carroll GJ', 'Sharma G', 'Upadhyay A', 'Jazayeri JA']","['University of Notre Dame and Department of Rheumatology, Fremantle Hospital, Australia. gjcarroll@optusnet.com.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Rheumatol,Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,0321213,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Heterozygote', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/blood', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/blood', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Synovial Fluid/*metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/blood']",2010/06/22 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/03009741003677449 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Rheumatol. 2010;39(5):413-20. doi: 10.3109/03009741003677449.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that EA is a potent apoptosis inducer and also effectively potentiates ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Hagiwara, Yuki', 'Kasukabe, Takashi', 'Kaneko, Yasuhiko', 'Niitsu, Nozomi', 'Okabe-Kado, Junko']","['Hagiwara Y', 'Kasukabe T', 'Kaneko Y', 'Niitsu N', 'Okabe-Kado J']","['Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, 818 Komuro, Ina-machi, Kitaadachi-gun, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100618,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '19YRN3ZS9P (Ellagic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ellagic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/12/25 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2009/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0627-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 Jul;92(1):136-43. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0627-4.

In most of the cancer cells tested, chrysin has shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis, and is more potent than other tested flavonoids in leukemia cells, where chrysin is likely to act via activation of caspases and inactivation of Akt signaling in the cells. Moreover, structure-activity relationships have revealed that the chemical structure of chrysin meets the key structural requirements of flavonoids for potent cytotoxicity in leukemia cells. It is possible that combination therapy or modified chrysin could be more potent than single-agent use or administration of unmodified chrysin. This study may help to develop ways of improving the effectiveness of chrysin in the treatment of leukemia and other human cancers in vitro.","['Khoo, Boon Yin', 'Chua, Siang Ling', 'Balaram, Prabha']","['Khoo BY', 'Chua SL', 'Balaram P']","['Institute for Research in Molecular Medicine (INFORMM), Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia; E-Mails: siang_ling85@yahoo.com (S.L.C.); prabha@kb.usm.my (P.B.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100519,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '3CN01F5ZJ5 (chrysin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/06/19 06:01,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3390/ijms11052188 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2010 May 19;11(5):2188-99. doi: 10.3390/ijms11052188.,,,,PMC2885101,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptotic effect', 'chrysin', 'human cancers', 'in vitro']",,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20110714'],,,,,,,,,,,,

H3K4 (histone H3 lysine 4) methylation by the SET domain of the trithorax-group protein MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) is important for the control of homeobox (HOX) gene expression during development. MLL is tethered to the HOXA locus through interaction of its amino-terminus with menin. MLL fusion proteins associated with human leukemia contain the menin interaction peptide and frequently recruit H3K79 (histone H3 lysine 79) methylation activity. This allows sustained expression of HOXA genes important for cellular transformation. We have characterized a novel recurrent chromosomal aberration, inv(11)(p15q23), as an isolated chromosomal abnormality in 2 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. This aberration is predicted to result in the expression of an NUP98 (nucleoporin 98 kDa)-MLL fusion protein that is unable to interact with menin. As expected, low levels of HOXA gene expression were observed in the patients' samples. This fusion protein is predicted to participate in cellular transformation by activating MLL targets other than HOXA genes.","['Kaltenbach, Sophie', 'Soler, Gwendoline', 'Barin, Carole', 'Gervais, Carine', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Penard-Lacronique, Virginie', 'Romana, Serge P']","['Kaltenbach S', 'Soler G', 'Barin C', 'Gervais C', 'Bernard OA', 'Penard-Lacronique V', 'Romana SP']","['INSERM U985, Institut Gustave Roussy, 39 rue Camille Desmoulins, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34554-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-04-277806 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 30;116(13):2332-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-04-277806.

It plays a major role during embryogenesis and epithelial tissue organization. Here we found that PTK7 is also expressed in normal myeloid progenitors and CD34(+) CD38(-) bone marrow cells in humans. We performed an immunophenotyping screen on more than 300 patients treated for hematologic malignancies. We demonstrated that PTK7 is expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is mostly assigned to granulocytic lineage differentiation. Patients with PTK7-positive AML are more resistant to anthracycline-based frontline therapy with a significantly reduced leukemia-free survival in a multivariate analysis model. In vitro, expression of PTK7 in cultured leukemia cells promotes cell migration, cell survival, and resistance to anthracycline-induced apoptosis. The intracellular region of PTK7 is required for these effects. Furthermore, we efficiently sensitized primary AML blasts to anthracycline-mediated cell death using a recombinant soluble PTK7-Fc protein. We conclude that PTK7 is a planar cell polarity component expressed in the myeloid progenitor compartment that conveys promigratory and antiapoptotic signals into the cell and that represents an independent prognosis factor of survival in patients treated with induction chemotherapy.","['Prebet, Thomas', 'Lhoumeau, Anne-Catherine', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Aulas, Anais', 'Marchetto, Sylvie', 'Audebert, Stephane', 'Puppo, Francesca', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Santoni, Marie-Josee', 'Sebbagh, Michael', 'Summerour, Virginia', 'Huon, Yannick', 'Shin, Won-Sik', 'Lee, Seung-Taek', 'Esterni, Benjamin', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Borg, Jean-Paul']","['Prebet T', 'Lhoumeau AC', 'Arnoulet C', 'Aulas A', 'Marchetto S', 'Audebert S', 'Puppo F', 'Chabannon C', 'Sainty D', 'Santoni MJ', 'Sebbagh M', 'Summerour V', 'Huon Y', 'Shin WS', 'Lee ST', 'Esterni B', 'Vey N', 'Borg JP']","['INSERM U891, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PTK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'U937 Cells']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/10/30 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34552-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-262352 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 30;116(13):2315-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-262352.

Despite considerable progress during the past 3 decades in the therapy of AML, two-thirds of young adults and 90% of older adults still die of their disease. The reported median age has increased over the past few decades, mostly because of a greater willingness of physicians to diagnose and treat older patients, and now is 72 years. The greatest challenge is in this age group. However, much improvement in therapy is needed for all adults with AML. Recent advances in allogeneic transplantation, a better understanding of prognostic factors, and development of targeted agents have only modestly improved overall outcome when large populations of patients are considered. Although an explosion in knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of AML has outpaced treatment advances, such insights hold promise for the development of new therapies directed at specific molecular abnormalities that perturb malignant cell survival pathways.

METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of CD147 and vascular endothelial growth factor in paraffin-embedded sections from 62 bone marrow biopsies obtained from an equal number of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: CD147 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the bone marrow of acute myeloid leukemia patients were significantly higher than those in normal controls (both P < 0.001). Expression of them was significantly increased in patients with a high degree of microvessel density compared with those with a low degree (CD147: P = 0.009; vascular endothelial growth factor: P = 0.01) and correlated well with bone marrow microvessel density (CD147: P = 0.01; vascular endothelial growth factor: P = 0.02). In addition, higher levels of CD147 and vascular endothelial growth factor were also found in acute myeloid leukemia patients with an unfavorable karyotype compared with those with intermediate and favorable karyotypes (both P = 0.01). Moreover, the expression of CD147 was significantly correlated with that of vascular endothelial growth factor (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the co-expression of CD147 and vascular endothelial growth factor in the bone marrow indicated a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia and was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival by multivariate analysis.

To identify patient, disease, and treatment characteristics associated with outcome, we analyzed prognostic factors in 98 consecutive patients who underwent second transplants using allogeneic donors at the Cleveland Clinic between May 1987 and October 2008. Inclusion criteria included age >/=18 years, first SCT either autologous or allogeneic, and second SCT allogeneic. Patients whose second transplant was myeloablative (MA) had shorter survival (median 3.2 versus 14.7 months, P < .001) than patients whose second transplant was nonmyeloablative (NMA). In multivariable analysis, MA second transplant was associated with a higher risk of NRM (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01, P = 0.022) and death (HR 2.13, P = 0.002). Improved survival after NMA second transplant occurred primarily in patients without acute leukemia and when the first transplant was allogeneic. Among 17 patients transplanted within 3 months of first transplant, mortality was 100% and median survival was 2.3 months. MA transplantation within 3 months of prior SCT carries an unacceptably high rate of NRM. NMA second transplants were associated with substantially less NRM and despite a higher incidence of relapse, significantly improved survival compared to MA second transplants.","['Hill, Brian T', 'Bolwell, Brian J', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Dean, Robert', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Tench, Shawnda', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Andresen, Steven', 'Copelan, Edward']","['Hill BT', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Rybicki L', 'Dean R', 'Kalaycio M', 'Pohlman B', 'Tench S', 'Sobecks R', 'Andresen S', 'Copelan E']","['Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. hillb2@ccf.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100614,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/19 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00253-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Dec;16(12):1738-46. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.009.

We compared karyotypes in 160 patients at both diagnosis and relapse either after allo-HSCT (n = 26) or standard chemotherapy (n = 134) using chromosome banding analysis combined with fluorescein in situ hybridization. There were 71 females and 89 males (19.7-80.6 years). At diagnosis, aberrant karyotypes were more frequent in the HSCT than in the chemotherapy cohort (16 of 26; 61.5% versus 63 of 134; 47.0%). This was most obvious in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics (8 of 26; 30.8% versus 19 of 134; 14.2%; P = .032). Differences in the karyotypes between diagnosis and relapse were more frequent in the allo-cohort (14 of 26; 53.8% versus 49 of 134; 36.6%) than in the conventional cohort (n.s.), mainly because of newly emerging cytogenetic alterations.

The mean number of cytogenetic alterations per patient was increasing from 2.0 at diagnosis to 4.0 at relapse in the allo-cohort, in the conventionally treated patients from 0.9 to 1.3 (both P < .001). Thus, higher frequencies of clonal evolution and increasing cytogenetic complexity were observed in the stem cell recipients probably related to the more unfavorable cytogenetic profiles already depicted at diagnosis.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Zenger, Melanie', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach T', 'Alpermann T', 'Zenger M', 'Kroger N', 'Beelen DW', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C']","['Interdisciplinary Clinic for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, Hamburg, Germany. u.bacher@uke.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100614,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/19 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00251-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Dec;16(12):1649-57. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.007.

Outcome of patients with clinical relapse after transplantation generally remains poor, but intervention prior to florid relapse improves outcome for certain hematologic malignancies. To detect early relapse or minimal residual disease, sensitive methods such as molecular genetics, tumor-specific molecular primers, fluorescein in situ hybridization, and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) are commonly used after allogeneic stem cell transplantation to monitor patients, but not all of them are included in the commonly employed disease-specific response criteria. The highest sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by molecular monitoring of tumor- or patient-specific markers measured by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, but not all diseases have such targets for monitoring. Similar high sensitivity can be achieved by determination of donor chimerism, but its specificity regarding detection of relapse is low and differs substantially among diseases. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about the utilization of such sensitive monitoring techniques based on tumor-specific markers and donor cell chimerism and how these methods might augment the standard definitions of posttransplant remission, persistence, progression, relapse, and the prediction of relapse. Critically important is the need for standardization of the different residual disease techniques and to assess the clinical relevance of minimal residual disease and chimerism surveillance in individual diseases, which in turn, must be followed by studies to assess the potential impact of specific interventional strategies.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Bader, Peter', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Khouri, Issa', 'Macapinlac, Homer A', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Willasch, Andre', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Bishop, Michael R', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Kroger N', 'Bacher U', 'Bader P', 'Bottcher S', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Dreger P', 'Khouri I', 'Macapinlac HA', 'Olavarria E', 'Radich J', 'Stock W', 'Vose JM', 'Weisdorf D', 'Willasch A', 'Giralt S', 'Bishop MR', 'Wayne AS']","['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinstrasse 52, Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100614,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chimerism', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Disease Progression', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",2010/06/19 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00252-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Sep;16(9):1187-211. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.008.

The HTLV-1 proto-oncogene Tax, a potent transcriptional activator of cellular and viral genes, is thought to play a pivotal role in the transforming properties of the virus by deregulating intracellular signaling pathways. During the course of HTLV-1 infection, the dysregulation of cell-cycle checkpoints and the suppression of DNA damage repair is tightly linked to the activity of the viral oncoprotein Tax. Tax activity is associated with production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROS), chromosomal instability and DNA damage, apoptotic cell death and cellular transformation. Changes in the intracellular redox status induced by Tax promote DNA damage. Tax-mediated DNA damage is believed to be essential in initiating the transformation process by subjecting infected T cells to genetic changes that eventually promote the neoplastic state. Apoptosis and immune surveillance would then exert the necessary selection pressure for eliminating the majority of virally infected cells, while escape variants acquiring a mutator phenotype would constitute a subpopulation of genetically altered cells prone to neoplasia. While the potency of Tax-activity seems to be a determining factor for the observed effects, the cooperation of Tax with other viral proteins determines the fate and progression of HTLV-1-infected cells through DNA damage, apoptosis, survival and transformation.","['Chlichlia, Katerina', 'Khazaie, Khashayarsha']","['Chlichlia K', 'Khazaie K']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece. achlichl@mbg.duth.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100615,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*DNA Damage', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(10)00387-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2010.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Nov 5;188(2):359-65. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2010.06.005.

We aimed to determine the optimal role of UCB grafts in transplantation for adults with acute leukaemia, and to establish whether current graft-selection practices are appropriate. METHODS: We used Cox regression to retrospectively compare leukaemia-free survival and other outcomes for UCB, PBPC, and bone marrow transplantation in patients aged 16 years or over who underwent a transplant for acute leukaemia. Data were available on 1525 patients transplanted between 2002 and 2006. 165 received UCB, 888 received PBPCs, and 472 received bone marrow. UCB units were matched at HLA-A and HLA-B at antigen level, and HLA-DRB1 at allele level (n=10), or mismatched at one (n=40) or two (n=115) antigens. PBPCs and bone-marrow grafts from unrelated adult donors were matched for allele-level HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 (n=632 and n=332, respectively), or mismatched at one locus (n=256 and n=140, respectively). FINDINGS: Leukaemia-free survival in patients after UCB transplantation was comparable with that after 8/8 and 7/8 allele-matched PBPC or bone-marrow transplantation. However, transplant-related mortality was higher after UCB transplantation than after 8/8 allele-matched PBPC recipients (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.18-2.23; p=0.003) or bone-marrow transplantation (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.19-2.39; p=0.003). Grades 2-4 acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were lower in UCB recipients compared with allele-matched PBPC (HR 0.57, 95% 0.42-0.77; p=0.002 and HR 0.38, 0.27-0.53; p=0.003, respectively), while the incidence of chronic, but not acute GvHD, was lower after UCB than after 8/8 allele-matched bone-marrow transplantation (HR 0.63, 0.44-0.90; p=0.01). INTERPRETATION: These data support the use of UCB for adults with acute leukaemia when there is no HLA-matched unrelated adult donor available, and when a transplant is needed urgently.","['Eapen, Mary', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Arcese, William', 'Sirvent, Anne', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Chao, Nelson', 'Gee, Adrian P', 'Isola, Luis', 'Laughlin, Mary J', 'Marks, David I', 'Nabhan, Samir', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Soiffer, Robert', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Wagner, John E']","['Eapen M', 'Rocha V', 'Sanz G', 'Scaradavou A', 'Zhang MJ', 'Arcese W', 'Sirvent A', 'Champlin RE', 'Chao N', 'Gee AP', 'Isola L', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Marks DI', 'Nabhan S', 'Ruggeri A', 'Soiffer R', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gluckman E', 'Wagner JE']","['Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, MW, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

HCl-V is now included in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification as a provisional entity. It is an uncommon disorder accounting for approximately 0.4% of chronic lymphoid malignancies and 10% of all HCl cases. In contrast to HCl-C, HCl-V is a more aggressive disease and according to the new WHO classification it is no longer considered to be biologically related to HCl-C. Patients with HCl-V have an elevated white blood count, easy-to-aspirate bone marrow and weak reactivity to tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Immunophenotypically, HCl-V cells are positive for CD103 and CD11c and negative for CD25. The HCl-V cells express also the B-cell antigens, CD19, CD20 and CD22. The HCl-V patients have frequently an unmutated Ig gene configuration. Currently, the principles of therapy for this rare disease derive from uncontrolled single institutional studies, or even single case reports. In contrast to HCl-C, the HCl-V response to purine nucleoside analogs (PNA) is limited to partial responses in approximately 50% of patients. However, complete responses were observed in patients treated with rituximab and anti-CD22 immunotoxins. In Japan, a distinct subtype of HCl known as HCl-Japanese variant (HCl-JV) has been identified.

METHODS: Forty-six children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were examined, the age ranged from 3 to 12 years with a mean age of 7(1/2) years. They were under maintenance stage chemotherapy at the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. A control group of healthy children was recruited by age and sex-matching criteria. The children received only a clinical dental examination without radiographs. Decayed (D), Missing (M), and Filled (F) Tooth surfaces (S) scores were recorded following the WHO criteria. After oral examination, stimulated saliva samples were collected from the subjects to exam the salivary Streptococcus mutans counts, salivary lactobacilli counts and salivary buffer capacity. RESULT: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows that the salivary Streptococcus mutans counts in ALL children were significantly lower than healthy subjects (P<.001) and lactobacilli counts were similar on both groups (P=.47). However, the ALL group tended to have lower salivary buffer capacity than the control group (P=.002). The mean DEFTS/DMFTS scores of the ALL group were higher than the control group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Specific oral prevention regimens for ALL children undergoing chemotherapy should be planned for patients with unusually low salivary buffer capacity.","['Ou-Yang, Li-Wei', 'Chang, Pei-Ching', 'Tsai, Aileen I', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Lin, Shiao-Yu']","['Ou-Yang LW', 'Chang PC', 'Tsai AI', 'Jaing TH', 'Lin SY']","['Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan (Republic of China).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Dent,Pediatric dentistry,7909102,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'DMF Index', 'Dental Caries/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Dental Caries Activity Tests', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactobacillus/isolation & purification', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', '*Oral Hygiene', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology/physiopathology', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Saliva/microbiology/*physiology', 'Streptococcus mutans/isolation & purification']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Dent. 2010 May-Jun;32(3):218-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gossypol was found to be cytotoxic in HL-60 cells with the IC(50) dose of 4.5 microM. The combination of gossypol and okadaic acid in IC(50) doses revealed the increased cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner. Treatment of cells with gossypol has shown significant decrease in PP2A activity. The expression of the PP2A catalytic subunit was downregulated in gossypol-treated cells with 24 hours' intervals. hTERT mRNA levels were gradually decreased. In conclusion, during gossypol-induced cytotoxicity, intracellular activity and expression of PP2A was decreased as well as the activity of hTERT. The variation of hTERT activity in gossypol-treated HL-60 cells may be the potential reason for the phosphatase interaction during the gossypol treatment of leukemic cells resulting in cellular cytotoxicity.","['Sahin, Fahri', 'Avci, Cigir Biray', 'Gunduz, Cumhur', 'Sezgin, Canfeza', 'Simsir, Ilgin Yildirim', 'Saydam, Guray']","['Sahin F', 'Avci CB', 'Gunduz C', 'Sezgin C', 'Simsir IY', 'Saydam G']","['Department of Hematology, Ege University School of Medicine, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/10/15 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X12583347113771 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2010 Jun;15(3):144-50. doi: 10.1179/102453309X12583347113771.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, Src is overexpressed or hyperactivated in a variety of solid tumors, while Bcr-Abl is the causative agent of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where Src is also involved. The two enzymes share significant sequence homology and remarkable structural resemblance. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: ATP-competitive compounds originally developed as Src inhibitors, showed to be also potent Abl inhibitors. Dasatinib, the first dual Src/Abl inhibitor approved by the US FDA in 2006 for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML, is currently being tested in several clinical trials for the treatment of different solid tumors. SKI-606 and AZD0530 are two other important dual Src/Abl inhibitors extensively tested in animal models and in clinical trials, but not entered into therapy yet. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: In this review we will report the latest results regarding dasatinib, SKI-606 and AZD0530, but also the knowledge on new compounds that have appeared in the literature in the last few years, including AP24163, AP24534, XL228, DC2036. We will focus on the most recent clinical trials or on preclinical studies that are in progress on these small-molecule TK inhibitors that represent a targeted therapy with high potential against cancer. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Molecularly targeted therapies, including the inhibition of specific TKs hyperactivated or overexpressed in many human cancers, could be less toxic than the classical non-specific cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents; they could offer important therapeutic effects, especially if used in association with other agents such as monoclonal antibodies.","['Schenone, Silvia', 'Brullo, Chiara', 'Musumeci, Francesca', 'Botta, Maurizio']","['Schenone S', 'Brullo C', 'Musumeci F', 'Botta M']","['University of Genoa, Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Viale Benedetto VX, Genoa, Italy. schensil@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triazines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '9KD24QGH76 (saracatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.23 (CSK protein, human)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzodioxoles/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Dogs', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Nitriles/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Thiazoles/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Triazines/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases']",2010/06/19 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/06/19 06:00'],"['2010/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2010.499898 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010 Aug;19(8):931-45. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2010.499898.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blast count >5% was related to lower number of CD3+CD4+ (day +30) and NK cells (day +180; p = 0.02). Intensity of conditioning did not have any significant impact on the kinetics of immune recovery. Patients with normal CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+ ratio (day +30) and NK cell count (day +90; p <0.05) experienced better survival than those with decreased parameters. Post-transplant sepsis/severe infections impaired CD3+CD8+ (day +90; p = 0.015) and CD19+ (day +90; p = 0.02) recovery. Relapse in patients following allo-SCT showed an association with decreased numbers of CD19+ (day +270) and NK cells (day +365). Acute GvHD (II-IV) was accompanied by reduced CD19+ and CD3+CD4+ cells.

The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification has designated AML with inv(3) or t(3;3) and associated RPN1/EVI1 fusion, as a distinct AML subgroup associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We have created a dual color, double fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) assay to detect fusion of the RPN1 and EVI1 genes. A blinded investigation was performed using 30 normal bone marrow samples and 51 bone marrow samples from 17 patients with inv(3)(q21q26.2), 11 patients with t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), and one patient with ins(3;3)(q26.2;q21q26.2) previously defined by chromosome analysis. The unblinded results indicated abnormal RPN1/EVI1 fusion results in 30 (97%) of 31 samples from the inv(3)(q21q26.2) group including seven bone marrow samples for which chromosome analysis was unsuccessful or failed to detect an inv(3)(q21q26.2). Abnormal FISH results were detected in 14 (88%) of 16 samples with t(3;3)(q21;q26.2) and in the sole sample with an ins(3;3)(q26.2;q21q26.2). All 30 negative controls were normal and were used to establish a normal cutoff of 0.6% for the typical abnormal D-FISH signal pattern. Overall, this D-FISH assay was more accurate than chromosome analysis and based on the normal cutoff of 0.6%, this assay can be used for minimal residual disease detection and disease monitoring in patients with RPN1/EVI1 fusion.","['Shearer, Brandon M', 'Sukov, William R', 'Flynn, Heather C', 'Knudson, Ryan A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P']","['Shearer BM', 'Sukov WR', 'Flynn HC', 'Knudson RA', 'Ketterling RP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RPN1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/08/12 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.21746 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2010 Aug;85(8):569-74. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21746.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these mAbs, cmHsp70.1, has been extensively studied and showed promising results as diagnostic and therapeutic antibody. Here, we describe cloning and humanization of cmHsp70.1 by complementarity determining region grafting resulting in an antibody (humex) possessing a similar affinity (3 nM) as the parental antibody and an improved production and thermal stability. Epitope mapping confirmed that the parental, chimeric, and humanized antibodies recognize the same region including amino acids 473-504 of the SBD.

The register data of 327 consecutive patients aged 16-66 years having de novo AML between September 1992 and December 2001 were prospectively gathered in five Finnish tertiary care leukemia centers. The patients had not received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Reported BSI rates were compared during neutropenia in four chemotherapy treatment cycles (C). There were 956 treatment episodes, with 456 (47.7%) positive blood cultures. BSI was monomicrobial in 327 episodes (71.7%) and polymicrobial in 129 (28.3%). The overall incidence rate (per 1,000 hospital days) for BSI was 13.2, varying from 6.8 in CI after idarubicin, conventional-dose cytarabine, and thioguanine to 15.6 in CII, 15.8 in CIII, and 17.6 in CIV. The distribution of monomicrobial gram-positive BSIs was as follows: CI, 71.7%; CII, 62.8%; CIII, 53.3%; CIV, 36.6%; and CI-IV together, 43.2%. The most common finding in the four different cycles was coagulase-negative staphylococci (38.3 to 30.6%). Viridans group streptococci were most commonly observed (in 20.4% of positive blood cultures) during CII after high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin treatments. The distribution of monomicrobial gram-negative BSIs was as follows: CI, 21.7%; CII, 36.3%; CIII, 45.7%; CIV, 46.9%; and CI-IV together, 37.9%. A great variation of incidence and types of microorganisms between AML chemotherapy cycles was found.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with acquired resistance to this agent, we established two bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines, KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ, the 50% inhibitory concentration values of which were respectively 24.7- and 16.6-fold higher than their parental cell lines. No activation of caspase and BH3-only proteins such as Noxa was noted in bortezomib-resistant cells after exposure to the drug. The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins was reduced in bortezomib-resistant cells compared with the parental cells, associated with avoidance of catastrophic ER stress as assessed by downregulation of CHOP expression. These resistant MM cells have a unique point mutation, G322A, in the gene encoding the proteasome beta5 subunit (PSMB5), likely resulting in conformational changes to the bortezomib-binding pocket of this subunit. KMS-11 parental cells transfected to express mutated PSMB5 also showed reduced bortezomib-induced apoptosis compared with those expressing wild-type PSMB5 or the parental cells. Expression of mutated PSMB5 was associated with the prevention of the accumulation of unfolded proteins. Thus, a fraction of MM cells may acquire bortezomib resistance by suppressing apoptotic signals through the inhibition of unfolded protein accumulation and subsequent excessive ER stress by a mutation of the PSMB5 gene.","['Ri, M', 'Iida, S', 'Nakashima, T', 'Miyazaki, H', 'Mori, F', 'Ito, A', 'Inagaki, A', 'Kusumoto, S', 'Ishida, T', 'Komatsu, H', 'Shiotsu, Y', 'Ueda, R']","['Ri M', 'Iida S', 'Nakashima T', 'Miyazaki H', 'Mori F', 'Ito A', 'Inagaki A', 'Kusumoto S', 'Ishida T', 'Komatsu H', 'Shiotsu Y', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100617,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMB5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010137 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Aug;24(8):1506-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.137.

This may aid to understand variability of treatment outcome, in patients with a CD20 positive malignancy treated with rituximab. METHODS: In this study, patients with a CD20 positive B-cell malignancy who were treated with rituximab containing regimens were included. Induction treatment schedules consisted of a combination of rituximab with chemotherapy for 4-8 cycles. Maintenance treatment consisted of a 2 or 3-monthly dose of 375 mg/m2 rituximab intravenously for 2 years. On the day of the treatment with rituximab, preinfusion blood samples were taken. Also, after the end of treatment, selected blood samples were taken. Rituximab levels were measured with a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An antigen binding assay was applied for determination of human-antibodies against chimeric-antibodies (HACAs). RESULTS: Eight patients were on induction therapy. Rituximab levels of one patient on induction therapy remained very low after the first course. This patient had a chronic lymphoid leukemia with circulating tumor cells and a high tumor burden. Apart from one patient with mantle cell lymphoma, all patients on induction therapy had a complete response. Five patients were on maintenance therapy. Trough levels of 4 patients on three-monthly schedule maintenance therapy remained constant, with a median concentration of 6 mu g/mL (range 0.5-11.7 microg/mL). One patient had a relapse during his maintenance treatment. The elimination half-life at steady state of rituximab in all patients was estimated to be 19.2 (+/- 15.2%) days with a between-subject variability of 54%, indicating wide variability. Possible pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship was observed as rituximab levels of the non-responders remained low compared to the rituximab levels of the responders. For all patients, concentration of HACAs remained below the quantification limit. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: Considerable inter-individual variability of rituximab levels was observed. Although the patient population was small, the results support the need for more research into the pharmacokinetics and factors that might influence the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of rituximab in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Tran, L', 'Baars, J W', 'Aarden, L', 'Beijnen, J H', 'Huitema, A D R']","['Tran L', 'Baars JW', 'Aarden L', 'Beijnen JH', 'Huitema AD']","['Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Slotervaart Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Molecularly, EMS is characterized by fusion of various partner genes to the FGFR1 gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinases in FGFR1. To date, no previous study has addressed the functional consequences of ectopic FGFR1 expression in the potentially most relevant cellular context, that of normal primary human hematopoietic cells. Herein, we report that expression of ZMYM2/FGFR1 (previously known as ZNF198/FGFR1) or BCR/FGFR1 in normal human CD34(+) cells from umbilical-cord blood leads to increased cellular proliferation and differentiation toward the erythroid lineage in vitro. In immunodeficient mice, expression of ZMYM2/FGFR1 or BCR/FGFR1 in human cells induces several features of human EMS, including expansion of several myeloid cell lineages and accumulation of blasts in bone marrow. Moreover, bone marrow fibrosis together with increased extramedullary hematopoiesis is observed. This study suggests that FGFR1 fusion oncogenes, by themselves, are capable of initiating an EMS-like disorder, and provides the first humanized model of a myeloproliferative disorder transforming into acute leukemia in mice. The established in vivo EMS model should provide a valuable tool for future studies of this disorder.","['Agerstam, Helena', 'Jaras, Marcus', 'Andersson, Anna', 'Johnels, Petra', 'Hansen, Nils', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Gisselsson, David', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Richter, Johan', 'Fan, Xiaolong', 'Ehinger, Mats', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Agerstam H', 'Jaras M', 'Andersson A', 'Johnels P', 'Hansen N', 'Lassen C', 'Rissler M', 'Gisselsson D', 'Olofsson T', 'Richter J', 'Fan X', 'Ehinger M', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. helena.agerstam@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100616,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZMYM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Primary Myelofibrosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)32960-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-217182 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Sep 23;116(12):2103-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-217182.

Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common inherited clotting factor mutation and also confers increased thrombosis risk. We investigated whether FVL was associated with TE risk in women with early-stage breast cancer who took adjuvant tamoxifen. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted among 34 Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) institutions. We matched each of 124 women who had experienced a documented TE while taking adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer (but who were not necessarily on a CALGB treatment trial) to two control subjects (women who took adjuvant tamoxifen but did not experience TE) by age at diagnosis (+/-5 years). DNA from blood was analyzed for FVL mutations. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and to evaluate other potential factors associated with TE and tamoxifen use. All P values are based on two-sided tests. RESULTS: FVL mutations were identified in 23 (18.5%) case and 12 (4.8%) control subjects (OR = 4.66, 95% confidence interval = 2.14 to 10.14, P < .001). In the multivariable model, FVL mutation was associated with TE (OR = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 2.10 to 10.68, P < .001). Other statistically significant factors associated with TE risk were personal history of TE and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Among women taking adjuvant tamoxifen for early-stage breast cancer, those who had a TE were nearly five times more likely to carry a FVL mutation than those who did not have a TE. Postmenopausal women should be evaluated for the FVL mutation before prescription of adjuvant tamoxifen if a positive test would alter therapeutic decision making.","['Garber, Judy E', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Tolaney, Sara M', 'Kaplan, Ellen', 'Archer, Laura', 'Atkins, James N', 'Edge, Stephen', 'Shapiro, Charles L', 'Dressler, Lynn', 'Paskett, Electra D', 'Kimmick, Gretchen', 'Orcutt, James', 'Scalzo, Anthony', 'Winer, Eric', 'Levine, Ellis', 'Shahab, Nasir', 'Berliner, Nancy']","['Garber JE', 'Halabi S', 'Tolaney SM', 'Kaplan E', 'Archer L', 'Atkins JN', 'Edge S', 'Shapiro CL', 'Dressler L', 'Paskett ED', 'Kimmick G', 'Orcutt J', 'Scalzo A', 'Winer E', 'Levine E', 'Shahab N', 'Berliner N']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA. judy_garber@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100616,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '0 (factor V Leiden)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Estrogen Receptor Modulators/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Factor V/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/adverse effects', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Tamoxifen/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics/prevention & control']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['djq211 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djq211 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Jul 7;102(13):942-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djq211.

Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes conjugate and detoxify endogenous and exogenous steroid hormones and environmental carcinogens. Among these enzymes, the function of UGT2B17 is unknown except for glucuronidation. The messenger RNA expression of UGT2B17 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was significantly increased in EC tissues compared with matched normal endometrial tissues. Therefore, we focused on the function of UGT2B17 in EC. A total of nine patients with confirmed EC were enrolled in this study to investigate the expression of UGT2B17 and target genes. EC cell lines were used for functional tests including cell growth, invasion, apoptosis and cell cycle analyses. To find the target genes of UGT2B17, we performed microarray analysis to see which genes were upregulated or downregulated by UGT2B17-transfected cells. Functional analysis showed decreased numbers of viable cells and increased numbers of apoptotic cells in si-UGT2B17-transfected Ishikawa cells. Among microarray target genes, Mcl-1 was significantly downregulated in si-UGT2B17-transfected cells. We also found upregulation of Puma protein, a target of Mcl-1, in si-UGT2B17-transfected cells. This is the first report to show that UGT2B17 and Mcl-1 expression are upregulated in EC tissues and that UGT2B17 depletion induces inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis in EC cells through Mcl-1 downregulation.","['Hirata, Hiroshi', 'Hinoda, Yuji', 'Zaman, Mohd S', 'Chen, Yi', 'Ueno, Koji', 'Majid, Shahana', 'Tripsas, Christina', 'Rubin, Mary', 'Chen, Lee-May', 'Dahiya, Rajvir']","['Hirata H', 'Hinoda Y', 'Zaman MS', 'Chen Y', 'Ueno K', 'Majid S', 'Tripsas C', 'Rubin M', 'Chen LM', 'Dahiya R']","['Department of Urology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of California at San Francisco, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100616,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (UGT2B17 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genotype', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['bgq124 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgq124 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Sep;31(9):1620-6. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgq124.

We have previously reported the development of 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine ((18)F-FAC), a new probe for PET of dCK activity in immune disorders and certain cancers. The objective of the current study was to develop PET probes with improved metabolic stability and specificity for dCK. Toward this goal, several candidate PET probes were synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to analyze the metabolic stability of (18)F-FAC and several newly synthesized analogs with the natural D-enantiomeric sugar configuration or the corresponding unnatural L-configuration. In vitro kinase and uptake assays were used to determine the affinity of the (18)F-FAC L-nucleoside analogs for dCK. The biodistribution of selected L-analogs in mice was determined by small-animal PET/CT. RESULTS: Candidate PET probes were selected using the following criteria: low susceptibility to deamination, high affinity for purified recombinant dCK, high uptake in dCK-expressing cell lines, and biodistribution in mice reflective of the tissue-expression pattern of dCK. Among the 10 newly developed candidate probes, 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-beta-L-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (L-(18)F-FAC) and 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-(18)F-fluoro-beta-L-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methylcytosine (L-(18)F-FMAC) most closely matched the selection criteria. The selection of L-(18)F-FAC and L-(18)F-FMAC was validated by showing that these two PET probes could be used to image animal models of leukemia and autoimmunity. CONCLUSION: Promising in vitro and in vivo data warrant biodistribution and dosimetry studies of L-(18)F-FAC and L-(18)F-FMAC in humans.","['Shu, Chengyi J', 'Campbell, Dean O', 'Lee, Jason T', 'Tran, Andrew Q', 'Wengrod, Jordan C', 'Witte, Owen N', 'Phelps, Michael E', 'Satyamurthy, Nagichettiar', 'Czernin, Johannes', 'Radu, Caius G']","['Shu CJ', 'Campbell DO', 'Lee JT', 'Tran AQ', 'Wengrod JC', 'Witte ON', 'Phelps ME', 'Satyamurthy N', 'Czernin J', 'Radu CG']","['Division of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100616,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Animals', 'Arabinonucleosides', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Clofarabine', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnostic imaging', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', '*Radiopharmaceuticals/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Whole Body Imaging']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['jnumed.109.073361 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.109.073361 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2010 Jul;51(7):1092-8. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.109.073361.

A poor fibrinogen (FBG) response during ATRA and chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding (p = 0.003). Increased LDH and decreased FBG levels were associated with an increased incidence of bleeding, and low PLT count was correlated with death from bleeding.

The cumulative incidence (CI) of myeloid engraftment was 88% at a median time of 22 days and was significantly better for patients receiving higher doses of CD34(+) cells. The CI of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was 61%, that of acute GVHD grade III-IV was 39%, and that of chronic extensive GVHD was 60%. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 41% for patients undergoing UCBT while in first or second CP and 100% for patients in AP or BC (P < .01). After a median follow-up of 8 years, none of the patients relapsed, giving an overall disease-free survival (DFS) at 8 years of 41%. The DFS for patients undergoing UCBT while in any CP was 59%. These results demonstrate that UCBT from unrelated donors can be a curative treatment for a substantial number of patients with CML. Advances in supportive care and better selection of cord blood units and patients are needed to improve TRM.","['Sanz, Jaime', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Saavedra, Silvana', 'Lorenzo, Ignacio', 'Senent, Leonor', 'Planelles, Dolores', 'Larrea, Luis', 'Martin, Guillermo', 'Palau, Javier', 'Jarque, Isidro', 'Martinez, Jesus', 'de la Rubia, Javier', 'Moscardo, Federico', 'Martinez, David', 'Gomez, Ines', 'Lopez, Maria', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Sanz, Guillermo F']","['Sanz J', 'Montesinos P', 'Saavedra S', 'Lorenzo I', 'Senent L', 'Planelles D', 'Larrea L', 'Martin G', 'Palau J', 'Jarque I', 'Martinez J', 'de la Rubia J', 'Moscardo F', 'Martinez D', 'Gomez I', 'Lopez M', 'Sanz MA', 'Sanz GF']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain. sanz_jai@gva.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100527,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Donors', 'Cause of Death', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Platelet Count', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/18 06:00,2011/03/05 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00226-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Nov;16(11):1589-95. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.014.

Patients were divided according to cytogenetic abnormalities based on the Medical Research Council, Southwest Oncology Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), Dana-Farber, and recently described monosomal karyotype (MK) classification schemes and analyzed separately for first complete remission (CR1; n = 134) and beyond (CR2+; n = 78). Multivariate analysis was performed after adjusting for age, conditioning intensity, donor type, and cytomegalovirus serology status. Although none of the covariates was associated with OS in CR1, the presence of MK (MK(+)) was associated with worse RI and PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.3, P = .01 and HR, 2.0, P = .05, respectively). No other classification scheme was predictive of outcomes in CR1. In CR2+, for RI, only MK(+) was predictive of poor outcome (HR, 3.7; P = .03). For PFS, all 5 classification schemes were predictive, and for OS, both the MK(+) and CALGB adverse karyotypes were predictive. In addition to cytogenetics, nonmyeloablative conditioning was associated with decreased PFS and OS in patients in CR2+ in all models. Our results indicate that among all classification schemes, MK classification can identify a subgroup with very poor prognosis in patients with AML after allogeneic HSCT.","['Oran, Betul', 'Dolan, Michelle', 'Cao, Qing', 'Brunstein, Claudio', 'Warlick, Erica', 'Weisdorf, Daniel']","['Oran B', 'Dolan M', 'Cao Q', 'Brunstein C', 'Warlick E', 'Weisdorf D']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. oranx002@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100527,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/18 06:00,2011/06/04 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00224-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Mar;17(3):356-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.012.

Cladribine (2CdA) is a nucleoside analog that has been introduced as a promising agent for treatment of advanced SM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the in vitro effects of 2CdA on growth of neoplastic MC, and the in vivo effects of 2CdA (0.13 mg/kg/day intravenously, days 1-5; three to eight cycles) in seven patients with advanced SM. RESULTS: Cladribine was found to inhibit growth of primary MC and the MC line HMC-1 in a dose-dependent manner, with lower IC(50) values recorded in HMC-1.2 cells harboring KIT D816V (IC(50): 10 ng/mL) compared to HMC-1.1 cells lacking KIT D816V (IC(50): 300 ng/mL). In two patients with progressive smoldering SM, 2CdA produced a long-lasting response with a sustained decrease in serum tryptase levels, whereas in patients with progressive ASM or MCL, 2CdA showed little if any effects. The drug was well-tolerated in most cases. However, one patient developed a massive generalized purulent long-lasting skin rash. The antiproliferative effects of 2CdA on MC were found to be associated with morphologic signs of apoptosis and caspase cleavage. Cladribine did not counteract the kinase activity of KIT D816V or KIT-downstream signaling molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine may be a promising agent for treatment of progressive smoldering KIT D816V(+) SM. In rapidly progressing ASM or MCL, additional or alternative drugs are required to induce long-lasting antineoplastic effects.","['Bohm, Alexandra', 'Sonneck, Karoline', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Schuch, Karina', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Schernthaner, Gerit-Holger', 'Pehamberger, Hubert', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Bohm A', 'Sonneck K', 'Gleixner KV', 'Schuch K', 'Pickl WF', 'Blatt K', 'Peter B', 'Herrmann H', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Pehamberger H', 'Rabitsch W', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100527,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tryptases/blood']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00202-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Sep;38(9):744-55. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.05.006.

The Hth domain mediates interaction with Pbx homeodomain proteins, allowing for efficient DNA binding. Here we show that, like Meis1, Meis2 has a strong C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, which is required for full activation of transcription by homeodomain protein complexes composed of Meis2 and Pbx1. We also show that the activity of the activation domain is inhibited by the Hth domain, and that this autoinhibition can be partially relieved by the interaction of Pbx1 with the Hth domain of Meis2. Targeting of the Hth domain to DNA suggests that it is not a portable trans-acting repression domain. However, the Hth domain can inhibit a linked activation domain, and this inhibition is not limited to the Meis2 activation domain. Database searching reveals that the Meis3.2 splice variant, which is found in several vertebrate species, disrupts the Hth domain by removing 17 codons from the 5'-end of exon 6. We show that the equivalent deletion in Meis2 derepresses the C-terminal activation domain and weakens interaction with Pbx1. This work suggests that the transcriptional activity of all members of the Meis/Prep Hth protein family is subject to autoinhibition by their Hth domains, and that the Meis3.2 splice variant encodes a protein that bypasses this autoinhibitory effect.","['Hyman-Walsh, Cathy', 'Bjerke, Glen A', 'Wotton, David']","['Hyman-Walsh C', 'Bjerke GA', 'Wotton D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, and Center for Cell Signaling, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS2 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (hth protein, Drosophila)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7668 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-464X.2010.07668.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2010 Jun;277(12):2584-97. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-464X.2010.07668.x.,,,"['P30 DK067629/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD039926/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4306237,,,,['NIHMS550505'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose reductions and treatment interruptions are frequently required due to toxicity, but their significance is unknown. We analysed the impact of dose reductions/interruptions and dose intensity of 2nd-generation TKI on response and survival. A total of 280 patients with CML (all phases) were analysed. Dose reductions were considered when the daily dose was below the standard dose. Dose intensity was determined based on the percentage of the ideal dose intensity. Overall, 176 patients (63%) required treatment interruptions and/or dose reduction at least once during therapy. Dose reductions/interruptions, analysed as a time-dependent covariate, were associated with worse failure-free survival only in patients with untreated CML. Dose intensity analysis did not reveal a worse response or survival in patients who received a lower dose intensity (<100%) during therapy or during the first 6 months. In conclusion, dose reductions and treatment interruptions of 2nd generation TKI in patients with CML have a minimal impact in the response rate and survival of these patients.

BCR-ABL1 negative MPN displays myeloproliferation with an elevated leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity, a neutrophil activation marker. We tried to separate the downstream signalling of JAK2 V617F to stimulate myeloproliferation and LAP activity. NB4, a myeloid lineage cell line, was transduced with Jak2 V617F mutation or wild-type Jak2. We found that Jak2 V617F mutation, but not wild-type Jak2 enhanced LAP expression in NB4-derived neutrophils and proliferation of NB4 cells. JAK2 V617F induces constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5, and uses signalling targets such as Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. By using MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and STAT3 or STAT5 siRNAs, JAK2 V617F was found to specifically use the STAT3 pathway to enhance LAP expression, while STAT5, Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, but not STAT3 pathways, were able to stimulate cell proliferation. These data strongly suggest that JAK2 V617F uses distinct signalling pathways to induce typical pathological features of MPN, such as high LAP activity and enhanced cell proliferation.","['Oku, Seido', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Shide, Kotaro', 'Kumano, Takashi', 'Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Urata, Shingo', 'Yamauchi, Takuji', 'Iwamoto, Chika', 'Shimoda, Haruko K', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Kishimoto, Junji', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Oku S', 'Takenaka K', 'Kuriyama T', 'Shide K', 'Kumano T', 'Kikushige Y', 'Urata S', 'Yamauchi T', 'Iwamoto C', 'Shimoda HK', 'Miyamoto T', 'Nagafuji K', 'Kishimoto J', 'Shimoda K', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100610,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neutrophil Activation/*genetics/physiology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2010/06/18 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8249 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08249.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Aug;150(3):334-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08249.x.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a combination of genetic parameters can improve prediction of outcome irrespective of clinical stage. The prognostic impact of chromosome banding analysis (CBA) in addition to FISH and IgVH mutation status was evaluated. In total, 482 patients were analyzed, but evaluation of prognostic factors was restricted to 399 untreated cases. The prognostic significance of age, white blood cell (WBC) count, IgVH status, and TP53 and ATM deletions was confirmed. In addition, a prognostic impact of translocations involving the IGH@ locus (t(IgH)) and of a complex aberrant karyotype was found. On the basis of these results, we propose a scoring system for overall survival (OS) based on: age >or=65 years, WBC >or=20 x 10(9)/l, unmutated IgVH status, TP53 deletion, t(IgH), and the number of chromosome aberrations observed with CBA. Three risk groups showed considerable differences in OS (94.5% vs. 64.3% vs. 41.1% surviving at 5 years, P < 0.0001). Time to treatment (TTT) can be predicted best by unmutated IgVH status, ATM deletion, t(IgH), and number of chromosome aberrations. Four distinct subgroups were separated with median TTT of 110.7 months, 39.8 months, 19.5 months, and 3.8 months, respectively (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, cytogenetic data from CBA add prognostic information. The proposed scoring systems for OS and TTT based on a combination of genetic markers improve the separation of prognostic subgroups in CLL already early in the course of the disease.","['Haferlach, Claudia', 'Dicker, Frank', 'Weiss, Tamara', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Beck, Christian', 'Grote-Metke, Albert', 'Oruzio, Daniel', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Haferlach C', 'Dicker F', 'Weiss T', 'Schnittger S', 'Beck C', 'Grote-Metke A', 'Oruzio D', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. claudia.haferlach@mll-online.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20794 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Sep;49(9):851-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20794.,,,,,"['(c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently we reported a novel function of retinol, the alcohol form of vitamin A, in preventing the differentiation of mouse ES cells. Retinol/vitamin A induces the overexpression of Nanog, a key transcription factor that is important for maintaining the pluripotency of mouse and human ES cells. Further, retinol/vitamin A also supports feeder-independent culture of ES cells in long-term cultures. The cells continue to maintain the expression of pluripotent cell-specific markers such as Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 and form chimeric animals after injection into blastocysts. In this chapter, we describe feeder-independent cultures of mouse ES cells in the medium supplemented with retinol. The ES cells are cultured over plates coated with gelatin in ES medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which is supplemented with 0.5 muM retinol/vitamin A. The cells are passaged every 3-5 days by trypsinization. The pluripotency of the cells is tested by different undifferentiated ES cell-specific markers.","['Khillan, Jaspal S', 'Chen, Liguo']","['Khillan JS', 'Chen L']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Mice', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vitamin A/*pharmacology']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/09/10 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60327-325-1_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;652:75-83. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-325-1_3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that human dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with alpha-GalCer (hDC/Gal) and injected into C57BL/6 mice stimulated the secretion of IFN-gamma by activated murine NKT cells. Furthermore, the number of transferred hDC/Gal correlated with the number of recovered IFN-gamma-producing spleen cells, indicating that the capacity of APCs to load alpha-GalCer can be measured by IFN-gamma release in an ELISPOT assay. Finally, alpha-GalCer-loaded human leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells injected into C57BL/6 mice also had the capacity to stimulate murine NKT cells in vivo. These results indicate that in vivo murine NKT cell responses can be used to quantitate the alpha-GalCer-loading capacity of human APCs.

METHODS: We studied 21 childhood ALL long-term survivors (aged 16-30 years, median time since diagnosis 15.9 y), diagnosed in 1986-1996, with age- and sex-matched controls. Peak oxygen uptake (VO(2 peak)) and muscle strength were measured and physical activity index (PAI; MET h/week) calculated. RESULTS: Mean VO(2 peak) of the ALL survivors was 34.8 +/- 9.3 ml/kg/min. This was 14% lower than that of the controls (-5.7 ml/kg/min, 95% CI -9.4 to -1.9, p=0.01), and all the 11 female survivors performed below the age-adjusted reference values. The survivors also performed poorer in the sit-up and maximal jump tests (p=0.02 and p=0.004). Body mass index and PAI were similar in survivors and controls (p=0.34 and p=0.52). Nonetheless, as much as 30% of the male survivors and 36% of the female survivors had PAI </= 5 indicating very low levels of physical activity (PA). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient PA and poor physical fitness are clinically important issues in childhood ALL long-term survivors treated with modern protocols. Girls seem to be especially at risk. PA and better physical fitness decrease cardiovascular mortality irrespective of weight. Thus, PA should be promoted throughout and after the treatment for ALL. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Since insufficient PA and poor physical fitness are an issue in very long-term ALL survivors, they should be informed on the benefits of physical activity, and be strongly encouraged to adopt a physically active lifestyle.","['Jarvela, Liisa S', 'Niinikoski, Harri', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Heinonen, Olli J', 'Kapanen, Jukka', 'Arola, Mikko', 'Kemppainen, Jukka']","['Jarvela LS', 'Niinikoski H', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Heinonen OJ', 'Kapanen J', 'Arola M', 'Kemppainen J']","['Department of Paediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, FI-20520, Turku, Finland. liisa.jarvela@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100615,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maximal Voluntary Ventilation', '*Motor Activity/physiology', 'Obesity/epidemiology', '*Physical Fitness/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/physiopathology/*rehabilitation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/17 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-010-0131-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2010 Dec;4(4):339-45. doi: 10.1007/s11764-010-0131-0.

Such correlation has been shown in Asian populations in some studies. We analyzed the correlation between mortality and incidence from a number of cancers and ambient solar ultraviolet (UV) B irradiance in China. METHODS: Cancer mortality data were obtained from the Second National Death Survey conducted in a sample of 263 counties in China from 1990 to 1992. National cancer registration data 1998-2002 in China were used for estimation of cancer incidence. Satellite measurements of cloud-adjusted ambient UVB intensity at 305 nm were obtained from a NASA database and GIS methods used to estimate the average daily irradiance for the 263 counties in 1990. We estimated cancer mortality rate ratios per 10 mW/(nm m(2)) change in UVB by fitting a negative binomial regression model with mortality as the response variable and UVB as the independent variable, adjusted for sex, age, and urban or rural area. RESULTS: Mortality rates for all cancers and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, lung, breast, and bladder were inversely correlated with ambient UVB. This correlation was present in men and women and rural residents for all these cancers but not urban residents for cancers of the esophagus, colon and rectum and liver. Lung cancer mortality showed the strongest inverse correlation with an estimated 12% fall per 10 mW/(nm m(2)) increase in UVB irradiance even if adjusted for smoking. Only incidence rates for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum and cervix were inversely correlated with ambient UVB. Mortality and incidence from nasopharyngeal cancer increased with increasing UVB [respectively 27 and 12% per mW/(nm m(2))]. Mortality from cancer of the cervix also increased, but to a lesser extent and mortality from leukemia was not consistently correlated with UVB irradiance. CONCLUSION: Mortality from all cancers together and most major cancers in China was inversely associated with solar UVB. These associations were similar to those observed in a number of populations of European origin. Incidence of some cancer types had the same correlation with UVB. They suggest the possibility that vitamin D may reduce the incidence or improve the outcome of cancer in Chinese people.","['Chen, Wanqing', 'Clements, Mark', 'Rahman, Bayzidur', 'Zhang, Siwei', 'Qiao, Youlin', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Chen W', 'Clements M', 'Rahman B', 'Zhang S', 'Qiao Y', 'Armstrong BK']","['National Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Cancer Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China. chenwq@cicams.ac.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100616,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)'],IM,"['China/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/prevention & control', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Rural Population', 'Sunlight', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Urban Population', 'Vitamin D']",2010/06/17 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-010-9599-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2010 Oct;21(10):1701-9. doi: 10.1007/s10552-010-9599-1.

As intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accompanies inflammatory reactions in the brain and also because retinoids may suppress activation of microglia, we investigated the effect of Am80 on collagenase-induced experimental model of ICH in adult mice. Daily oral administration of Am80 (5 mg/kg) starting from 1 day before or from up to 6 hours after intrastriatal injection of collagenase significantly inhibited the decrease in the number of striatal neurons at 3 days after the insult. Am80 showed no significant effect on the hematoma size and the extent of edema associated with hemorrhage. Prominent expression of RARalpha was observed in activated microglia/macrophages, and the number of activated microglia/macrophages in the perihematoma region was lower in Am80-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. Am80 treatment also reduced areas affected by hemorrhage-associated oxidative stress as indicated by nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, and attenuated heme oxygenase-1 expression in activated microglia/macrophages. Moreover, Am80-treated mice exhibited better recovery from hemorrhage-induced neurologic deficits than vehicle-treated mice. These results suggest that RAR is a promising target of neuroprotective therapy for ICH.","['Matsushita, Hideaki', 'Hijioka, Masanori', 'Hisatsune, Akinori', 'Isohama, Yoichiro', 'Shudo, Koichi', 'Katsuki, Hiroshi']","['Matsushita H', 'Hijioka M', 'Hisatsune A', 'Isohama Y', 'Shudo K', 'Katsuki H']","['Department of Chemico-Pharmacological Sciences, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100616,United States,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,8112566,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Behavior, Animal/drug effects/*physiology', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Body Water/metabolism', 'Brain/pathology', 'Brain Chemistry/drug effects', 'Brain Edema/pathology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/chemically induced/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Collagenases', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Locomotion/drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/metabolism', 'Neurons/*drug effects', '*Neuroprotective Agents', 'Postural Balance/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists', 'Recovery of Function', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*pharmacology']",2010/06/17 06:00,2011/02/04 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jcbfm201080 [pii]', '10.1038/jcbfm.2010.80 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 2011 Jan;31(1):222-34. doi: 10.1038/jcbfm.2010.80.

DNA methylation regulates gene transcription in MDS, and it is hypothesized that azanucleoside therapy induces DNA hypomethylation and re-expression of aberrantly silenced genes in patients with these disorders. A series of clinical trials conducted over the past 5 years has demonstrated the activity of these therapies. Two agents, 5-azacitidine and decitabine, have been approved by the FDA for treatment of MDS. Recently, 5-azacitidine therapy has been shown, for the first time, to prolong survival in patients with MDS. Because the targeting of biologic pathways in MDS is best accomplished by combining agents with complementary mechanisms of action, combinations of azanucleosides with other drugs are being investigated. In this article, we critically appraise the most relevant clinical data reported on the use of azanucleosides for the treatment of patients with MDS.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Santos, Fabio P S', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Santos FP', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

A CD19-specific sctb of this format has previously been shown to be superior to a bispecific single-chain Fv antibody fragment (bsscFv) for the elimination of leukemic B-lineage cells, but corresponding targeted agents for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia are still lacking. For this purpose, both a bsscFv and a sctb specific for CD33 and the trigger molecule CD16 (FcgammaRIII) were produced. The sctb displayed 3.5-fold greater avidity for CD33 than the bsscFv 33xds16, whereas both had close to equal affinity for CD16. In antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) reactions with human mononuclear cells as effectors, both the bsscFv 33xds16 and the sctb induced lysis of tumor cells with half maximum effective concentrations (EC50) in the low picomolar range. It is interesting to note that the sctb promoted equal lysis of human leukemia-derived cell lines at 10 to 200-fold lower concentrations than the bsscFv. Both molecules mediated ADCC of primary patient cells. In conclusion, both the bsscFv 33xds16 and the sctb 33xds16x33 eliminated acute myeloid leukemia cells in ADCC reactions, but the novel sctb format showed significantly greater specific activity.","['Singer, Heiko', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Lanig, Harald', 'Aigner, Michael', 'Stockmeyer, Bernhard', 'Oduncu, Fuat', 'Schwemmlein, Michael', 'Stein, Christoph', 'Mentz, Kristin', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Fey, Georg H']","['Singer H', 'Kellner C', 'Lanig H', 'Aigner M', 'Stockmeyer B', 'Oduncu F', 'Schwemmlein M', 'Stein C', 'Mentz K', 'Mackensen A', 'Fey GH']","['Computer-Chemie-Centrum, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Stability', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/12/25 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181dda225 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2010 Jul-Aug;33(6):599-608. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181dda225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that EPO acts cytoprotectively for many cell lines against many toxic causes in vitro and in vivo. Our aim was to study the action of EPO on DNA of two cell types, human lymphocytes in vitro and on P388 ascites tumor cells inoculated in BDF1 mice in the presence and absence of the genotoxic agent mitomycin C (MMC). METHOD: The sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay was used as it is a very sensitive, simple and rapid method for detecting DNA damage. Proliferation rate indices (PRI) and mitotic indices (MI) were also counted. RESULTS: EPO did not alter the SCE level when it acted alone on both cell lines. MMC as a potent genotoxic agent increased SCE levels in vitro and in vivo. EPO used in combination with MMC significantly decreased SCE levels and increased PRI and MI values induced by MMC alone both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: EPO acts protectively against the genotoxic potential of MMC, and this action may have clinical implications.","['Digkas, E N', 'Chrisafi, S', 'Passadaki, T', 'Tsalkidis, A', 'Hatzimichail, A', 'Vargemezis, V', 'Lialiaris, T S']","['Digkas EN', 'Chrisafi S', 'Passadaki T', 'Tsalkidis A', 'Hatzimichail A', 'Vargemezis V', 'Lialiaris TS']","['Department of Genetics, Demokrition University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20100616,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Drug Combinations', 'Erythropoietin/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia P388/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects/physiology', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/17 06:00,2011/03/09 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2009/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['000316849 [pii]', '10.1159/000316849 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2010;56(3):239-47. doi: 10.1159/000316849.

One possible consequence of this is that attitudes towards people with certain types of cancer could become increasingly negative. In this study, we assessed attributions of blame for five common cancers. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a population-based survey of women's attitudes to cancer. A sample of 1,620 women rated how much they would blame someone who had a diagnosis of breast cancer, cervical cancer, bowel cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, as well as chlamydia and obesity. RESULTS: Few women attributed any blame for someone with leukemia or breast cancer (9% and 15%). The proportions attributing some blame for bowel cancer and cervical cancer were slightly higher (23% and 37%). Patients with lung cancer were considered at least partly to blame by 70% of respondents, approaching chlamydia (87%) and obesity (96%). Attributions of blame for bowel, cervical, and lung cancer were most common among those with more qualifications, and women who knew that cervical cancer was linked to sexual activity were more likely to attribute blame to it (48% versus 32%). CONCLUSIONS: Cancers are not generally seen as a matter of personal responsibility, but lung cancer, and to a lesser extent, cervical and bowel cancer do attract blame attributions. Knowledge of the preventability of cancer seems to be associated with perceived responsibility. IMPACT: Increasing awareness of the preventable nature of some cancers might affect blame attributions. Additional research is needed to explore the implications of these findings.","['Marlow, Laura A V', 'Waller, Jo', 'Wardle, Jane']","['Marlow LA', 'Waller J', 'Wardle J']","['Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E6BT, United Kingdom. l.marlow@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100615,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology/prevention & control/*psychology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-09-1298 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-1298 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Jul;19(7):1799-805. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-1298.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: The authors carried out a prospective study. The authors included all parents whose consent was sought for their child to participate in the FRALLE 2000A protocol (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) at two centres. The parents were questioned twice by a qualified psychologist using a semidirected interview, 1 and 6 months after consent was sought. RESULTS: 43 first interviews were carried out. All the parents declared they were satisfied with the explanations provided by the physician. 35 (81%) parents felt that the information provided with the request for consent was appropriate. Eight (19%) parents did not realise that their child had been included in a research protocol. 16 (39%) parents did not understand the concept of randomisation. Half the parents could explain neither the aim of the clinical trial nor the potential benefit of inclusion to their child. Only one third of the parents were aware that they had an alternative. The principal factor underlying their decision, as stated by 29 parents (67%), was confidence in the medical team. CONCLUSIONS: The parents signed consent forms without having fully understood all the elements specific to the experimental protocol. Rather, the parents based their decision on their confidence in the medical team, even when their child's life was at risk.","['Chappuy, H', 'Baruchel, A', 'Leverger, G', 'Oudot, C', 'Brethon, B', 'Haouy, S', 'Auvrignon, A', 'Davous, D', 'Doz, F', 'Treluyer, J M']","['Chappuy H', 'Baruchel A', 'Leverger G', 'Oudot C', 'Brethon B', 'Haouy S', 'Auvrignon A', 'Davous D', 'Doz F', 'Treluyer JM']","[""Service d'Urgences Pediatriques, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, 149 rue de Sevres, 75743 Paris Cedex 15, France. helene.chappuy@nck.aphp.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100615,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Comprehension', 'Consumer Behavior/statistics & numerical data', 'Decision Making', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Informed Consent/*psychology', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['adc.2009.180695 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2009.180695 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2010 Oct;95(10):800-4. doi: 10.1136/adc.2009.180695.

Although juxtamembrane mutations commonly detected in gastrointestinal stromal tumor are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the kinase domain mutations frequently encountered in systemic mastocytosis and AML confer resistance and are largely unresponsive to targeted inhibition by the existing agent imatinib. In this study, we show that myeloid cells expressing activated c-KIT mutants that are imatinib sensitive (V560G) or imatinib resistant (D816V) can inhibit the tumor suppressor activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This effect was associated with the reduced expression of PP2A structural (A) and regulatory subunits (B55alpha, B56alpha, B56gamma, and B56delta). Overexpression of PP2A-Aalpha in D816V c-KIT cells induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation. In addition, pharmacologic activation of PP2A by FTY720 reduced proliferation, inhibited clonogenic potential, and induced apoptosis of mutant c-KIT(+) cells, while having no effect on wild-type c-KIT cells or empty vector controls. FTY720 treatment caused the dephosphorylation of the D816V c-KIT receptor and its downstream signaling targets pAkt, pSTAT5, and pERK1/2. Additionally, in vivo administration of FTY720 delayed the growth of V560G and D816V c-KIT tumors, inhibited splenic and bone marrow infiltration, and prolonged survival. Our findings show that PP2A inhibition is essential for c-KIT-mediated tumorigenesis, and that reactivating PP2A may offer an attractive strategy to treat drug-resistant c-KIT(+) cancers.","['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Smith, Amanda M', 'McDougall, Fiona', 'Carpenter, Helen', 'Horan, Martin', 'Neviani, Paolo', 'Powell, Jason A', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Guthridge, Mark A', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Sim, Alistair T R', 'Ashman, Leonie K', 'Verrills, Nicole M']","['Roberts KG', 'Smith AM', 'McDougall F', 'Carpenter H', 'Horan M', 'Neviani P', 'Powell JA', 'Thomas D', 'Guthridge MA', 'Perrotti D', 'Sim AT', 'Ashman LK', 'Verrills NM']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20100615,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phosphorylation', 'Propylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2544 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2544 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Jul 1;70(13):5438-47. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2544.

SNP-microarrays are able to measure simultaneously both genotype and copy number (CN) at several Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) along the genome. CN is defined as the number of DNA copies, and the normal is two, since we have two copies of each chromosome. The genotype of a SNP is the status given by the nucleotides (alleles) which are present on the two copies of DNA. It is defined homozygous or heterozygous if the two alleles are the same or if they differ, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is the loss of the heterozygous status due to genomic events. Combining CN and LOH data, it is possible to better identify different types of genomic aberrations. For example, a long sequence of homozygous SNPs might be caused by either the physical loss of one copy or a uniparental disomy event (UPD), i.e. each SNP has two identical nucleotides both derived from only one parent. In this situation, the knowledge of the CN can help in distinguishing between these two events. RESULTS: To better identify genomic aberrations, we propose a method (called gBPCR) which infers the type of aberration occurred, taking into account all the possible influence in the microarray detection of the homozygosity status of the SNPs, resulting from an altered CN level. Namely, we model the distributions of the detected genotype, given a specific genomic alteration and we estimate the parameters involved on public reference datasets. The estimation is performed similarly to the modified Bayesian Piecewise Constant Regression, but with improved estimators for the detection of the breakpoints.Using artificial and real data, we evaluate the quality of the estimation of gBPCR and we also show that it outperforms other well-known methods for LOH estimation. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a method (gBPCR) for the estimation of both LOH and CN aberrations, improving their estimation by integrating both types of data and accounting for their relationships. Moreover, gBPCR performed very well in comparison with other methods for LOH estimation and the estimated CN lesions on real data have been validated with another technique.","['Rancoita, Paola M V', 'Hutter, Marcus', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Kwee, Ivo']","['Rancoita PM', 'Hutter M', 'Bertoni F', 'Kwee I']","[""Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza Artificiale, Manno-Lugano, Switzerland. paola@idsia.ch""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100615,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', '*Gene Dosage', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Uniparental Disomy']",2010/06/17 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/06/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-321 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-321 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Jun 15;11:321. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-321.,,,,PMC2912301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To exert their cytotoxic effect, these prodrugs need to be metabolically activated to (S)G nucleotides and incorporated into nucleic acids. (S)G in DNA can be methylated spontaneously to S(6)-methylthioguanine (S(6)mG) in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-methionine. It was proposed that S(6)mG, owing to its high miscoding potential (pairing preferentially with thymine), may induce cell death by triggering the postreplicative mismatch repair pathway. Understanding the implications of this pathway in the cytotoxic effect of thiopurine drugs necessitates an accurate measurement of the level of S(6)-methylthio-2'-deoxyguanosine (S(6)mdG) in DNA of cells treated with thiopurine drugs. Here we developed a sensitive HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method and measured the level of 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine ((S)dG) and S(6)mdG in genomic DNA of four human leukemia cell lines and one human colorectal carcinoma cell line. Our results revealed that, upon treatment with 3 muM (S)G for 24 h, approximately 10, 7.4, 7, and 3% of guanine was replaced with (S)G in Jurkat T, HL-60, CCRF-CEM and K-562 cells, respectively. However, only less than 0.02% of (S)dG was converted to S(6)mdG in the above cell lines.

METHODS: The authors analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsecondary 9 (SEER-9) database on patients with a primary malignancy (diagnosed before the age of 20 years) between 1973 and 2005 who developed a secondary hematological malignancy. Primary cancer and histological subtype, incidence, risk factors, outcomes, and changes in risk patterns of secondary hematological malignancies were analyzed for 1973 to 1985, 1986 to 1995, and 1996 to 2005. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of observed to expected cancers were calculated. RESULTS: Of 34,867 patients with a histology-confirmed primary malignancy, 111 developed secondary hematological malignancies (median, 44 months). Lymphoma was the commonest primary cancer (n = 47). The main histological subtype of secondary hematological malignancy was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (49%), which had the shortest median latency time and the worst 5-year survival (18% +/- 5.3%; P = .044). Secondary Hodgkin lymphoma had the best 5-year survival (83% +/- 15%). The 5-year overall survival for patients with secondary hematological malignancies was 31% +/- 4.7%. The risk of secondary AML steadily increased from 1986 to 2005, whereas SIRs for acute lymphoblastic leukemia did not change over time. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the second most common secondary hematological malignancy, occurred at a median of 112 months, and its risk steadily increased over time periods. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing secondary hematological malignancies, particularly secondary AML. This risk has continued to rise even in recent years, emphasizing the need to study other factors contributing to secondary hematological malignancies and closely monitor these patients.","['Rihani, Rawad', 'Bazzeh, Faiha', 'Faqih, Nesreen', 'Sultan, Iyad']","['Rihani R', 'Bazzeh F', 'Faqih N', 'Sultan I']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan. rrihani@khcc.jo']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'SEER Program', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25313 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Sep 15;116(18):4385-94. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25313.,,,,,['(c) 2010 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the majority of somatic cells, in which hTERT and telomerase activity are generally silent, normal lymphocytes show transient physiological hTERT expression and telomerase activity according to their differentiation/activation status. During lymphomagenesis, induction of persistent telomerase expression and activity may occur before or after telomere shortening, as a consequence of the different mechanisms through which transforming factors/agents may activate telomerase. Available data indicate that the timing of telomerase activation may allow the distinction of two different lymphomagenetic models: (i) an early activation of telomerase via exogenous regulators of hTERT, along with an increased lymphocyte growth and a subsequent selection of cells with increased transforming potential may characterize several virus-related lymphoid malignancies; (ii) a progressive shortening of telomeres, leading to genetic instability which favors a subsequent activation of telomerase via endogenous regulators may occur in most virus-unrelated lymphoid tumors. These models may have clinically relevant implications, particularly for the tailoring of therapeutic strategies targeting telomerase.","['Dolcetti, Riccardo', 'De Rossi, Anita']","['Dolcetti R', 'De Rossi A']","['Cancer Bio-Immunotherapy Unit, Department of Medical Oncology, CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy. rdolcetti@cro.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100614,United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Telomere/*physiology', 'Telomere Shortening']",2010/06/16 06:00,2012/06/22 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/med.20211 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2012 Mar;32(2):233-53. doi: 10.1002/med.20211.

Out of six such identified miRNAs miR-196b was not only found to be significantly down-regulated in both EB-3 cell line as well as B-cell ALL patients as compared to that found in the corresponding controls, but also had the inherent capacity to down-regulate the highly expressed c-myc gene, a consequence of genetic translocation characteristic of EB-3 cells at both transcriptional and translational level. This phenomenon was in conformity with the observed reciprocal relationship between the expressed genes coding for miR-196b and c-myc in B-cells derived from ALL patients as well as c-myc gene was found to be a putative target of miR-196b as predicted by bioinformatic algorithms. Also down-regulation of c-myc gene was accompanied by decreased expressions of c-myc effector genes coding for hTERT, Bcl-2, and AATF. Based upon these results, we propose for the first time that miR-196b has the inherent capacity to down-regulate the overamplified c-myc gene recognized as a common pathognomonic feature leading to cancer in general and B-cell ALL in particular. Hence miR-196b can be assigned with the tumor suppressor function and can be of therapeutic importance in paving the way toward the treatment of B-cell ALL.","['Bhatia, Suman', 'Kaul, Deepak', 'Varma, Neelam']","['Bhatia S', 'Kaul D', 'Varma N']","['Molecular Biology Unit, Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160012, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100221,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (AATF protein, human)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MIRN196 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computational Biology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Telomerase/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2009/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-010-0406-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2010 Jul;340(1-2):97-106. doi: 10.1007/s11010-010-0406-9.

However, most mAbs-based immunotherapies conducted so far have only considered the blunting of viral propagation and not other possible therapeutic effects independent of virus neutralization, namely the modulation of the endogenous immune response. As induction of long-term antiviral immunity still remains a paramount challenge for treating chronic infections, we have asked here whether neutralizing mAbs can, in addition to blunting viral propagation, exert immunomodulatory effects with protective outcomes. Supporting this idea, we report here that mice infected with the FrCas(E) murine retrovirus on day 8 after birth die of leukemia within 4-5 months and mount a non-protective immune response, whereas those rapidly subjected to short immunotherapy with a neutralizing mAb survive healthy and mount a long-lasting protective antiviral immunity with strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Interestingly, the administered mAb mediates lysis of infected cells through an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. In addition, it forms immune complexes (ICs) with infected cells that enhance antiviral CTL responses through Fc gammaR-mediated binding to dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, the endogenous antiviral antibodies generated in mAb-treated mice also display the same properties, allowing containment of viral propagation and enhancement of memory cellular responses after disappearance of the administered mAb. Thus, our data demonstrate that neutralizing antiviral mAbs can act as immunomodulatory agents capable of stimulating a protective immunity lasting long after the end of the treatment. They also show an important role of infected-cells/antibody complexes in the induction and the maintenance of protective immunity through enhancement of both primary and memory antiviral T-cell responses. They also indicate that targeting infected cells, and not just viruses, by antibodies can be crucial for elicitation of efficient, long-lasting antiviral T-cell responses. This must be considered when designing antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies.","['Michaud, Henri-Alexandre', 'Gomard, Tiphanie', 'Gros, Laurent', 'Thiolon, Kevin', 'Nasser, Roudaina', 'Jacquet, Chantal', 'Hernandez, Javier', 'Piechaczyk, Marc', 'Pelegrin, Mireia']","['Michaud HA', 'Gomard T', 'Gros L', 'Thiolon K', 'Nasser R', 'Jacquet C', 'Hernandez J', 'Piechaczyk M', 'Pelegrin M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, UMR 5535 CNRS, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100610,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2009/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000948 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2010 Jun 10;6(6):e1000948. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000948.,,,,PMC2883599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, frequent mutations of c-CBL have been reported in myeloid neoplasms showing both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, in which most mutations are present in a homozygous state, as a result of allelic conversion in 11q. c-CBL has ubiquitin E3 ligase activity for a wide variety of tyrosine kinases, and thereby, negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling. Accordingly, c-CBL seems to have tumor suppressor functions, loss of which promotes tumorigenesis. On the other hand, once mutated, it is converted to an oncogenic protein and commits to myeloid leukemogenesis through a kind of gain of function causing aberrant signal transduction. The inhibition of mutant CBL protein or signaling pathways that it activates would have a role in therapeutics of myeloid neoplasms with CBL mutations.","['Ogawa, Seishi', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Otsu, Makoto', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Sanada, Masashi']","['Ogawa S', 'Shih LY', 'Suzuki T', 'Otsu M', 'Nakauchi H', 'Koeffler HP', 'Sanada M']","['Cancer Genomics Project, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. sogawa-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100614,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/11/16 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-2341 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2341 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Aug 1;16(15):3825-31. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2341.

Diverse pharmacological activities of LCCs distributed into various plants were summarized. LCCs showed one order higher anti-HIV activity than tannins and flavonoids. Mechanism of anti-HIV activity induction includes the inhibition of HIV adsorption to and penetration into the cells, and inhibition of reverse transcriptase and protease. Limited digestion experiments demonstrated that a phenylpropenoid polymer, but not a sugar moiety, is important for anti-HIV activity. Dehydrogenation polymers of phenylpropenoids without carbohydrate showed higher anti-HIV activity, whereas phenylpropenoid monomers were inactive, suggesting the importance of highly polymerized structure. LCCs inhibited the plaque formation and RNA polymerase activity of influenza virus, and reduced the lethality of virus infection in mice. LCCs inhibited the plaque formation of HSV-1, and oral intake of LCC-vitamin C tablet reduced the symptoms in HSV-1-infected patients. LCCs stimulated the iodination of myeloperoxidase-positive human monocytes, neutrophiles and promyelocytic leukemia that may be involved in the bacterial killing mechanism. LCCs stimulated splenocyte proliferation, and showed both pro- and anti-inflammatory activity in activated macrophage. Preliminary DNA array analysis demonstrated the activation of the signal pathway of chemokine expression via TLR2. The molecular weight, solubility, sterilization method and association with other components during extraction step may produce diverse biological activity of LCCs. Broad and potent anti-viral activity and synergism with vitamin C suggest functionality of LCC as alternative medicine.","['Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Kushida, Tatsuya', 'Oizumi, Takaaki', 'Nakashima, Hideki', 'Makino, Toru']","['Sakagami H', 'Kushida T', 'Oizumi T', 'Nakashima H', 'Makino T']","['Division of Pharmacology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Japan. sakagami@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20100612,England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', '9005-53-2 (Lignin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Complementary Therapies', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lignin/*chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plants/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sasa/immunology/microbiology/virology', 'Signal Transduction']",2010/06/16 06:00,2011/02/23 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0163-7258(10)00116-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 2010 Oct;128(1):91-105. doi: 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.05.004.

The soluble cellular form of FN has a monomer molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa, and generally exists as a dimer of 500 kDa. We have isolated a different form of soluble FN from mouse breast cancer cell line SC115 conditioned medium (CM) and purified it to homogeneity as evidenced by both native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE. It still exhibits a monomeric form of about 250 kDa while its form in the CM is stable and soluble with an apparent tetrameric molecular weight in the range of 800-1000 kDa. This form of FN is a potent cell adhesion factor (AF) that induces adhesion to polystyrene, elongation, spreading, alignment or ""track"" formation, and migration of mouse erythroleukemia cells. Column fractions homogeneous for AF protein were able to stimulate 10% cell adhesion at concentrations of 23 ng/ml and 1.9 ng/cm(2). Purified AF induced 50% cell adhesion at 94 ng/ml and 7.5 ng/cm(2). AF also increased the migration of human aortic smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cells. However, this form of FN differs from other forms as it does not bind tightly to either gelatin or heparin. Studies of this AF should shed light on adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix molecules and on cell migration, both of which are critical in several biological processes such as wound healing, metastasis, matrix formation and structure, and organ development.","['Scher, Barbara M', 'Mistry, Sucharita J', 'Haque, Nasreen S', 'Scher, William']","['Scher BM', 'Mistry SJ', 'Haque NS', 'Scher W']","['Department of Microbiology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100612,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (cell aggregation factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Polarity/*drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Streaming/drug effects', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Fibronectins/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Solubility']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2009/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00298-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.05.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Sep 10;316(15):2402-13. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.05.034.

They occur due to a combination of disease, host and treatment-related risk factors. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been found to be effective and safe in children with ALL during L-asparaginase treatment. At present, whether or not to give primary anticoagulant prophylaxis for TE during induction or reinduction courses to children with ALL is controversial. Our group investigated the use of LMWH as a prophylactic treatment for ALL children with a genetic prothrombotic predisposition. METHODS: Eighty consecutive children with ALL treated between the years 1999 and 2008 were studied. Genetic analysis of factor V Leiden (G1691A) and prothrombin (G20210A) gene mutations were done at diagnosis. LMWH was given once daily subcutaneously at a dose of 1mg/kg, starting with the first dose of L-asparaginase (day 12 of induction, day 8 of consolidation) until one week after the last dose (day 40 of induction, day 25 of consolidation), to patients with inherited thrombophilia stemming from either factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were found to have a genetic predisposition for TE, all of them received prophylactic LMWH. Six of the 80 (7.5%) patients developed thromboembolic events. Three of these six had a prothrombin (PT) gene mutation and received prophylactic LMWH. No TE event occurred in patients with factor V Leiden mutation receiving prophylactic LMWH. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that patients with ALL and PT gene mutation may have a higher risk of clotting complications in comparison to patients with factor V Leiden mutation.

We examined the worldwide experience of etanercept use in pediatric patients and the occurrence of malignancies as reported from clinical trials, registry studies, post-marketing surveillance, and published scientific literature. METHODS: All reports of ""malignancy"" in pediatric patients (including subjects who received etanercept before age 18 and developed a malignancy before age 22) were collected from the etanercept clinical trials database and global safety database using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; v12.0) standardized MedDRA query ""Malignancies"" from 1998 to August 2009. Cases were collected irrespective of treatment indication. All cases were included regardless of exposure to other TNF blockers or other biologics and whether the other exposure was before or after etanercept. RESULTS: A total of 18 potential malignancies were identified: 4 leukemias, 7 lymphomas, and 7 solid tumors. Three of the 18 malignancies remain unconfirmed. No malignancies were reported from clinical trials or the open-label extension studies in any indication in children. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that there does not appear to be an increased risk of malignancy overall with the use of etanercept. Among etanercept-exposed patients aged 4 to 17 years, the estimated worldwide and US reporting rates for lymphoma were approximately 0.01 per 100 patient-years (1 in 10,000 pt-yrs). While the reported rate of lymphoma is higher in pediatric patients treated with etanercept than in normal children, the expected rate of lymphoma in biologic naive JIA patients is currently unknown. The risk of TNF inhibitors in the development of malignancies in children and adolescents is difficult to assess because of the rarity of malignant events, the absence of knowledge of underlying frequency of leukemia and lymphoma in JIA, and the confounding use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.","['McCroskery, Peter', 'Wallace, Carol A', 'Lovell, Daniel J', 'Stryker, Scott', 'Chernyukhin, Nataliya', 'Blosch, Consuelo', 'Zack, Debra J']","['McCroskery P', 'Wallace CA', 'Lovell DJ', 'Stryker S', 'Chernyukhin N', 'Blosch C', 'Zack DJ']","['Amgen Inc,, Thousand Oaks, CA, Seattle WA, and South San Francisco, CA, USA. dzack@amgen.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100614,England,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,Pediatric rheumatology online journal,101248897,,,,2010/06/16 06:00,2010/06/16 06:01,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:01 [medline]']","['1546-0096-8-18 [pii]', '10.1186/1546-0096-8-18 [doi]']",epublish,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2010 Jun 14;8:18. doi: 10.1186/1546-0096-8-18.,,,,PMC2904755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a nonlinear mathematical analysis of irregular neutrophil fluctuation, using iterative data maps, to detect long-term regulation of the neutrophil population. RESULTS: This geometric analysis indicated that variations of this sequence of neutrophil counts followed bounded deterministic dynamics around a fixed low level equilibrium, a situation similar to that previously observed for cultured mouse early bone marrow progenitor cells. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate how the deleterious effect of T-LGL on neutrophils is balanced, over periods of years, by pulses of compensatory neutrophil production, potentially accounting for the commonly observed prolonged indolent course of the disease.","['Wolfrom, C M', 'Levy, V', 'Deschatrette, J']","['Wolfrom CM', 'Levy V', 'Deschatrette J']","[""CNRS-UMR 8080 'Developpement et Evolution', Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay Cedex, France. claire.wolfrom@u-psud.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,,IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neutropenia/etiology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Time Factors']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['CPR678 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2010.00678.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2010 Jun;43(3):326-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2010.00678.x.,,,,PMC6495143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In experimental settings, CSCs are regarded as most effective at tumour initiation in in vivo assays. Since the first isolation of cancer stem cells from acute myeloid leukaemia in 1994, cancer stem cells have been identified in human solid tumours and they have also been found in the established cell lines, based on ability of CSCs to form in vitro colonies of a specific morphology, called holoclones. Our study examined the ability of a mouse sarcoma cell line, derived from a lung metastasis of a BALB/c mouse and established as a stably growing line (L1), to produce holoclones in vitro. We aimed to verify a stemness signature of the holoclone cells. The L1 cell line was found to form holoclone colonies in vitro, which were shown to contain a percentage of CSC-like cells. A fraction of the L1 cells was able to repopulate the original cell line, and presented an increased clonogenic and metastatic potential (18th passage). In addition, MTT assay and flow cytometry of the side population fraction revealed that these cells were more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs than the original cell line, and over-expressed the anti-apoptotic genes, GRP78 and GADD153. We conclude that mouse L1 sarcoma cell line contains CSC-like cells.","['Miloszewska, J', 'Gos, M', 'Przybyszewska, M', 'Trembacz, H', 'Koronkiewicz, M', 'Janik, P']","['Miloszewska J', 'Gos M', 'Przybyszewska M', 'Trembacz H', 'Koronkiewicz M', 'Janik P']","['Cell Biology Department, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland. joannam@coi.waw.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Dedifferentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['CPR671 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2010.00671.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2010 Jun;43(3):229-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2010.00671.x.,,,,PMC6496761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a sufficiently long-time survival has resulted in the increase of several treatment-related late toxicities, little is still known about the incidence of secondary malignancies. In our hospital, 348 patients with esophageal cancer received chemotherapy consisting of nedaplatin and 5-fluorouracil and concurrent irradiation. Median and average follow-up durations were 8 and 21 months (1-92), respectively. Four patients developed leukemia after 19-48 months of follow-up. Two patients were diagnosed with overt leukemia from myelodysplastic syndrome presenting a complex karyotype, including the deletion of chromosome 5 or 7. Notably, one patient showed an additional chromosomal abnormality with t(9;22)(q34;q11). Other patients developed acute myeloid leukemia with t(9;22)(q34;q11) and Burkitt leukemia with t(8;14)(q24;q32). All patients eventually succumbed to leukemia. Platinum and fluorouracil have shown relatively lower risks for secondary malignancies in comparison with alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors. Especially, nedaplatin has never been described to introduce secondary neoplasms. Our report supports the idea that the concurrent administration of radiotherapy with these agents affects the risk of leukemia. Interestingly, rare balanced chromosomal abnormalities were observed in the present cases, thus providing new insights into the leukemogenesis of therapy-related leukemia.","['Mimura, Naoya', 'Tsujimura, Hideki', 'Ise, Mikiko', 'Sakai, Chikara', 'Takagi, Toshiyuki', 'Nagata, Matsuo', 'Kumagai, Kyoya']","['Mimura N', 'Tsujimura H', 'Ise M', 'Sakai C', 'Takagi T', 'Nagata M', 'Kumagai K']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology Division of Gastroenterological Surgery, Chiba Cancer Center, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20100728,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '8UQ3W6JXAN (nedaplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/pathology', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/10/05 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1487 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01487.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Oct;85(4):353-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01487.x.

Higher levels of BAFF were more frequently associated with female gender (P=0.02), younger age (P=0.01), Rai stage 0 (P=0.002), higher platelet count (P=0.005), mutated IgVH disease (P=0.002), higher occurrence of normal cytogenetic profile or presence of 13q deletion (P=0.02), low ZAP-70- (P=0.003), and CD38-expression (P=0.02). Maximally selected log-rank statistic plot identified a serum BAFF concentration of 0.313 ng/mL as the best cut-off (P<0.0001). This threshold recognized two subsets of patients with different TFT (P<0.0001). Because in multivariate analysis soluble BAFF [Hazard ratio (HR), 8.23; confidence Interval (CI) 95%,3.0-22.6, P<0.0001] and mutational status of IgVH (HR=2.60; CI 95% 1.10-6.14, P=0.03) maintained the discriminating power their combined effect on clinical outcome was assessed. When three groups were considered: (1) low-risk (n=93), patients with concordant IgVH(mut) and higher soluble BAFF; (2) intermediate-risk (n=50), patients with IgVH(mut) and low BAFF levels or IgVH(unmut) and soluble higher BAFF;(3) high-risk (n=26), patients with concordant IgVH (unmut) and low soluble BAFF, the 2-yr TFTs were, respectively, 95%, 85%, and 41% (P<0.0001).

One hundred sixty workers in turning and milling shops had direct exposure to sodium nitrite through skin, mouth, and airway because of lack of occupational protective knowledge (study group), whereas 255 workers from other workshops without direct contact with sodium nitrite served as control group. The incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of esophageal carcinoma as well as other malignant tumors in these two groups were followed until the end of 2007. The sodium nitrite exposure time in the study group ranged from 16 to 23 years, with an average of 22.1 years. During 30 years of follow-up, there were 11 esophageal carcinomas and 10 other malignant tumors (4 hepatic cell carcinomas, 3 lung cancers, 2 breast cancers, and 1 leukemia) documented in the study group, while no cancer developed in the control group.

While inhibiting telomerase provides a novel approach to the treatment of many cancers, telomere maintenance can occur in the absence of telomerase activity by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. Therefore, it must be determined if inhibiting telomerase selects for cancer cells that activate ALT. Here, we report that Hep-2 cells that survived anti-telomerase treatments showed sustained proliferation in culture with down-regulated human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and significantly enhanced levels of ALT-specific promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. Analysis of the telomere lengthening kinetics also demonstrated elevated telomeric sister-chromatid exchange (T-SCE) in surviving Hep-2 cells, consistent with their long and heterogeneous telomeres.

Chemoimmunotherapy combinations that include purine analogs, alkylating agents, and monoclonal antibodies have shown the highest response rates to date. Intensive treatment approaches can be associated with poor tolerability that is often characterized by deteriorating immune functions and high infection rates. Treatment with some monoclonal antibodies is often complicated by infusion-related adverse events and increased risk of infections. Several novel agents are currently being investigated for this difficult-to-treat patient population. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets a different epitope from the one targeted by rituximab and, it has shown promising antileukemia activity. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that has shown promising activity in patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, many of whom had poor prognostic features and bulky disease. Encouraging results have been observed with each of these agents individually.

Thirty-three children with newly diagnosed ALL were included in the study and treated according to the FRALLE 2000 protocol. The 'A group' (n = 18) differed from the 'B-T group' (n = 15) by a less intensive chemotherapy, the absence of concurrent prednisone therapy, and different asparaginase administration modalities during the second intensification. Asparagine, asparaginase activity, and anti-asparaginase antibodies were measured in each phase before the next injection of asparaginase. Eighteen percent of children presented a silent hypersensitivity. Most of them were in the 'B-T group' (p = 0.07), and maintained low antibody titers throughout the treatment. Clinical hypersensitivity was statistically more frequent in group A (p = 0.002), and allergy occurred mainly during the second intensification when antibody concentrations were significantly increased. We did not find any significant difference between asparaginase activity or asparagine depletion between the silent hypersensitivity and clinical allergy groups. In all, the results of this study suggest that chemotherapy and corticosteroid therapy associated with asparaginase treatment can lower antibody production and contribute to maintaining a silent hypersensitivity state.","['Strullu, Marion', 'Corradini, Nadege', 'Audrain, Marie', 'Orsonneau, Jean-Luc', 'Bouige, Daniel', 'Thomare, Patrick', 'Vermot-Desroches, Claudine', 'Mansuy, Adeline', 'Legrand, Arnaud', 'Roze, Jean-Christophe', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Mechinaud, Francoise']","['Strullu M', 'Corradini N', 'Audrain M', 'Orsonneau JL', 'Bouige D', 'Thomare P', 'Vermot-Desroches C', 'Mansuy A', 'Legrand A', 'Roze JC', 'Mohty M', 'Mechinaud F']","[""Service d'Onco-Hematologie Pediatrique, CHU de Nantes, Hopital Mere-Enfant, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.494316 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Aug;51(8):1464-72. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.494316.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At power frequencies there is evidence to associate both childhood leukaemia and brain tumours with magnetic field exposures. There is also evidence of the effect of mobile phone exposure on both cognitive functions and the cerebellum. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum are also sensitive to high dose microwave exposure in rats. The present study investigated the effect of exposure to mobile phone on the number of Purkinje and granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male and female Swiss albino mice were housed as control and mobile phone-exposed groups. Pregnant animals in the experimental group were exposed to Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) mobile phone radiation at 890-915 MHz at 0.95 W/Kg specific absorption rate (SAR). The cerebella were processed by frozen microtome. The sections obtained were stained with Haematoxylin-eosin and cresyl violet. For cell counting by the optical fractionator method, a pilot study was firstly performed. Cerebellar areas were analysed by using Axiovision software running on a personal computer. The optical dissectors were systematically spaced at random, and focused to the widest profile of the neuron cell nucleus. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the number of Purkinje cells and a tendency for granule cells to increase in cerebellum was found. CONCLUSION: Further studies in this area are needed due to the popular use of mobile telephones and relatively high exposure on developing brain.","['Ragbetli, Murat C', 'Aydinlioglu, Atif', 'Koyun, Necat', 'Ragbetli, Cennet', 'Bektas, Seyman', 'Ozdemir, Serdar']","['Ragbetli MC', 'Aydinlioglu A', 'Koyun N', 'Ragbetli C', 'Bektas S', 'Ozdemir S']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Medical Faculty, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey. ragbetli@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Fractionation', '*Cell Phone', 'Cerebellum/cytology/embryology/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Optics and Photonics', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Purkinje Cells/*cytology/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553001003734527 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2010 Jul;86(7):548-54. doi: 10.3109/09553001003734527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA from spontaneous, X-ray or neutron-induced mouse tumours were used in Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) with mono- or di-nucleotide repeat markers. Deviations from expected allele size caused by insertion/deletion events were assessed by capillary electrophoresis. RESULTS: Tumours showing MSI increased from 16% in spontaneously arising tumours to 23% (P = 0.014) in X-ray-induced tumours and rising again to 83% (P << 0.001) in neutron-induced tumours. X-ray-induced Acute Myeloid Leukaemias (AML) had a higher level of mono-nucleotide instability (45%) than di-nucleotide instability (37%). Fifty percent of neutron-induced tumours were classified as MSI-high for mono-nucleotide markers and 10% for di-nucleotide markers. Distribution of MSI varied in the different tumour types and did not appear random. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ionising radiation, especially neutrons, promotes the development of MSI in mouse tumours. MSI may therefore play a role in mouse radiation tumourigenesis, particularly following high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) exposures. MSI events, for a comparable panel of genome-wide markers in different tissue types, were not randomly distributed throughout the genome.","['Haines, Jackie', 'Bacher, Jeff', 'Coster, Margaret', 'Huiskamp, Rene', 'Meijne, Emmy', 'Mancuso, Mariateresa', 'Pazzaglia, Simonetta', 'Bouffler, Simon']","['Haines J', 'Bacher J', 'Coster M', 'Huiskamp R', 'Meijne E', 'Mancuso M', 'Pazzaglia S', 'Bouffler S']","['Health Protection Agency-Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Chilton, Oxfordshire, UK. jackie.haines@hpa.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/isolation & purification/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microsatellite Instability/*radiation effects', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*radiation effects', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/classification/*etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Neutrons/*adverse effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'X-Rays/*adverse effects']",2010/06/16 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/06/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553001003734600 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2010 Jul;86(7):555-68. doi: 10.3109/09553001003734600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent progress on research of molecular and cellular genetics of CLL promotes the development of the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for CLL patients. IGVH gene mutation status is the most important prognostic marker for CLL patients. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP-70) can be used as a surrogate marker for IGVH mutation status. CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein promoting B cell activation and proliferation, which can improve the survival of CLL cells and enhance their proliferation, so it also can be used as an independent prognostic indicator for CLL. Chromosome aberrations are found in more than 80% of CLL cases. The most frequent abnormalities are losses of chromosomal material, with deletions in band 13q14 being the most common. The most common gains of chromosomal material are trisomies 12q. Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a non-classical HLA-I gene. Increased expression of HLA-G leads to the malignant progression of CLL, significantly shortens survival, indicating HLA-G might serve as a prognostic marker in CLL.

Beside that, there were 9 cases of 9q- (5.8%), 5 of +8(3.3%),3 of +4(2.0%) and 17 of other chromosome anomalies (11.4%). In the group of t(8;21) with additional chromosome abnormalities, 11 cases (35.5%) were non-M2 AML, higher than that in single t(8;21) group (17.4%)(P<0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the group of single t(8;21) and the group of t(8;21) with single sex chromosome loss(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: t(8;21) translocation is usually accompanied by additional chromosome abnormalities, particularly in M2; while t(8;21) with additional chromosome abnormalities other than sex chromosome loss is more frequently observed in non-M2 AML.","['Mu, Qi-tian', 'Chen, Zhi-mei', 'Lou, Ji-yu', 'Cheng, Yi-zhi', 'Wang, Yun-gui', 'Ni, Wan-mao', 'Wang, Huan-ping', 'Xu, Huan', 'Yu, Yun-biao', 'Jin, Jie']","['Mu QT', 'Chen ZM', 'Lou JY', 'Cheng YZ', 'Wang YG', 'Ni WM', 'Wang HP', 'Xu H', 'Yu YB', 'Jin J']","['Institute of Hematology & Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Key Laboratory of Hematological Malignancies of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in leukemia cells treated with PBS, ZD55, ZD55-IL-24, and an adenovirus carrying IL-24 (Ad-IL-24) were determined by Western blot analysis. Animal xenograft tumor model was established by Mutz-1 cell line.Deparaffinized tumor sections were incubated with anti-CD31, and VEGF antibody, followed by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULT: The GFP-positive cells were 5.1% and 42.3% in Mutz-1 cells treated with ZD55-EGFP vector at MOI of 10 and 100 for 48h, respectively. ZD55-IL-24 treatment resulted in the marked down-regulation of VEGF protein expression and ZD55 inhibited VEGF slightly; however, there was no change observed in the cells treated with Ad-IL-24. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Ad-IL-24 inhibited slightly angiogenesis and ZD55 treatment resulted in significant inhibition of angiogenesis. ZD55-IL-24 treatment almost completely inhibited angiogenesis in tumor tissues.

Here, we investigated expression of Pim-1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and assessed the correlation between Pim-1 level and prognosis of the patients with ESCC. METHODS: Expression of Pim-1 was investigated by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization methods. Kaplan-Meier statistics was used to examine the relationship between levels of Pim-1 and prognosis using log-rank test. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that ESCC tissues appeared strong expression levels of Pim-1 mRNA and protein while the normal esophageal tissues were either negative or showed only weak Pim-1 mRNA and protein levels. In addition, we found that Pim-1 expression was significantly correlated with histology grade, clinical staging, and lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.05), but not related to age and sex (all P > 0.05). Furthermore, the results of survival rates analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that patients with high Pim-1 mRNA and protein expressions had a poorer prognosis than those with the low Pim-1 expression (P = 0.010 and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that Pim-1 may be used as molecular marker for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC.","['Liu, Hong-Tao', 'Wang, Ning', 'Wang, Xin', 'Li, Sheng-Lei']","['Liu HT', 'Wang N', 'Wang X', 'Li SL']","['Laboratory for Cell Biology, Department of Bioengineering of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jso.21627 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2010 Nov 1;102(6):683-8. doi: 10.1002/jso.21627.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using methylation specific PCR (MSP), methylation was detected in one of the SP1 binding sites of the dCK promoter, in most tested cancer cell lines and in patient samples from brain tumors and leukemia. This SP1 site is a 3'GC box, which upon hypomethylation negatively regulates dCK mRNA expression. In conclusion, we developed a new MSP method showing methylation of the 3' GC-box in the dCK promoter region in tumor cells and patient samples.

To bypass drug resistance due to decreased uptake, lipophilic 5'elaidic acid esters were synthesized, elacytarabine (CP-4055, from ara-C) and CP-4126 (from gemcitabine), which are currently in clinical development for solid and hematological tumors. We investigated whether resistance can be induced in vitro, and treated the CEM leukemic cell line with weekly increasing elacytarabine concentrations, up to 0.28 microM (10 times IC(50)). The IC(50) of the resistant CEM/CP-4055 was 35 microM, about 1,000 times that of the wildtype CEM, and comparable to that of CEM/dCK- (deoxycytidine kinase deficient) (22 microM). CEM/CP-4055 was also cross-resistant to Ara-C, gemcitabine and CP-4126 (28 and 33 microM, respectively). A low level of mRNA dCK was observed, and similar to CEM/dCK-, CEM/CP-4055 did not accumulate Ara-CTP after exposure to Ara-C or elacytarabine, which is consistent with a deficiency in dCK. In conclusion, elacytarabine induced resistance similar to Ara-C. This resistance was caused by downregulation of dCK.","['Adema, A D', 'Losekoot, N', 'Smid, K', 'Kathmann, I', 'Myhren, F', 'Sandvold, M L', 'Peters, G J']","['Adema AD', 'Losekoot N', 'Smid K', 'Kathmann I', 'Myhren F', 'Sandvold ML', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""101235-34-1 (5'-oleoyl cytarabine)"", 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/genetics/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['922992015 [pii]', '10.1080/15257771003741166 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2010 Jun;29(4-6):394-9. doi: 10.1080/15257771003741166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two topoisomerase I inhibitory compounds were purified and identified as caffeic acid and quercitrin. Caffeic acid and quercitrin inhibited the activity of topoisomerase I with IC(50) values of about 0.15 and 0.05 mM, respectively. A concentration of 45 microM caffeic acid caused 50% growth inhibition in human leukaemia U937 cells, but not on those of normal fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. However, quercitrin mysteriously stimulated proliferation of U937 and NIH3T3 cells. Caffeic acid-induced cell death was characterised with the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase-3, indicating that this inhibitor triggered apoptosis. The apoptotic induction by caffeic acid was also confirmed using flow cytometry analysis. Because DNA topoisomerase I is an important target for tumour chemotherapy, the present study suggests that caffeic acid, but not quercitrin, may function by suppressing oncogenic disease through the inhibition of cellular topoisomerase I activity.","['Jang, Seok-Young', 'Bae, Jeen-Soo', 'Lee, Yun Ho', 'Oh, Kyeong Yeol', 'Park, Ki-Hun', 'Bae, Young-Seuk']","['Jang SY', 'Bae JS', 'Lee YH', 'Oh KY', 'Park KH', 'Bae YS']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nat Prod Res,Natural product research,101167924,"['0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Houttuynia cordata extract)', '2Y8906LC5P (quercitrin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'U2S3A33KVM (caffeic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caffeic Acids/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*chemistry', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Houttuynia', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Quercetin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology']",2010/06/15 06:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['922908442 [pii]', '10.1080/14786410903339044 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Prod Res. 2011 Feb;25(3):222-31. doi: 10.1080/14786410903339044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further investigations led to a suspicion of a retrovirus as the causative agent for renal neoplasia in budgerigars, but definitive proof has yet to be found. In the present study, 32 budgerigars suspected of having renal neoplasia (based on the clinical presentation) were examined. The objectives were to investigate the use of different diagnostic methods for the ante-mortem diagnosis of this condition and to find more supporting evidence of a retroviral aetiology. The predominant clinical signs observed in budgerigars with renal neoplasia were lameness and absence of deep pain sensation of one leg. Alterations in haematology, plasma chemistry, and urine analyses could not pinpoint the cases of renal neoplasia. Contrast radiography of the intestinal tract proved to be diagnostically more useful compared with plain radiographic studies. Histology confirmed the renal neoplasia as adenocarcinoma. Investigations for virus identification included product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of avian leucosis virus group-specific antigen. Cell cultures and electron microscopy were performed on a limited number of patients. These investigations could find no presence of an exogenous, replicating retrovirus, neither could viral particles be detected by electron microscopy. Based on the current findings, it can be concluded that there is no evidence of retroviral involvement in the occurrence of renal neoplasia in budgerigars.","['Simova-Curd, Stefka A', 'Huder, Jon B', 'Boeni, Jurg', 'Robert, Nadia', 'Hatt, Jean-Michel']","['Simova-Curd SA', 'Huder JB', 'Boeni J', 'Robert N', 'Hatt JM']","['Clinic for Zoo Animals, Exotic Pets and Wildlife, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Zoo/virology', 'Avian Leukosis/diagnostic imaging/genetics/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/isolation & purification', 'Bird Diseases/diagnostic imaging/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Kidney Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/genetics/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Lameness, Animal', 'Male', 'Melopsittacus', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Radiography', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Switzerland']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['922994068 [pii]', '10.1080/03079451003716375 [doi]']",ppublish,Avian Pathol. 2010 Jun;39(3):161-7. doi: 10.1080/03079451003716375.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the possible effects of midkine (MK) gene on the chemotherapeutic drugs efflux, we examined the MK gene expression in 139 B-lineage ALL patients and 15 children with nonmalignant hematological diseases. Meanwhile, we detected the degree of drug accumulation in 30 progressing B-lineage ALL patients and the 15 control individuals (as control). The results showed that the significant statistic difference in MK gene expression was found among the normal group, the complete remission (CR), and progressing B-lineage ALL patients (p < 0.01). In the Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux test, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the leukemia cells was obviously lower than that in normal pre-B cells (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was an evident negative correlation between the MFI and MK mRNA expression (r = -0.869, p < 0.001) but no correlation with the MDR1 mRNA expression (p > 0.05). We concluded that there was powerful drug efflux ability in lymphoblastic leukemia cells with high MK gene expression.

Obese individuals have larger absolute lean body and fat masses than non-obese individuals of the same age, gender and height, which might lead to altered pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents. Data on the impact of body mass on transplant outcome is conflicting. This study included 331 patients (M, 230; F, 101) with 336 allogeneic transplant episodes from two large teaching hospitals in the West Midlands region in United Kingdom. A total of 105 patients had acute myeloid leukaemia, 83 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, three had myeloma, 21 had Hodgkin's lymphoma, 34 had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 19 had chronic myeloid leukaemia, 22 had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 24 had myelodysplasia, seven had T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, six had aplastic leukaemia and seven had myelofibrosis. At transplantation, 40% (N = 133) of the patients had normal and 60% (N = 198) had high body mass index (BMI) with 14% of the patients being obese (BMI >30). After a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 2-79), the mean overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing allograft with normal BMI was 31 months as compared to 39 with high BMI (p:0.06). The mean progression free survival (PFS) in patients undergoing allograft with normal BMI was 33 months as compared to 38 with high BMI (p = 0.13). Of the patients in the high and obese BMI group, 16% developed acute GvHD with 8% grade III-IV and 28% in the normal BMI group with 14% grade III-IV acute GvHD (p = 0.11). Of the patients in the high BMI group, 17% developed chronic GvHD and 30% of the patients in the normal BMI group (p = 0.09). However, higher infection rates and more days of inpatient stay in the first year post-transplant were observed in the high BMI and obese patients, but there was no difference in ITU admissions. This study shows that high BMI and obesity does not adversely impact on either OS or PFS in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation for haematological malignancies, but it does have a significant impact on infection rates and hospitalisation of high BMI and obese patients. We recommend that patients with high BMI should not be excluded from allogeneic transplantation; however, good supportive care and careful patient selection on the basis of comorbidity index should be undertaken in order to avoid the risks from the increased rates of infection.","['Nikolousis, Emmanouil', 'Nagra, Sandeep', 'Paneesha, Shankara', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Holder, Kathy', 'Bratby, Lynn', 'Chaganti, Sridhar', 'Lovell, Richard', 'Milligan, Donald']","['Nikolousis E', 'Nagra S', 'Paneesha S', 'Delgado J', 'Holder K', 'Bratby L', 'Chaganti S', 'Lovell R', 'Milligan D']","['Haematology Department Heart of England NHS trust, Birmingham, UK. emmanouil.nikolousis@uhb.nhs.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100611,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Body Mass Index', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-1001-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Nov;89(11):1141-5. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-1001-6.

We have shown previously that stimulation of B-CLL cells with a CpG-oligonucleotide induces IL-2 high affinity receptors. In our current work, we analyzed the effect of IL-2 on apoptosis in resting B-CLL cells and in our model of activated B-CLL cells (CD25 high cells). IL-2 had modest antiapoptotic activity in resting B-CLL cells. In contrast, IL-2 was much more potent to prevent apoptosis in activated cells. Prevention of cell death was also associated with the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. While only limited regulation of apoptosis controlling proteins was observed in resting B-CLL cells, IL-2 had strong effects on MCL-1, Bcl-xl, and survivin expression and inhibited Bax cleavage in CD25 high cells. Interestingly, expression of Bcl-2 was reduced. Addition of IL-2 to activated B-CLL cells caused rapid phosphorylation of Akt, while IL-2 failed to significantly phosphorylate Akt in resting B-CLL cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt by LY294002 restored sensitivity of activated B-CLL cells to fludarabine. IL-2 might be an important survival factor in activated B-CLL cells and might contribute to disease progression by upregulation of several critical antiapoptotic proteins.","['Decker, Thomas', 'Bogner, Christian', 'Oelsner, Madlen', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Ringshausen, Ingo']","['Decker T', 'Bogner C', 'Oelsner M', 'Peschel C', 'Ringshausen I']","['Third Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. t.decker@lrz.tu-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100611,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-0994-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Nov;89(11):1125-32. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-0994-1.

As physical activity levels are difficult to measure in the general population, we aimed to investigate how physical activity influences cancer risk using a cohort of Norwegian world class athletes. METHODS: The cohort includes 3,428 athletes. Individual questionnaires gave information about physical activity and lifestyle variables until attained age. To elucidate the level of cancer risk, groups of athletes were compared to the general population (external comparisons) and to each other (internal comparisons). RESULTS: A slightly reduced risk of total cancer was observed in the cohort of athletes, but stronger effects were observed for subgroups. The risk reduction was most pronounced for lung cancer and for leukemia/lymphoma. In women, a threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer was observed. CONCLUSION: This cohort of athletes seems to have a reduced risk of cancer. The beneficial association, however, is weak and may be attributed to healthy lifestyle as well as to physical activity. Prolonged strenuous exercise may also increase the risk of thyroid cancer in women.","['Robsahm, Trude Eid', 'Hestvik, Unn Elisabet', 'Veierod, Marit Bragelien', 'Fagerlie, Arne', 'Nystad, Wenche', 'Engebretsen, Lars', 'Tretli, Steinar']","['Robsahm TE', 'Hestvik UE', 'Veierod MB', 'Fagerlie A', 'Nystad W', 'Engebretsen L', 'Tretli S']","['The Cancer Registry of Norway, Institute of Population-Based Cancer Research, Oslo, Norway. trude.eid.robsahm@kreftregisteret.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100611,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Athletes/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Motor Activity', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2010/06/15 06:00,2011/02/08 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-010-9600-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2010 Oct;21(10):1711-9. doi: 10.1007/s10552-010-9600-z.

Here, we show that the ferrocene derivative HUNI 068 is active against cancer cells and overcomes different mechanisms of multiple drug resistance (MDR). METHODS: Proliferation inhibition was determined by using a CASY((R))CellCounter. DNA fragmentation assay and annexin-V/PI binding assays measured apoptosis, and necrosis was excluded by LDH-release assay. Drug-resistant cell lines were generated to test the ability to overcome MDR. By real-time PCR, alterations in gene expression of treated cells were analyzed. The apoptosis pathway was investigated by immunoblotting and measurement of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition. RESULTS: HUNI 068 leads to proliferation inhibition and apoptosis mediation, but only minimal necrosis induction. Healthy leukocytes seem to be less affected than cancer cells. The compound overcomes drug resistance to vincristine and daunorubicin. Independence of p-glycoprotein and Bcl-2 overexpression is probable, and upregulation of the anti-Bcl-2 protein harakiri was seen. Combined treatment with vincristine leads to synergistic effects. In different primary tumor cells, HUNI 068 achieved acceptable effects where tolerance to some conventional drugs was shown. Induction of apoptosis is FADD-independent, but associated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9, indicating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway via mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: HUNI 068 is a promising new compound with activity even against MDR tumor cells. Further investigations into the class of ferrocene-derived agents might reveal compounds with improved activity for a more specific and safe anti-cancer therapy.","['Kater, Benjamin', 'Hunold, Andrea', 'Schmalz, Hans-G', 'Kater, Lisa', 'Bonitzki, Birgit', 'Jesse, Patrick', 'Prokop, Aram']","['Kater B', 'Hunold A', 'Schmalz HG', 'Kater L', 'Bonitzki B', 'Jesse P', 'Prokop A']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Medical Center Charite, Campus Virchow, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. benjamin.kater@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100611,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (HUNI 068)', '0 (Metallocenes)', '0 (Succinates)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'U96PKG90JQ (ferrocene)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Ferrous Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Metallocenes', 'Succinates/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2010/06/15 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-010-0924-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2011 Apr;137(4):639-49. doi: 10.1007/s00432-010-0924-6.

By targeting a single cellular hub, a viral oncogene may gain control over an entire module in the cellular interaction network that is potentially comprised of hundreds of proteins. The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein is a viral hub that interacts with many cellular hub proteins by short linear motifs/molecular recognition features (MoRFs). These interactions transform the architecture of the cellular protein interaction network and virtually reprogram the cell. To identify additional MoRFs within E1A, we screened portions of E1A for their ability to activate yeast pseudohyphal growth or differentiation. This identified a novel functional region within E1A conserved region 2 comprised of the sequence EVIDLT. This MoRF is necessary and sufficient to bind the N-terminal region of the SUMO conjugase UBC9, which also interacts with SUMO noncovalently and is involved in polySUMOylation. Our results suggest that E1A interferes with polySUMOylation, but not with monoSUMOylation. These data provide the first insight into the consequences of the interaction of E1A with UBC9, which was initially described in 1996. We further demonstrate that polySUMOylation regulates pseudohyphal growth and promyelocytic leukemia body reorganization by E1A. In conclusion, the interaction of the E1A oncogene with UBC9 mimics the normal binding between SUMO and UBC9 and represents a novel mechanism to modulate polySUMOylation.","['Yousef, A F', 'Fonseca, G J', 'Pelka, P', 'Ablack, J N G', 'Walsh, C', 'Dick, F A', 'Bazett-Jones, D P', 'Shaw, G S', 'Mymryk, J S']","['Yousef AF', 'Fonseca GJ', 'Pelka P', 'Ablack JN', 'Walsh C', 'Dick FA', 'Bazett-Jones DP', 'Shaw GS', 'Mymryk JS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100614,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (FLO11 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010226 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.226 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Aug 19;29(33):4693-704. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.226.

Here, we investigated if the G(1) cell cycle block associated with monocytic differentiation is modulated by the p53 status of the cells treated with 1,25D, alone or with plant antioxidants carnosic acid (C) or silibinin (S), and a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (SB), a combination (D-C/S-SB) previously shown to enhance differentiation of AML p53null cells. D-C/S-SB enhanced differentiation of OCI-AML3 (p53wt) and as expected HL60 (p53 null) cells, but not of MOLM-13 (p53wt) cells. Conversely, MOLM-13 (p53wt) cells treated with 1,25D and/or D-C/S-SB, resembled HL60 (p53 null) cells in rapid G(1) block, while OCI-AML3 (p53wt) cells showed a delayed G(1) block when treated in a similar way, indicating that there is no relationship between the p53 status and G(1) block. Western blot analysis revealed that 1,25D and D-C/S-SB increased the inhibitory phosphorylation levels MEK-1 (P-Thr286), but decreased the levels of activated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204;Thr185/Tyr187), again without any apparent relationship to the p53 status. Interestingly, the increased levels of p21(Waf1/Cip1) were insufficient to promote a G(1) block in this system, as only cell lines with increased levels of p27(Kip1) and p35Nck5a, an activator of Cdk5, showed a rapid G(1) block. Overall, our data show that the p53-p21 axis is unlikely to have a role in differentiation-associated G(1) block in AML cells with wt p53, and that this block is achieved by several, possibly co-operating but redundant pathways, that include inhibition of MEK-1 by p35Nck5a-activated Cdk5.","['Thompson, Thelma', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Vassilev, Lyubomir', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Thompson T', 'Danilenko M', 'Vassilev L', 'Studzinski GP']","['Roche Research Center, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20100813,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Abietanes/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2010/06/15 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['12366 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.10.4.12366 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Aug 15;10(4):344-50. doi: 10.4161/cbt.10.4.12366.

Autophagy is a conserved self-digestion process that degrades cytoplasmic materials and recycles long-lived proteins and organelles within cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SAHA stimulates autophagy in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, which was evidenced by the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, formation of acidic vesicular organelles, recruitment of LC3-II to the autophagosomes and conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II . Moreover, SAHA treatment upregulated expression of Beclin 1 and Atg7 and promoted formation of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) enhanced SAHA-induced apoptosis. To determine the underlying mechanism of SAHA-induced autophagy, two complementary proteomic approaches (2-DE and SILAC), coupled with ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis are utilized to profile differentially expressed proteins between control and SAHA-treated Jurkat T-leukemia cells. In total, 72 proteins were identified with significant alterations. Cluster analysis of the changed proteins reveal several groups of enzymes associated with energy metabolism, anti-oxidative stress and cellular redox control, which suggested an abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in SAHA-treated Jurkat T-leukemia cells. These observations were further confirmed by ROS chemiluminescence assay. Mechanistic studies revealed that SAHA-triggered autophagy was mediated by ROS production, which could be attenuated by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor. Finally, we illustrated that Akt-mTOR signaling, a major suppressive cascade of autophagy, was inactivated by SAHA treatment. Taken together, our study identifies autophagy as a reaction to counter increased ROS and is thus involved as a cellular prosurvival mechanism in response to SAHA treatment.","['Li, Jingyi', 'Liu, Rui', 'Lei, Yunlong', 'Wang, Kui', 'Lau, Quek Choon', 'Xie, Na', 'Zhou, Shengtao', 'Nie, Chunlai', 'Chen, Lijuan', 'Wei, Yuquan', 'Huang, Canhua']","['Li J', 'Liu R', 'Lei Y', 'Wang K', 'Lau QC', 'Xie N', 'Zhou S', 'Nie C', 'Chen L', 'Wei Y', 'Huang C']","['The State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, P.R.

CBL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a multi-adaptor protein, controls proliferative signalling networks by downregulating the growth factor receptor signalling cascades in various cell types. METHODS AND RESULTS: CBL mutations were screened in 65 patients with JMML. A homozygous mutation of CBL was found in leukaemic cells of 4/65 (6%) patients. In all cases, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of the 11q23 chromosomal region, encompassing the CBL locus, was demonstrated. Three of these four patients displayed additional features suggestive of an underlying developmental condition. A heterozygous germline CBL p.Y371H substitution was found in each of them and was inherited from the father in one patient. The germline mutation represents the first hit, with somatic loss of heterozygosity being the second hit positively selected in JMML cells. The three patients display a variable combination of dysmorphic features, hyperpigmented skin lesions and microcephaly that enable a 'CBL syndrome' to be tentatively delineated. Learning difficulties and postnatal growth retardation may be part of the phenotype. CONCLUSION: A report of germline mutations of CBL in three patients with JMML is presented here, confirming the existence of an unreported inheritable condition associated with a predisposition to JMML.","['Perez, B', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Galambrun, C', 'Ben Romdhane, N', 'Isidor, B', 'Philip, N', 'Derain-Court, J', 'Cassinat, B', 'Lachenaud, J', 'Kaltenbach, S', 'Salmon, A', 'Desiree, C', 'Pereira, S', 'Menot, M L', 'Royer, N', 'Fenneteau, O', 'Baruchel, A', 'Chomienne, C', 'Verloes, A', 'Cave, H']","['Perez B', 'Mechinaud F', 'Galambrun C', 'Ben Romdhane N', 'Isidor B', 'Philip N', 'Derain-Court J', 'Cassinat B', 'Lachenaud J', 'Kaltenbach S', 'Salmon A', 'Desiree C', 'Pereira S', 'Menot ML', 'Royer N', 'Fenneteau O', 'Baruchel A', 'Chomienne C', 'Verloes A', 'Cave H']","['APHP, Hopital Robert Debre, Departement de Genetique; Universite Paris 7-Denis Diderot, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100612,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developmental Disabilities/complications/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', '*Growth Disorders/complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/complications/*genetics', 'Male', '*Microcephaly/complications/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics', 'Syndrome']",2010/06/15 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jmg.2010.076836 [pii]', '10.1136/jmg.2010.076836 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2010 Oct;47(10):686-91. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2010.076836.

UCB transplant is associated with comparatively reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease, robust graft versus leukemia effect, and relatively high incidence of opportunistic infections, three processes in which donor-derived T lymphocytes are known to be predominantly involved. To examine the differential functionality of UCB T cells, CD8(+) T cells specific for the melanoma-associated HLA-A2-restricted Melan-A(26-35) A27L peptide were isolated from HLA-A2(+) and HLA-A2(-) UCB samples and HLA-A2(+) and HLA-A2(-) adult peripheral blood using A2/Melan-A tetramers. In UCB samples, A2/Melan-A(+) CD8(+) T cells were detected at a frequency of 0.04%, were more frequent in HLA-A2(+) UCB, and were polyclonal and mostly naive. Consistent with Ag-driven expansion, the frequency of A2/Melan-A(+) CD8(+) T cells was increased following stimulation with cognate peptide or polyclonal activation, they acquired cell-surface markers reflective of effector/memory differentiation, their TCR repertoire became oligoclonal, and they expressed cytolytic activity and produced IFN-gamma. Although functional properties of A2/Melan-A(+) CD8(+) T cells derived from HLA-A2(+) UCB resembled those of HLA-A2(+) adult peripheral blood, they were more likely to reach terminal differentiation following polyclonal stimulation and produced less IFN-gamma in response to cognate peptide. A2/Melan-A(+) CD8(+) T cells from HLA-A2(-) UCB were poorly cytolytic, produced little IFN-gamma, and were predominantly monofunctional or nonfunctional. These properties of UCB-derived CD8(+) T cells could contribute to the reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease and heightened incidence of opportunistic infections observed following UCB transplant.","['Merindol, Natacha', 'Grenier, Anne-Julie', 'Caty, Martine', 'Charrier, Emily', 'Duval, Arnaud', 'Duval, Michel', 'Champagne, Martin A', 'Soudeyns, Hugo']","['Merindol N', 'Grenier AJ', 'Caty M', 'Charrier E', 'Duval A', 'Duval M', 'Champagne MA', 'Soudeyns H']","[""Unite d'Immunopathologie Virale, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100611,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (MART-1 Antigen)', '0 (MLANA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'MART-1 Antigen', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0902613 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0902613 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Jul 15;185(2):856-66. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0902613.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study in an assisted reproductive unit in a university teaching hospital, including 20 women with hydrosalpinx and 21 women without hydrosalpinx. Endometrial biopsies were performed on day LH+7 or +8. The proportion and density of pinopodes were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. LIF, integrin beta3 and MUC1 were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The proportion and the density of pinopodes were not significantly different between the hydrosalpinx and control groups. The LIF, integrin beta(3), and MUC1 expression were significantly reduced in both glandular epithelial cells and endometrial lumen of the hydrosalpinx group when compared with those of the control group. The expression of integrin beta(3) in stromal cells was also significantly lower in the hydrosalpinx group. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion and the density of pinopodes in the peri-implantation endometrium were not affected by the presence of hydrosalpinx while LIF, integrin beta(3) and MUC1 were significantly reduced in patients with hydrosalpinx.","['Li, Lu', 'Xu, Bu-fang', 'Chen, Qiu-ju', 'Sun, Xiao-xi']","['Li L', 'Xu BF', 'Chen QJ', 'Sun XX']","['Reproductive Medicine Center of The International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100609,Ireland,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",0375672,"['0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Chi-Square Distribution', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Fallopian Tube Diseases/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin beta3/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Mucin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies']",2010/06/15 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-2115(10)00221-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.04.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2010 Aug;151(2):171-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.04.024.

NPM-positive patients usually show a normal karyotype, a peculiar morphologic appearance with frequent monocytic traits and good prognosis in the absence of an associated FLT3 mutation. This report describes the immunophenotypic and genetic characteristics of a consecutive series of NPM-mutated de novo AML patients enroled in the CETLAM trial. Eighty-three patients were included in the study. Complete immunophenotype was obtained using multiparametric flow cytometry. Associated genetic lesions (FLT3, MLL, CEBPA and WT1 mutations) were studied by standardized methods. Real-time PCR was employed to assess the minimal residual status. The most common pattern was CD34-CD15+ and HLA-DR+. Small CD34 populations with immunophenotypic aberrations (CD15 and CD19 coexpression, abnormal SSC) were detected even in CD34 negative samples. Nearly all cases expressed CD33 (strong positivity), CD13 and CD117, and all were CD123+. The stem cell marker CD110 was also positive in most cases. Biologic parameters such as a high percentage of intermediate CD45+ (blast gate) (>75% nucleated cells), CD123+ and FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with a poor outcome. Quantitative PCR positivity had no prognostic impact either after induction or at the end of chemotherapy. Only PCR positivity (greater than 10 copies) detected in patients in haematological remission was associated with an increased relapse rate. Further studies are required to determine whether the degree of leukemic stem cell expansion (CD45+CD123+cells) increases the risk of acquisition of FLT3-ITD and/or provides selective advantages.","['Nomdedeu, J', 'Bussaglia, E', 'Villamor, N', 'Martinez, C', 'Esteve, J', 'Tormo, M', 'Estivill, C', 'Queipo, M P', 'Guardia, R', 'Carricondo, M', 'Hoyos, M', 'Llorente, A', 'Junca, J', 'Gallart, M', 'Domingo, A', 'Bargay, J', 'Mascaro, M', 'Moraleda, J M', 'Florensa, L', 'Ribera, J M', 'Gallardo, D', 'Brunet, S', 'Aventin, A', 'Sierra, J']","['Nomdedeu J', 'Bussaglia E', 'Villamor N', 'Martinez C', 'Esteve J', 'Tormo M', 'Estivill C', 'Queipo MP', 'Guardia R', 'Carricondo M', 'Hoyos M', 'Llorente A', 'Junca J', 'Gallart M', 'Domingo A', 'Bargay J', 'Mascaro M', 'Moraleda JM', 'Florensa L', 'Ribera JM', 'Gallardo D', 'Brunet S', 'Aventin A', 'Sierra J']","['Department of Hematology and Laboratory, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Avda Sant Antoni M Claret 167, 08025 Barcelona, Spain. jnomdedeu@santpau.cat']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100609,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2010/06/15 06:00,2011/03/10 06:00,['2010/06/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00259-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Feb;35(2):163-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.05.015.
