METHODS: We review the major roles of the bone marrow niche in cell proliferation, adhesion and drug resistance. The signaling pathways and major molecular participants in the niche are discussed. We also address potential niche-targeting strategies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: The bone marrow niche supports normal hematopoiesis and affects acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initiation, progression and chemotherapy resistance. DISCUSSION: AML is a group of heterogeneous malignant diseases characterized by the excessive proliferation of hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells. Even with intensive chemotherapy regimens and stem cell transplantation, the overall survival rate for AML is poor. The bone marrow niches of malignant cells are remodeled into a leukemia-permissive environment, and these reformed niches protect AML cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death. Inhibiting the cellular and molecular interactions between the niche and leukemia cells is a promising direction for targeted therapies for AML treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between leukemia cells and the bone marrow niche influence hematopoiesis, leukemogenesis, and chemotherapy resistance in AML and require ongoing study. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these interactions will help identify rational niche-targeting therapies to improve treatment outcomes in AML patients.","['Wang, Andi', 'Zhong, Hua']","['Wang A', 'Zhong H']","[""a Department of Hematology , South Campus Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , South Campus Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180614,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow niche', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy resistance', 'leukemogenesis']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1486064 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):729-739. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1486064.

Thus, we examined the function and mechanism of LIFR in ccRCC. Low LIFR expression correlated with a poor prognosis and an aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover, integrated LIFR DNA and mRNA analysis revealed that promoter methylation and copy number variation contributed to the reduced LIFR expression. LIFR knockdown increased 786-O and Caki-2 cell invasion and migration. Notably, the Hippo pathway was highlighted as a potential downstream target of LIFR, where loss of LIFR inhibited the kinase activity of the pathway and increased the intracellular Yes-associated protein (YAP) level. Conversely, YAP inhibition impaired the LIFR-silencing promotion of cell migration, invasion, and cancer stem cell marker expression. Moreover, drug sensitivity analysis and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database revealed that LIFR-deficient cells had high sensitivity to a YAP inhibitor and to two other anticancer drugs (PHA-665752, PF2341066). Our study revealed that LIFR attenuates tumor metastasis by suppressing YAP expression, suggesting that LIFR may serve as a potential target for ccRCC treatment.","['Lei, Chengyong', 'Lv, Shidong', 'Wang, Hongyi', 'Liu, Chuan', 'Zhai, Qiliang', 'Wang, Shanci', 'Cai, Guixing', 'Lu, Dingheng', 'Sun, Zhen', 'Wei, Qiang']","['Lei C', 'Lv S', 'Wang H', 'Liu C', 'Zhai Q', 'Wang S', 'Cai G', 'Lu D', 'Sun Z', 'Wei Q']","['1 Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '1 Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '1 Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '2 The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '2 The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '2 The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '2 The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '2 The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '2 The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .', '1 Department of Urology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University , Guangzhou, Guangdong, China .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180614,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",['NOTNLM'],"['Yes-associated protein', 'clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'leukemia inhibitory factor receptor', 'metastasis']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2017.4102 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2018 Aug;37(8):659-669. doi: 10.1089/dna.2017.4102.

All 52 P. xylostella bHLH (PxbHLH) genes were classified into correspondent bHLH families according to their orthology with bHLHs from fruit fly and other insect species. Among these 52 PxbHLH genes, 19 have been annotated consistently with our classification in GenBank database. The remaining 33 PxbHLH genes are either annotated as general bHLH genes or as hypothetical genes. Therefore, our data provide useful information for updating annotations to PxbHLH genes. P. xylostella has four stem cell leukemia (SCL) genes (one of them has three copies), two Dys genes, two copies of MyoR, Mitf, and Sima genes, and three copies of Sage genes.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-year-old man presented with weakness, polydipsia, and polyuria for 1 month. DIAGNOSES: NDI was diagnosed with insignificant response to a water deprivation test after stimulation with vasopressin injection. Bone marrow examination combined with immunophenotypic analysis, cerebrospinal cytology, and abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the diagnoses of precursor B cell ALL with renal infiltration. INTERVENTIONS: The patient accepted standardized combination chemotherapy and ultimately had sustained remission, and his polydipsia and polyuria disappeared after 3 days of treatment. The ALL relapsed 1 year later and he received haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) from his father. OUTCOMES: One year later, he again developed NDI, with bilateral renal enlargement because of extramedullary relapse, leading to subsequent death. LESSONS: This case demonstrates unusual early renal involvement in ALL presenting with initial NDI. Interestingly, the NDI returned with the relapse of renal infiltration 1 year after haplo-SCT. This case suggests that NDI was probably secondary to renal leukemic infiltration.","['Li, Dezhi', 'Liu, Qian', 'Feng, Zhifang', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Feng, Saran']","['Li D', 'Liu Q', 'Feng Z', 'Zhang Q', 'Feng S']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan City Department of Endocrinology, Zhucheng Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Zhucheng City, China Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/22 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000011157 [doi]', '00005792-201806150-00077 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Jun;97(24):e11157. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011157.,,,PMC6024069,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that certain lncRNAs have a critical role in the initiation and development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present study, the subtypespecific lncRNAs in AML was identified. Following the exclusion of the subtypespecific lncRNAs, the prognostic value of lncRNAs was investigated and a threelncRNA expressionbased risk score [long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 926, family with sequence similarity 30 member A and LRRC75A antisense RNA 1 (LRRC75AAS1)] was developed for AML patient prognosis prediction by analyzing the RNAseq data of AML patients from Therapeutically Available Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects. In the training set obtained from TARGET, patients were divided into poor and favorable prognosis groups by the median risk score. The prognostic effectiveness of this lncRNA risk score was confirmed in the validation set obtained from TCGA by the same cutoff. Furthermore, the lncRNA risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. As further verification of the independent prognostic power of the lncRNA risk score, stratified analysis was performed by a cytogenetics risk group and revealed a consistent result. The prognostic predictive ability of the risk score was compared with the cytogenetics risk group by timedependent receiver operating characteristic curves analysis. It was revealed that the combination of the lncRNA risk score and cytogenetics risk group provided a higher prognostic value than a single prognostic factor. The present study also performed coexpression analysis to predict the potential regulatory mechanisms of these lncRNAs in a cis/trans/competing endogenous RNA manner. The results suggested that LRRC75AAS1 was highly associated with the target genes of transcription factors tumor protein 53 and ETS variant 6. Overall, these results highlighted the use of the threelncRNA expressionbased risk score as a potential molecular biomarker to predict the prognosis in AML patients.","['Wang, Fangce', 'Tian, Xiaoxue', 'Zhou, Jie', 'Wang, Guangming', 'Yu, Wenlei', 'Li, Zheng', 'Fan, Zhuoyi', 'Zhang, Wenjun', 'Liang, Aibin']","['Wang F', 'Tian X', 'Zhou J', 'Wang G', 'Yu W', 'Li Z', 'Fan Z', 'Zhang W', 'Liang A']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, P.R.

In the present study, data across multiple modalities were integrated to evaluate 579 CML candidate genes, including literaturebased CMLgene relation data, Gene Expression Omnibus RNA expression data and pathwaybased genegene interaction data. The expression data included samples from 76 patients with CML and 73 healthy controls. For each target gene, four metrics were proposed and tested with case/control classification. The effectiveness of the four metrics presented was demonstrated by the high classification accuracy (94.63%; P<2x104). Cross metric analysis suggested nine top candidate genes for CML: Epidermal growth factor receptor, tumor protein p53, catenin beta 1, janus kinase 2, tumor necrosis factor, abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1, vascular endothelial growth factor A, Bcell lymphoma 2 and protooncogene tyrosineprotein kinase. In addition, 145 CML candidate pathways enriched with 485 out of 579 genes were identified (P<8.2x1011; q=0.005). In conclusion, weighted genetic networks generated using computational biology may be complementary to biological experiments for the evaluation of known or novel CML target genes.","['Zheng, Yu', 'Wang, Yu-Ping', 'Cao, Hongbao', 'Chen, Qiusheng', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Zheng Y', 'Wang YP', 'Cao H', 'Chen Q', 'Zhang X']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

However, its molecular mechanisms of action are unclear. Ubiquitin-specific protease 48 (USP48) is a deubiquitinase enzyme that can post-translationally remove ubiquitin molecules from substrates. In the present study, the role of USP48 in ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells was studied. The expression of USP48 decreased following ATRA treatment. Functionally, overexpression of USP48 using electroporation-mediated delivery inhibited the proliferation of APL cells and promoted ATRA-mediated differentiation. The inverse observations were made upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP48. Furthermore, the expression of USP48 was increased in the nucleus upon ATRA exposure for </=24 h, suggesting that USP48 was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, regulation of p65, a substrate of USP48, did not contribute to the downstream mechanism of ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells. In addition, upstream mechanistic studies demonstrated that the expression of USP48 was regulated by microRNA-301a-3p. In conclusion, the present study highlights the function of USP48 in the ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of APL cells and provides a theoretical basis for identifying novel targets for differentiation therapy of APL.","['Li, Lianlian', 'Wang, Yong', 'Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Song, Guanhua', 'Guo, Qiang', 'Zhang, Zhiyong', 'Diao, Yutao', 'Yin, Haipeng', 'Liu, Hongyan', 'Jiang, Guosheng']","['Li L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Song G', 'Guo Q', 'Zhang Z', 'Diao Y', 'Yin H', 'Liu H', 'Jiang G']","['Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong 250062, P.R.

In the present study, the effect of plumbagin on the growth of ESCC cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo. ESCC cells were treated with plumbagin and tested for cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The involvement of STAT3 signaling in the effect of plumbagin was examined. The results demonstrated that plumbagin treatment suppressed ESCC cell viability and proliferation, yet normal esophageal epithelial cell viability was not affected. Plumbagin treatment increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase. Furthermore, plumbagintreated ESCC cells displayed a significantly greater % of apoptotic cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that plumbagin upregulated tumor protein p53 and cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1A (also known as p21), while it downregulated cyclin D1, cyclindependent kinase 4, and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl1. Mechanistically, plumbagin inhibited STAT3 activation, and overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 reversed the plumbaginmediated growth suppression in ESCC cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that plumbagin delayed the growth of ESCC xenograft tumors and reduced STAT3 phosphorylation. Overall, plumbagin was demonstrated to target STAT3 signaling and to inhibit the growth of ESCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it may represent a potential anticancer agent for ESCC.","['Cao, Yan', 'Yin, Xiang', 'Jia, Yiping', 'Liu, Bingyan', 'Wu, Shaoqiu', 'Shang, Mingyi']","['Cao Y', 'Yin X', 'Jia Y', 'Liu B', 'Wu S', 'Shang M']","['Department of Interventional Radiology, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200336, P.R.

PDZ-binding kinase (PBK) [also known as Tlymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK)] is a serine/threonine kinase expressed in proliferative cells and is phosphorylated during mitosis. In this study, the expression and phosphorylation of PBK/TOPK were examined by western blot analysis and RTPCR. We found that PBK/TOPK was upregulated and phosphorylated in HTLV1-transformed Tcell lines and ATLLderived Tcell lines. Notably, CDK1/cyclin B1, which phosphorylates PBK/TOPK, was overexpressed in these cells. HTLV1 infection upregulated PBK/TOPK expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in co-culture assays. The potent PBK/TOPK inhibitors, HITOPK032, and fucoidan from brown algae, decreased the proliferation and viability of these cell lines in a dosedependent manner. By contrast, the effect of HITOPK032 on PBMCs was less pronounced. Treatment with HITOPK032 resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest, and decreased CDK6 expression and pRb phosphorylation, which are critical determinants of progression through the G1 phase. In addition, HITOPK032 induced apoptosis, as evidenced by morphological changes, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with the activation of caspase3, -8 and -9, and an increase in the subG1 cell population and APO2.7-positive cells. Moreover, HITOPK032 inhibited the expression of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (c-IAP2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin and myeloid cell leukemia1 (Mcl1), and induced the expression of Bak and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)1, 2 and 3. It is noteworthy that the use of this inhibitor led to the inhibition of the phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase (IKK)alpha, IKKbeta, IkappaBalpha, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Akt, and to the decreased protein expression of JunB and JunD, suggesting that PBK/TOPK affects the nuclear factor-kappaB, Akt and activator protein1 signaling pathways. In vivo, the administration of HITOPK032 suppressed tumor growth in an ATLL xenograft model. Thus, on the whole, this study on the identification and functional analysis of PBK/TOPK suggests that this kinase is a promising molecular target for ATLL treatment.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180601,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclin B1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Quinoxalines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2018/06/15 06:00,2018/10/23 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2018.4427 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Aug;53(2):801-814. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4427.

However, no information is available about the fine-scale distribution of HTLV-1 infection within Kyushu-Okinawa. To assess the municipal-level distribution of people with HTLV-1 infection in Kyushu-Okinawa, we performed a cross-sectional study using a fine-scale geographic information system map based on HTLV-1 screening test results from the Japanese Red Cross database from September 2012 to February 2014. Of the 881 871 (646 914 male, 234 957 female) screened blood donors, 981 were seropositive for HTLV-1 by confirmatory test. The seroprevalence was 0.11% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10%-0.12%) for all, 0.094% (95% CI, 0.09%-0.10%) for male, and 0.16% (95% CI, 0.14%-0.18%) for female individuals. The sex- and age-specific HTLV-1 seroprevalence varied significantly across municipalities; particularly, the seroprevalence among women aged 50 years was significantly higher than that of men in both the mainland of Kyushu-Okinawa and the satellite island, in all of which the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 was more than 1.2%. These results show that, even in the Kyushu-Okinawa district, there are endemic clusters of HTLV-1 in small areas. This suggests that public health education programs are needed to eliminate new HTLV-1 infection in these areas.","['Sagara, Yasuko', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Morita, Maiko', 'Sagara, Yasuhiro', 'Nakamura, Hitomi', 'Hirayama, Hideaki', 'Irita, Kazuo']","['Sagara Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Morita M', 'Sagara Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Hirayama H', 'Irita K']","['Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Frontier Life Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Faculty of Education, Nakamura Gakuen University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Quality, Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180710,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Blood Donors', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors', '*Topography, Medical', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Japan', '*blood donors', '*fine-scale distribution', '*human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1)', '*seroprevalence']",2018/06/15 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.25239 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2018 Oct;90(10):1658-1665. doi: 10.1002/jmv.25239.

Retrovirus integration is carried out by integrase (IN), a virus-encoded enzyme that forms an oligomeric 'intasome' complex with both ends of the linear viral DNA to catalyze their concerted insertions into the backbones of the host's DNA. IN also forms a complex with host proteins, which guides the intasome to the host's chromosome. Recent structural studies have revealed remarkable diversity as well as conserved features among the architectures of the intasome assembly from different genera of retroviruses. This chapter will review how IN oligomerizes to achieve its function, with particular focus on alpharetrovirus including the avian retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus. Another chapter (Craigie) will focus on the structure and function of IN from HIV-1.","['Grandgenett, Duane P', 'Aihara, Hideki']","['Grandgenett DP', 'Aihara H']","['Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute for Molecular Virology, Doisy Research Center, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. aihar001@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Subcell Biochem,Sub-cellular biochemistry,0316571,IM,"['Animals', '*DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Integrases/genetics/metabolism', '*Rous sarcoma virus/chemistry/physiology', '*Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Integration/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Alpharetrovirus', 'Avian sarcoma/leukemia (ASLV)', 'Betaretrovirus', 'Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET).', 'C-terminal domain (CTD)', 'Catalytic core domain (CCD)', 'Concerted integration', 'Conserved intasome core (CIC)', 'Cryo electron microscopy (EM)', 'Crystal structure', 'D,D(35)E motif', 'FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT)', 'Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)', 'Intasome', 'Integrase (IN)', 'Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75)', 'Lentivirus', 'Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)', 'N-terminal domain (NTD)', 'Preintegration complex (PIC)', 'Prototype foamy virus (PFV)', 'Retrovirus', 'Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)', 'Spumavirus', 'Stable synaptic complex (SSC)', 'Strand transfer complex (STC)', 'Strand transfer inhibitor (STI)']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-10-8456-0_10 [doi]'],ppublish,Subcell Biochem. 2018;88:211-243. doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-8456-0_10.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",,,,,['R35 GM118047/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well-defined eligibility criteria to predict a safe discontinuation up-front are still missing. Relapse is probably due to residual quiescent TKI-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) supposedly transcriptionally low/silent and not easily detectable by BCR-ABL1 qRT-PCR. Bone marrow Ph+ CML CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs were found to specifically co-express CD26 (dipeptidylpeptidase-IV). We explored feasibility of detecting and quantifying CD26(+) LSCs by flow cytometry in peripheral blood (PB). Over 400 CML patients (at diagnosis and during/after therapy) entered this cross-sectional study in which CD26 expression was evaluated by a standardized multiparametric flow cytometry analysis on PB CD45(+)/CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cell population. All 120 CP-CML patients at diagnosis showed measurable PB CD26(+) LSCs (median 19.20/muL, range 0.27-698.6). PB CD26(+) LSCs were also detectable in 169/236 (71.6%) CP-CML patients in first-line TKI treatment (median 0.014 cells/muL; range 0.0012-0.66) and in 74/112 (66%), additional patients studied on treatment-free remission (TFR) (median 0.015/muL; range 0.006-0.76). Notably, no correlation between BCR-ABL/ABL(IS) ratio and number of residual LSCs was found both in patients on or off TKIs. This is the first evidence that ""circulating"" CML LSCs persist in the majority of CML patients in molecular response while on TKI treatment and even after TKI discontinuation. Prospective studies evaluating the dynamics of PB CD26(+) LSCs during TKI treatment and the role of a ""stem cell response"" threshold to achieve and maintain TFR are ongoing.","['Bocchia, Monica', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Sirianni, Santina', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Aprile, Lara', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Sora, Federica', 'Alunni, Giulia', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Puccetti, Luca', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Defina, Marzia', 'Mulas, Olga', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Sica, Simona', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Pacelli, Paola', 'Ferrigno, Ilaria', 'Usala, Emilio', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Raspadori, Donatella']","['Bocchia M', 'Sicuranza A', 'Abruzzese E', 'Iurlo A', 'Sirianni S', 'Gozzini A', 'Galimberti S', 'Aprile L', 'Martino B', 'Pregno P', 'Sora F', 'Alunni G', 'Fava C', 'Castagnetti F', 'Puccetti L', 'Breccia M', 'Cattaneo D', 'Defina M', 'Mulas O', 'Barate C', 'Caocci G', 'Sica S', 'Gozzetti A', 'Luciano L', 'Crugnola M', 'Annunziata M', 'Tiribelli M', 'Pacelli P', 'Ferrigno I', 'Usala E', 'Sgherza N', 'Rosti G', 'Bosi A', 'Raspadori D']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Rome, Italy.', ""IRCCS Ca' Granda - Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit Bianchi Melacrino Morelli Hospital, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, Azienda Ospedaliera Citta della Salute e della Scienza, Torino, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A Gemelli IRCSS Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera S.

This state is known as 'exhaustion' and is often associated with the inefficient control of tumors or persistent infections. In this work, we investigated the role of leukemia cell-derived microvesicles (MVs) in T cell exhaustion. Following incubation with MVs from various sources, all T cell subtypes exhibited the exhaustion phonotype and impaired cytokine secretion in vitro. Mice models also showed the connection between immune checkpoint inhibitors and MV injection. Sequencing and bioinformatics analyses indicated that a number of transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) were attributable to the dysregulation of pathways and exhaustion in T cells. Further work revealed that functional miR-92a-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-126 and miR-182-5p in MVs could be delivered into T cells to induce the exhaustion phenotype. SerpinB2, IL-1beta and CXCL5, which are mediators of the NF-kappaB pathway, were identified as the targets of the miRNAs mentioned above. We demonstrated that leukemia-derived MVs could initiate T cell exhaustion via the progressive temporal delivery of multiple exogenous miRNAs into T cells and the subsequent interaction of these miRNAs with their targets. Therefore, MVs can be expected not only to become new indicators of the T cell status in patients but also to be used as novel targets for personalized patient treatment.","['Cui, Jieke', 'Li, Qing', 'Luo, Mei', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Zhou, Shu', 'Jiang, Lin', 'Shen, Na', 'Geng, Zhe', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Meng, Li', 'Yi, Shujuan', 'Sun, Hui', 'Wu, Feifei', 'Zhu, Zunmin', 'Zou, Ping', 'You, Yong', 'Guo, An-Yuan', 'Zhu, Xiaojian']","['Cui J', 'Li Q', 'Luo M', 'Zhong Z', 'Zhou S', 'Jiang L', 'Shen N', 'Geng Z', 'Cheng H', 'Meng L', 'Yi S', 'Sun H', 'Wu F', 'Zhu Z', 'Zou P', 'You Y', 'Guo AY', 'Zhu X']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.

D-2HG acting as an oncometabolite promotes proliferation, anoikis, and differentiation block of hematopoietic cells in an autocrine fashion. However, prognostic impact of IDH mutations and high D-2HG levels remains controversial and might depend on the overall mutational context. An increasing number of studies focus on the permissive environment created by AML blasts to promote immune evasion. Impact of D-2HG on immune cells remains incompletely understood. Here, we sought out to investigate the effects of D-2HG on T-cells as key mediators of anti-AML immunity. D-2HG was efficiently taken up by T-cells in vitro, which is in line with high 2-HG levels measured in T-cells isolated from AML patients carrying IDH mutations. T-cell activation was slightly impacted by D-2HG. However, D-2HG triggered HIF-1a protein destabilization resulting in metabolic skewing towards oxidative phosphorylation, increased regulatory T-cell (Treg) frequency, and reduced T helper 17 (Th17) polarization.

Further intensification of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is likely not feasible due to the severity of acute and long-term side effects upon normal tissues commonly induced by these drugs. Successful development and implementation of new precision medicine treatment approaches for patients with AML, which may improve leukemia remission and diminish toxicity, is thus a major priority. Tumor antigen-redirected chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapies have induced remarkable responses in patients with relapsed or chemorefractory B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and similar strategies are now under early clinical study in adults with relapsed/refractory AML. However, potential on target/off tumor toxicity of AML CAR T-cell immunotherapies, notably aplasia of normal myeloid cells, may limit broader implementation of such approaches. Careful selection of optimal target antigens, consideration of toxicity mitigation strategies, and development of methodologies to circumvent potential CAR T-cell resistance are essential for successful implementation of cellular immunotherapies for patients with high-risk AML.","['Tasian, Sarah K']",['Tasian SK'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Abramson Cancer Center, 3501 Civic Center Boulevard, CTRB, 3010, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180517,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'clinical trial', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'immunotherapy']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620718774268 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620718774268 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2018 Jun;9(6):135-148. doi: 10.1177/2040620718774268.

We sought to gain insight into age-associated variants in AML through comparison of extensive DNA and RNA-based GP results from pediatric and adult AML. Sequencing of 932 AML specimens (179 pediatric (age 0-18), 753 adult (age >/= 19)) from diagnostic, relapsed, and refractory times points was performed. Comprehensive DNA (405 genes) and RNA (265) sequencing to identify a variety of structural and short variants was performed. We found that structural variants were highly prevalent in the pediatric cohort compared to the adult cohort (57% vs. 30%; p < 0.001), with certain structural variants detected only in the pediatric cohort. Fusions were the most common structural variant and were highly prevalent in AML in very young children occurring in 68% of children < 2 years of age. We observed an inverse trend in the prevalence of fusions compared to the average number of mutations per patient. In contrast to pediatric AML, adult AML was marked by short variants and multiple mutations per patient. Mutations that were common in adult AML were much less common in the adolescent and young adult cohort and were rare or absent in the pediatric cohort.

Thus, there is ongoing demand for novel agents. Approaches targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) have reached the clinical trial stage. CDK9 mediating RNA transcriptional elongation is the evolving pivotal CLL CDK inhibitor target. However, more CDK9 selective compounds are desirable. Here, we describe the CDK9 inhibitor LDC526 displaying a low nanomolar biochemical activity against CDK9 and an at least 50-fold selectivity against other CDKs. After demonstrating in vitro MEC-1 cell line and primary human CLL cell cytotoxicity we evaluated the LDC526 in vivo effect on human CLL cells transplanted into NOD/scid/gammac(null) (NSG) mice. LDC526 administration (75 mg/kg) for 5 days resulted in a 77% reduction of human CLL cells in NSG spleens compared to carrier control treatment. Next, we longitudinally studied the LDC526 impact on circulating CLL cells in the TCL1 transgenic mouse model. LDC526 (50 mg/kg) administration for two days led to a 16-fold reduction of blood CLL cell numbers. Remarkably, residual CLL cells exhibited significantly increased intracellular BCL-2 levels. However, the LDC526 cytotoxic effect was not restricted to CLL cells as also declining numbers of normal B and T lymphocytes were observed in LDC526 treated TCL1 mice. Taken together, our in vivo data provide a strong rational for continued LDC526 development in CLL therapy and argue for the combination with BCL-2 inhibitors.","['Gothert, Joachim R', 'Imsak, Roze', 'Mollmann, Michael', 'Kesper, Stefanie', 'Gobel, Maria', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Scholz, Arne', 'Lucking, Ulrich', 'Baumann, Matthias', 'Unger, Anke', 'Schultz-Fademrecht, Carsten', 'Klebl, Bert', 'Eickhoff, Jan', 'Choidas, Axel', 'Durig, Jan']","['Gothert JR', 'Imsak R', 'Mollmann M', 'Kesper S', 'Gobel M', 'Duhrsen U', 'Scholz A', 'Lucking U', 'Baumann M', 'Unger A', 'Schultz-Fademrecht C', 'Klebl B', 'Eickhoff J', 'Choidas A', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Pharmaceuticals, Drug Discovery, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Pharmaceuticals, Drug Discovery, Berlin, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH (LDC), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH (LDC), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH (LDC), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH (LDC), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH (LDC), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Lead Discovery Center GmbH (LDC), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center (WTZ), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MEC-1 cell line', 'NSG mice', 'TCL1 transgenic mice', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cyclin-dependent kinase 9']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25293 [doi]', '25293 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 29;9(41):26353-26369. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25293. eCollection 2018 May 29.,,,PMC5995184,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of the efficiency of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; Imatinib), other strategies are explored to eliminate CML leukemia stem cells, such as calcium pathways. Results: In this work, we showed that Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) and thrombin induced calcium influx were decreased in Bcr-Abl expressing 32d cells (32d-p210). The 32d-p210 cells showed modified Orai1/STIM1 ratio and reduced TRPC1 expression that could explain SOCE reduction. Decrease in SOCE and thrombin induced calcium entry was associated to reduced Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) nucleus translocation in 32d-p210 cells. We demonstrated that SOCE blockers enhanced cell mobility of 32d-p210 cells and reduced the proliferation rate in both 32d cell lines. TKI treatment slightly reduced the thrombin-induced response, but imatinib restored SOCE to the wild type level. Bcr-Abl is also known to deregulate Protein Kinase C (PKC), which was described to modulate calcium entries. We showed that PKC enhances SOCE and thrombin induced calcium entries in control cells while this effect is lost in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Conclusion: The tyrosine kinase activity seems to regulate calcium entries probably not directly but through a global cellular reorganization involving a PKC pathway. Altogether, calcium entries are deregulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and could represent an interesting therapeutic target in combination with TKI.","['Cabanas, Helene', 'Harnois, Thomas', 'Magaud, Christophe', 'Cousin, Laetitia', 'Constantin, Bruno', 'Bourmeyster, Nicolas', 'Deliot, Nadine']","['Cabanas H', 'Harnois T', 'Magaud C', 'Cousin L', 'Constantin B', 'Bourmeyster N', 'Deliot N']","['Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Calcium et Microenvironnement des Cellules Souches (CMCS), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Calcium et Microenvironnement des Cellules Souches (CMCS), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Transferts Ioniques et Rythmicite Cardiaque (TIRC), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Calcium et Microenvironnement des Cellules Souches (CMCS), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Calcium et Microenvironnement des Cellules Souches (CMCS), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Calcium et Microenvironnement des Cellules Souches (CMCS), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.', 'Laboratoire de Signalisation et Transports Ioniques Membranaires (STIM) ERL CNRS 7368, Equipe Calcium et Microenvironnement des Cellules Souches (CMCS), Universite de Poitiers, 86073 Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['STIM1/Orai1/TRPC1', 'calcium homeostasis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'leukemogenesis', 'store-operated calcium entry']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25241 [doi]', '25241 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 29;9(41):26309-26327. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25241. eCollection 2018 May 29.,,,PMC5995172,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors disclose no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we developed an ex vivo model with the aim of reproducing the effects of the microenvironment that would help shed light on the in vivo mechanism of action of idelalisib and ibrutinib and predict their clinical efficacy in individual patients. First we explored the effects of various cell-extrinsic elements on CLL apoptosis and proliferation and found that the combination of CpG+IL2+HS5 stromal cell line + human serum +CLL plasma and erythrocyte fractions represented the best co-culture conditions to test the effects of the novel inhibitors. Then, using this assay, we investigated the impact of idelalisib and ibrutinib on both survival and proliferation in 30 CLL patients. While both drugs had a limited direct pro-apoptotic activity, a potent inhibition of proliferation was achieved at clinically achievable concentrations. Notably, up to 10% of CLL cells still proliferated even at the highest concentrations, likely mirroring the known difficulty to achieve complete responses in vivo. Altogether, this novel assay represents an appropriate ex vivo drug testing system to potentially predict the clinical response to novel inhibitors in particular by quantifying the antiproliferative effect.","['Primo, Daniel', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Xochelli, Aliki', 'Mattsson, Mattias', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Espinosa, Ana Belen', 'Robles, Alicia', 'Gorrochategui, Julian', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Gil, Alberto Chaparro', 'Anguita, Eduardo', 'Iraheta, Sandra', 'Munugalavadla, Veerendra', 'Queva, Christophe', 'Tannheimer, Stacey', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Ballesteros, Joan', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Primo D', 'Scarfo L', 'Xochelli A', 'Mattsson M', 'Ranghetti P', 'Espinosa AB', 'Robles A', 'Gorrochategui J', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'de la Serna J', 'Gonzalez M', 'Gil AC', 'Anguita E', 'Iraheta S', 'Munugalavadla V', 'Queva C', 'Tannheimer S', 'Rosenquist R', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ballesteros J', 'Ghia P']","['Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL and B Cell Neoplasia Unit, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL and B Cell Neoplasia Unit, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, IBSAL-Hospital Universitario, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC)- IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology and Hemotherapy, Hospital Universitario de Canarias, La Laguna, Spain.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL and B Cell Neoplasia Unit, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180525,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ibrutinib', 'antiproliferative', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ex vivo', 'idelalisib']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2017/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25419 [doi]', '25419 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 25;9(40):26019-26031. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25419. eCollection 2018 May 25.,,,PMC5995261,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST KS receives unrestricted research support from Gilead', 'Sciences, Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Novartis SA.

Fap1 substrates include Fas and Gsk3beta, suggesting a role in regulating cell survival. Consistent with this, increased Fap1 expression is associated with resistance to Fas or platinum induced apoptosis in some human colon cancer tumors or cell lines. In the current studies, we found that Fap1 expression was significantly greater in CD133(+) colon cancer stem cells compared to CD133(-) tumor cells. PTPN13 promoter activity (encoding Fap1) was repressed by interferon regulatory factor 2 (irf2), and expression of Fap1 and Irf2 were inversely correlated in CD133(+) or CD133(-) colon cancer cells. We determined that CD133(+) cells were relatively resistant to Fas or oxaliplatin induced apoptosis, but this was reversed by Fap1-knockdown or a Fap1-blocking tripeptide (SLV). In a murine xenograft model of colon cancer, we found treatment with SLV peptide significantly decreased tumor growth and relative abundance of CD133(+)CD44(+) cells; associated with increased phosphorylation of Fap1 substrates. SLV peptide also enhanced inhibitory effects of oxaliplatin on tumor growth and Fap1 substrate phosphorylation in this model. Our studies suggest that therapeutically targeting Fap1 may decrease persistence of colon cancer stem cells during treatment with platinum chemotherapy by activating Fap1 substrates. In a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia, we previously determined that inhibition of Fap1 decreased persistence of leukemia stem cells during tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Therefore, Fap1 may be a tissue agnostic target to increase apoptosis in malignant stem cells.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Bei, Ling', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Bei L', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago IL, USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago IL, USA.', ""Jesse Brown Veteran's Administration Medical Center, Chicago IL, USA."", 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago IL, USA.', ""Jesse Brown Veteran's Administration Medical Center, Chicago IL, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180525,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fas', 'apoptosis', 'gene transcription', 'phosphatase', 'stem cell']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25401 [doi]', '25401 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 25;9(40):25891-25902. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25401. eCollection 2018 May 25.,,,PMC5995227,,,['I01 CX001864/CX/CSRD VA/United States'],,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No authors have conflicts to report.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the profile of alpha-BSB citotoxicity was evaluated ex vivo in primary mononuclear blood cells isolated from 45 untreated B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. We studied the effects of alpha-BSB by flow cytometric and western blotting techniques with the following findings: (1) alpha-BSB was an effective proapoptotic agent against B-CLL cells (IC50 42 +/- 15 muM). It was also active, but to a lesser extent, on normal residual B cells and monocytes (IC50 68 +/- 34 and 74 +/- 28 muM, respectively; p < 0.01), while T-cells, though not achieving IC50, were nevertheless decreased. (2) Lipid raft content positively correlated with alpha-BSB cell sensitivity, while neither the phenotype of B-CLL cells nor the disease clinical stage did affect the sensitivity to alpha-BSB. (3) Flow cytometry analysis evidenced the induction of pores in mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane after 3- to 5-hour exposure of B-CLL cells to alpha-BSB, leading to apoptosis; in contrast, western blotting analysis showed inhibition of the autophagic flux. Therefore, according to cellular selectivity, alpha-BSB is a cytotoxic agent preferentially active against leukemic cells, while its lower activity on normal B cells, monocytes and T cells may account for an additive anti-inflammatory effect targeting the leukemia-associated pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Consistent with the observed effects on intracellular processes, alpha-BSB should be regarded as a dual agent, both activating mitochondrial-based apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy by disrupting lysosomes.","['Rigo, Antonella', 'Ferrarini, Isacco', 'Bonalumi, Angela', 'Tecchio, Cristina', 'Montresor, Alessio', 'Laudanna, Carlo', 'Vinante, Fabrizio']","['Rigo A', 'Ferrarini I', 'Bonalumi A', 'Tecchio C', 'Montresor A', 'Laudanna C', 'Vinante F']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Cancer Research and Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Cancer Research and Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of General Pathology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of General Pathology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Cancer Research and Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180525,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'treatment', 'alpha-bisabolol']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25398 [doi]', '25398 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 25;9(40):25877-25890. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25398. eCollection 2018 May 25.,,,PMC5995246,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have declared no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a major limitation of the therapeutic application of gamma9delta2T cells is their diversity and regulation through innate co-receptors. In order to overcome natural obstacles of gamma9delta2T cells, we have developed the concept of T cells engineered to express a defined gammadeltaT cell receptor (TEGs). This next generation of chimeric antigen receptor engineered T (CAR-T) cells not only allows for targeting of hematological but also of solid tumors and, therefore, overcomes major limitations of many CAR-T and gammadeltaT cell strategies. Here, we report on the development of a robust manufacturing procedure of T cells engineered to express the high affinity Vgamma9Vdelta2T cell receptor (TCR) clone 5 (TEG001). We determined the best concentration of anti-CD3/CD28 activation and expansion beads, optimal virus titer, and cell density for retroviral transduction, and validated a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade purification procedure by utilizing the CliniMACS system to deplete non- and poorly-engineered T cells. To the best of our knowledge, we have developed the very first GMP manufacturing procedure in which alphabetaTCR depletion is used as a purification method, thereby delivering untouched clinical grade engineered immune cells. This enrichment method is applicable to any engineered T cell product with a reduced expression of endogenous alphabetaTCRs. We report on release criteria and the stability of TEG001 drug substance and TEG001 drug product. The GMP-grade production procedure is now approved by Dutch authorities and allows TEG001 to be generated in cell numbers sufficient to treat patients within the approved clinical trial NTR6541. NTR6541 will investigate the safety and tolerability of TEG001 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.","['Straetemans, Trudy', 'Kierkels, Guido J J', 'Doorn, Ruud', 'Jansen, Koen', 'Heijhuurs, Sabine', 'Dos Santos, Joao M', 'van Muyden, Anna D D', 'Vie, Henri', 'Clemenceau, Beatrice', 'Raymakers, Reinier', 'de Witte, Moniek', 'Sebestyen, Zsolt', 'Kuball, Jurgen']","['Straetemans T', 'Kierkels GJJ', 'Doorn R', 'Jansen K', 'Heijhuurs S', 'Dos Santos JM', 'van Muyden ADD', 'Vie H', 'Clemenceau B', 'Raymakers R', 'de Witte M', 'Sebestyen Z', 'Kuball J']","['Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""CRCINA, INSERM 1232, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'CHU de Nantes, Hotel Dieu, UTCG, Nantes, France.', ""CRCINA, INSERM 1232, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'CHU de Nantes, Hotel Dieu, UTCG, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180530,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,"['*Batch Cell Culture Techniques/methods/standards', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods/standards', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GMP-manufacturing', '*T cell engineering', '*TEG', '*cancer', '*cancer immunotherapy', '*gammadeltaTCR']",2018/06/15 06:00,2018/06/15 06:01,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01062 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 May 30;9:1062. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01062. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,PMC5988845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal post-remissional treatment for isolated extramedullary relapse (IEMR) is still controversial. We collected data of children treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for ALL IEMR from 1990 to 2015 in Italy. Among 281 patients, 167 had a relapse confined to CNS, 73 to testis, 14 to mediastinum, and 27 to other organs. Ninety-seven patients underwent autologous HSCT, 79 received allogeneic HSCT from a matched family donor, 75 from a matched unrelated donor, and 30 from an HLA-haploidentical donor. The 10-year overall survival was 56% and was not influenced by gender, ALL blast immune-phenotype, age, site of relapse, duration of first remission, and type of HSCT. In multivariable analysis, the only prognostic factors were disease status at HSCT and year of transplantation. Patients transplanted in third or subsequent complete remission (CR) had a risk of death 2.3 times greater than those in CR2. Children treated after 2000 had half the risk of death than those treated before that year.

However, the mechanisms underlying remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the role of magnolin in suppressing human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells via activating autophagy and cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. Pre-treatment of cells with specific autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine) or knockdown of endogenous LC-3B by siRNA significantly abrogates magnolin-induced cell cycle arrest. Molecular validation mechanistically shows that magnolin-induced autophagy and cell cycle arrest in CRC cells is correlated with decreased transcriptional levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and we further find that inhibition of LIF decreases phosphorylation level of Stat3 and represses transcriptional expression of Mcl-1. Furthermore, magnolin-induced autophagy and cell cycle arrest suppress the growth of xenograft colorectal tumors without apparent toxicity. Finally, we evaluate the clinical correlation of LIF/Stat3/Mcl-1 in CRC patient tissues. As expected, LIF, p-Stat3, and Mcl-1 levels are high in CRC tissue but are scarcely found in normal colon tissue. High positive expressions of LIF or Mcl-1 are associated with poor prognosis.

This study investigated the associations between clinical features, fungal load, coinfections, histological skin changes, and response to itraconazole in cats with sporotrichosis caused by S. brasiliensis. Fifty-two cats with skin lesions and a definitive diagnosis of sporotrichosis were treated with itraconazole for a maximum period of 36 weeks. The animals were submitted to clinical examination and two subsequent collections of samples from the same skin lesion for fungal diagnosis and histopathology, as well as serology for feline immunodeficiency (FIV) and leukaemia (FeLV) viruses. Thirty-seven (71%) cats were clinically cured. Nasal mucosa lesions and respiratory signs were associated with treatment failure. Cats coinfected with FIV/FeLV (n = 12) had a lower neutrophil count in the lesion. A high fungal load in skin lesions was linked to young age and treatment failure, as well as to a longer time of wound healing, poorly formed granulomas and fewer neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in these lesions. These results indicate that itraconazole is effective, but nasal mucosal involvement, respiratory signs and high fungal loads in skin lesions are predictors of treatment failure that will assist in the development of better treatment protocols for cats.","['de Souza, Elaine Waite', 'Borba, Cintia de Moraes', 'Pereira, Sandro Antonio', 'Gremiao, Isabella Dib Ferreira', 'Langohr, Ingeborg Maria', 'Oliveira, Manoel Marques Evangelista', 'de Oliveira, Raquel de Vasconcellos Carvalhaes', 'da Cunha, Camila Rocha', 'Zancope-Oliveira, Rosely Maria', 'de Miranda, Luisa Helena Monteiro', 'Menezes, Rodrigo Caldas']","['de Souza EW', 'Borba CM', 'Pereira SA', 'Gremiao IDF', 'Langohr IM', 'Oliveira MME', 'de Oliveira RVC', 'da Cunha CR', 'Zancope-Oliveira RM', 'de Miranda LHM', 'Menezes RC']","['Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States of America.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. rodrigo.menezes@ini.fiocruz.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180613,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Cat Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Coinfection/immunology/microbiology/virology', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Female', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/drug effects/immunology', 'Itraconazole/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology/virology', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/immunology/microbiology/virology', 'Skin/immunology/microbiology/virology', 'Sporothrix/*drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Sporotrichosis/*drug therapy/immunology/microbiology']",,,2018/06/15 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-27447-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-27447-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jun 13;8(1):9074. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-27447-5.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)']",,PMC5998065,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3210-0623', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7366-4391', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7670-9225', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9387-8645', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7831-3689', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3689-4109', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1853-3449']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A peptide tool (Bcl-2/IP3R Disruptor-2; BIRD-2) was developed to abrogate the interaction of Bcl-2 with IP3Rs by targeting Bcl-2's BH4 domain. BIRD-2 triggers cell death in primary CLL cells and in DLBCL cell lines. Particularly, DLBCL cells with high levels of IP3R2 were sensitive to BIRD-2. Here, we report that BIRD-2-induced cell death in DLBCL cells does not only depend on high IP3R2-expression levels, but also on constitutive IP3 signaling, downstream of the tonically active B-cell receptor. The basal Ca(2+) level in SU-DHL-4 DLBCL cells was significantly elevated due to the constitutive IP3 production. This constitutive IP3 signaling fulfilled a pro-survival role, since inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) using U73122 (2.5 microM) caused cell death in SU-DHL-4 cells. Milder inhibition of IP3 signaling using a lower U73122 concentration (1 microM) or expression of an IP3 sponge suppressed both BIRD-2-induced Ca(2+) elevation and apoptosis in SU-DHL-4 cells. Basal PLC/IP3 signaling also fulfilled a pro-survival role in other DLBCL cell lines, including Karpas 422, RI-1 and SU-DHL-6 cells, whereas PLC inhibition protected these cells against BIRD-2-evoked apoptosis. Finally, U73122 treatment also suppressed BIRD-2-induced cell death in primary CLL, both in unsupported systems and in co-cultures with CD40L-expressing fibroblasts. Thus, constitutive IP3 signaling in lymphoma and leukemia cells is not only important for cancer cell survival, but also represents a vulnerability, rendering cancer cells dependent on Bcl-2 to limit IP3R activity. BIRD-2 seems to switch constitutive IP3 signaling from pro-survival into pro-death, presenting a plausible therapeutic strategy.","['Bittremieux, Mart', 'La Rovere, Rita M', 'Akl, Haidar', 'Martines, Claudio', 'Welkenhuyzen, Kirsten', 'Dubron, Kathia', 'Baes, Myriam', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Rietdorf, Katja', 'Morciano, Giampaolo', 'Pinton, Paolo', 'Mikoshiba, Katsuhiko', 'Bootman, Martin D', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'De Smedt, Humbert', 'Parys, Jan B', 'Bultynck, Geert']","['Bittremieux M', 'La Rovere RM', 'Akl H', 'Martines C', 'Welkenhuyzen K', 'Dubron K', 'Baes M', 'Janssens A', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Laurenti L', 'Rietdorf K', 'Morciano G', 'Pinton P', 'Mikoshiba K', 'Bootman MD', 'Efremov DG', 'De Smedt H', 'Parys JB', 'Bultynck G']","['Lab.

We show that CDK6 contributes to tumor formation by regulating transcriptional responses in a stage-specific manner. In early stages, the CDK6 kinase induces a complex transcriptional program to block p53 in hematopoietic cells. Cells lacking CDK6 kinase function are required to mutate TP53 (encoding p53) to achieve a fully transformed immortalized state. CDK6 binds to the promoters of genes including the p53 antagonists Prmt5, Ppm1d, and Mdm4 The findings are relevant to human patients: Tumors with low levels of CDK6 have mutations in TP53 significantly more often than expected.Significance: CDK6 acts at the interface of p53 and RB by driving cell-cycle progression and antagonizing stress responses. While sensitizing cells to p53-induced cell death, specific inhibition of CDK6 kinase activity may provoke the outgrowth of p53-mutant clones from premalignant cells. Cancer Discov; 8(7); 884-97.

However, any benefit that they provide is likely context-dependent, for example, applicable only to certain cancers or in combination with specific anticancer drugs. We report that inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) using statins enhances the proapoptotic activity of the B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) in primary leukemia and lymphoma cells but not in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. By blocking mevalonate production, HMGCR inhibition suppressed protein geranylgeranylation, resulting in up-regulation of proapoptotic protein p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). In support of these findings, dynamic BH3 profiling confirmed that statins primed cells for apoptosis. Furthermore, in retrospective analyses of three clinical studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, background statin use was associated with enhanced response to venetoclax, as demonstrated by more frequent complete responses.

AT/BT and FS catalyze the biosynthesis of A/B and Forssman (FORS1) oligosaccharide antigens that are responsible for the distinct blood group systems of ABO and FORS. Using genetic engineering, DNA transfection, and immunocytochemistry and immunocytometry, we have previously shown that the eukaryotic expression construct encoding human AT, whose LeuGlyGly tripeptide at codons 266 to 268 was replaced with FS-specific GlyGlyAla tripeptide, induced weak appearance of FORS1 antigen. Recently, we have shown that the human AT complementary DNA constructs deleting exons 3 or 4, but not exons 2 or 5, induced moderate expression of FORS1 antigen. The constructs containing both the GlyGlyAla substitution and the exon 3 or 4 deletion exhibited an increased FS activity. Here, we report another molecular mechanism in which an amino acid substitution at codon 69 from methionine to threonine or serine (Met69Thr/Ser) also modified enzymatic specificity and permitted FORS1 biosynthesis. Considering that codon 69 is the first amino acid of exon 5 and that the cointroduction of Met69Thr and GlyGlyAla substitutions also enhanced FS activity, the methionine substitutions may affect enzyme structure in a mode similar to the exon 3 or 4 deletion but distinct from the GlyGlyAla substitution.","['Cid, Emili', 'Yamamoto, Miyako', 'Yamamoto, Fumiichiro']","['Cid E', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamamoto F']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, and.', ""Programa de Medicina Predictiva i Personalitzada del Cancer, Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol, Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*genetics', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', '*Blood Group Antigens/genetics', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Forssman Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glycosyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/genetics', 'Transfection']",,,2018/06/15 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018017293 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017293 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 26;2(12):1371-1381. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017293.,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '9013-60-9 (Forssman Antigen)', 'EC 2.4.- (Glycosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (GBGT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.88 (globoside alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase)']",,PMC6020805,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5025-352X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9516-1402', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9690-7034']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced risk stratification and new therapies are needed to improve outcome. Extensive genetic analyses have identified many mutations that contribute to the development of leukemia. However, most mutations occur infrequently and most gene alterations have been difficult to target. Most patients have more than one driver mutation in combination with secondary mutations, that result in a leukemic transformation via the alteration of proteins. The proteomics of acute leukemia could more directly identify proteins to facilitate risk stratification, predict chemoresistance and aid selection of therapy. Areas covered: This review discusses aberrantly expressed proteins identified by mass spectrometry and reverse phase protein arrays and their relationship to survival. In addition, we will discuss proteins in the context of functionally related protein groups. Expert commentary: Proteomics is a powerful tool to analyze protein abundance and functional alterations simultaneously for large numbers of patients. In the forthcoming years, validation of tools to quickly assess protein levels to enable routine rapid profiling of proteins with differential abundance and functional activation may be used as adjuncts to aid in therapy selection and to provide additional prognostic insights.","['Hoff, Fieke W', 'Hu, Chenyue W', 'Qutub, Amina A', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['Hoff FW', 'Hu CW', 'Qutub AA', 'de Bont ESJM', 'Horton TM', 'Kornblau SM']","[""a Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology , Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands."", 'b Department of Bioengineering , Rice University , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Department of Bioengineering , Rice University , Houston , TX , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology , Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands."", ""c Department of Pediatrics , Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA."", 'd Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180706,England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Signal Transduction', '*Translational Research, Biomedical']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia', '*Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA)', '*biomarkers (or) biomarker discovery']",2018/06/15 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14789450.2018.1487781 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2018 Jul;15(7):613-622. doi: 10.1080/14789450.2018.1487781.

Yet, few studies have examined the association of vincristine to fine motor function. PURPOSE: This study will describe the fine motor skills and function of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on maintenance vincristine. METHOD: A prospective case series design assessed manual dexterity and parent-reported fine motor dysfunction of 15 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relation to cumulative vincristine exposure. FINDINGS: Almost half of the participants had below-average fine motor skills compared to age-related norms, and 57% of parents observed functional motor problems in their children. No significant associations were found between vincristine, manual dexterity, and functional motor skills. IMPLICATIONS: Early detection and intervention for fine motor difficulties is suggested. Research with a larger sample is necessary to further explore the association of vincristine and fine motor function in this clinical population.","['Sabarre, Cheryl L', 'Rassekh, Shahrad R', 'Zwicker, Jill G']","['Sabarre CL', 'Rassekh SR', 'Zwicker JG']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Can J Occup Ther,Canadian journal of occupational therapy.

We hypothesized that RAD52-mediated DNA repair remains active in PARPi-treated BRCA-deficient tumor cells and that targeting RAD52 should enhance the synthetic lethal effect of PARPi. We show that RAD52 inhibitors (RAD52is) attenuated single-strand annealing (SSA) and residual homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA-deficient cells. Simultaneous targeting of PARP1 and RAD52 with inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants caused synergistic accumulation of DSBs and eradication of BRCA-deficient but not BRCA-proficient tumor cells. Remarkably, Parp1-/-;Rad52-/- mice are normal and display prolonged latency of BRCA1-deficient leukemia compared with Parp1-/- and Rad52-/- counterparts. Finally, PARPi+RAD52i exerted synergistic activity against BRCA1-deficient tumors in immunodeficient mice with minimal toxicity to normal cells and tissues. In conclusion, our data indicate that addition of RAD52i will improve therapeutic outcome of BRCA-deficient malignancies treated with PARPi.","['Sullivan-Reed, Katherine', 'Bolton-Gillespie, Elisabeth', 'Dasgupta, Yashodhara', 'Langer, Samantha', 'Siciliano, Micheal', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Hanamshet, Kritika', 'Belyaeva, Elizaveta A', 'Bernhardy, Andrea J', 'Lee, Jaewong', 'Moore, Morgan', 'Zhao, Huaqing', 'Valent, Peter', 'Matlawska-Wasowska, Ksenia', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Johnson, Neil', 'Wasik, Mariusz A', 'Mazin, Alexander V', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Sullivan-Reed K', 'Bolton-Gillespie E', 'Dasgupta Y', 'Langer S', 'Siciliano M', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Hanamshet K', 'Belyaeva EA', 'Bernhardy AJ', 'Lee J', 'Moore M', 'Zhao H', 'Valent P', 'Matlawska-Wasowska K', 'Muschen M', 'Bhatia S', 'Bhatia R', 'Johnson N', 'Wasik MA', 'Mazin AV', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig-Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Division of Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35223, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35223, USA.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.

Sites of disease included lymph nodes (4), skin (2), subcutaneous tissue (1) and bone marrow (1). All cases showed monomorphic large cells, some with Hodgkin-like or anaplastic cells. All cases expressed pan T-cell markers and lacked cytotoxic markers; one case showed diffuse PD1 staining. Only one case harbored human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-1 DNA within tumor cells and was classified as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Among 5 HTLV1-negative cases, 3 were classified as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) and 2 fulfilled criteria for ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with diffuse and strong CD30 positivity. We concluded that Treg phenotype may be rarely seen in HTLV1-negative cases, such as PTCL, NOS and ALK-negative ALCL. Our findings expand the spectrum of T-cell lymphomas with regulatory phenotype and suggest that consideration should be given to HTLV1 DNA testing in the appropriate clinical setting to rule out ATLL.","['Ferreira, Cristiane R', 'Zhao, Shuchun', 'Sahoo, Malaya K', 'Pinsky, Benjamin', 'Weber, Jenna', 'Lage, Luis A P C', 'Pereira, Juliana', 'Zerbini, Maria C N', 'Natkunam, Yasodha']","['Ferreira CR', 'Zhao S', 'Sahoo MK', 'Pinsky B', 'Weber J', 'Lage LAPC', 'Pereira J', 'Zerbini MCN', 'Natkunam Y']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Pathology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 01246, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 01246, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 01246, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP 01246, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

The functional importance of this axis is underscored by the severity of disease phenotypes initiated by abnormal HSC function, including myelodysplastic syndromes and hematopoietic malignancies. Major advances in the understanding of transcriptional regulation of primitive hematopoietic cells have been achieved; however, the post-transcriptional regulatory layer that may impinge on their behavior remains underexplored by comparison. Key players at this level include RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which execute precise and highly coordinated control of gene expression through modulation of RNA properties that include its splicing, polyadenylation, localization, degradation, or translation. With the recent identification of RBPs having essential roles in regulating proliferation and cell fate decisions in other systems, there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of post-transcriptional control at the stem cell level. Here we discuss our current understanding of RBP-driven post-transcriptional regulation in HSCs, its implications for normal, perturbed, and malignant hematopoiesis, and the most recent technological innovations aimed at RBP-RNA network characterization at the systems level. Emerging evidence highlights RBP-driven control as an underappreciated feature of primitive hematopoiesis, the greater understanding of which has important clinical implications.","['de Rooij, Laura P M H', 'Chan, Derek C H', 'Keyvani Chahi, Ava', 'Hope, Kristin J']","['de Rooij LPMH', 'Chan DCH', 'Keyvani Chahi A', 'Hope KJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180613,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*RNA regulons', '*RNA-binding proteins', '*cellules souches hematopoietiques', '*cellules souches leucemiques', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*leukemia stem cells', '*post-transcriptional regulation', ""*proteines de liaison de l'ARN"", '*regulation post-transcriptionnelle', ""*regulons d'ARN""]",2018/06/14 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/bcb-2017-0310 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2019 Feb;97(1):10-20. doi: 10.1139/bcb-2017-0310.

In the current study, a COS-1 cell line overexpressing recombinant Buffalo LIF (rBuLIF) was established. The rBuLIF was purified to homogeneity from the total cell lysate of COS-1 cells using a two-step affinity chromatography. The purified LIF was confirmed by western blot and mass spectrometer (MS/MS). Particularly, high-resolution MS has identified the rBuLIF with 73% of sequence coverage with highest confidence parameters and with the search engine score of 4580. We determined the molecular weight of rBuLIF protein to be 58.99 kDa and 48.9 kDa with and without glycosylation, respectively. Moreover, the purified rBuLIF was verified to be functionally active by measuring the growth inhibition of M1 myeloid leukemia cells, revealing a maximum inhibition at 72 hours and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.0555 ng/ml, corresponding to a specific activity of >1.6x10(7) units/mg. Next, we evaluated the effect of rBuLIF on buffalo mammary epithelial cell lines for its role in involution and also identified the IC50 value for BuMEC migrating cells to be 77.8 ng/ml. Additionally, the treatment of MECs (BuMEC and EpH4) displayed significant (P < 0.05) reduction in growth progression, as confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, suggesting its strong involvement in the involution of the mammary gland in vivo. Thus, we conclude that the glycosylated rBuLIF, purified from COS-1 cells was found to be functionally active as its natural counterpart.","['Ali, Syed Azmal', 'Malakar, Dhruba', 'Kaushik, Jai Kumar', 'Mohanty, Ashok Kumar', 'Kumar, Sudarshan']","['Ali SA', 'Malakar D', 'Kaushik JK', 'Mohanty AK', 'Kumar S']","['Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India.', 'Proteomics and Cell Biology Lab, Animal Biotechnology Center, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180613,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Buffaloes/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",,,2018/06/14 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0198523 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-03374 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jun 13;13(6):e0198523. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198523. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,PMC5999108,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9816-4307'],,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome analysis of the bone marrow showed an abnormal karyotype, described as 46,XY,t(18;22)(q21;q11.2)[19]/46,XY[1]. FISH analysis on interphase nuclei revealed an abnormal clone with loss of D13S319 (13q14.3) in 68.0% of the cells examined. Deletion of chromosome 13 is the most common cytogenetic abnormality identified in CLL (approximately 50% of CLL). Recent studies suggest that deletion of chromosome 13q14 in 65% or more nuclei by FISH is associated with an intermediate to unfavorable prognosis in CLL. The t(18;22)(q21;q11.2) present in this case, as well as the t(2;18)(p12;q21), are variants of the t(14;18)(q32;q21); all three are abnormalities in CLL. These abnormalities are found in less than 4% of CLL cases. They are usually present within the context of a complex karyotype in a subset of CLL, but can also be observed in cases of benign lymphocytosis. Herein, we report a t(18;22)(q21;q11.2) in a CLL patient as a sole cytogenetic abnormality by conventional cytogenetics, and with loss of 13q14.3, as determined by FISH.

Prior to the CIS reaction, a target blunt-end DNA was 3' G-tailed by MMLV-RT in the presence of a tailing enhancer, deoxycytidine. In the CIS reaction, the G-tail reacted with a single-stranded DNA carrying a stretch of Cs on its 3' end (termed as GAO for guide adaptor oligonucleotide), and MMLV-RT performed DNA polymerization, starting from the 3' overhang, using the GAO as a template. We could append a given nucleotide sequence of as long as 72 nucleotides, which would be sufficient for various NGS-sequencing platforms. The high efficiency and the unique features of this MMLV-RT activity that enables the labelling of each DNA molecule with a unique degenerate sequence as a molecular identifier has many potential uses in biotechnology.","['Ohtsubo, Yoshiyuki', 'Sasaki, Haruna', 'Nagata, Yuji', 'Tsuda, Masataka']","['Ohtsubo Y', 'Sasaki H', 'Nagata Y', 'Tsuda M']","['Department of Molecular and Chemical Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Chemical Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Chemical Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Chemical Life Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,DNA Res,DNA research : an international journal for rapid publication of reports on genes and genomes,9423827,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*genetics/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Substrate Specificity']",,,2018/06/14 06:00,2019/01/16 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['5035914 [pii]', '10.1093/dnares/dsy018 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Res. 2018 Oct 1;25(5):477-487. doi: 10.1093/dnares/dsy018.,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,PMC6191310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 207 consecutive CML patients treated with imatinib frontline were revised, dividing them in young adults (>20 < 45 years) (YA), middle-aged adults (>/=45 < 65 years) (MA) and elderly (>/=65 years) (EL). RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMolR) were significantly higher in MA compared with YA and EL (P < .001 for CCyR and P = .001 for MMolR). Number of total events was lower in MA (8 [11.1%] vs 21 [34.4%] in YA and 28 [37.8%] in EL, P = .001): no difference was observed for blastic evolution (P = .478). Number of deaths was higher in the EL (12 [16.2%] vs 2 [3.2%] in YA and 0 in MA, P < .001): however, 11/12 deaths in EL were not related to CML. The PFS curve in MA was significantly longer than in YA and in EL (P = .02). The OS curve in EL was significantly shorter than in YA and in MA (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Age at diagnosis influences significantly the course of CML patients treated with imatinib: a possible explanation of the counterintuitive worse course in YA is the delayed diagnosis compared to elderly.","['Latagliata, Roberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Cesini, Laura', 'De Benedittis, Daniela', 'Mohamed, Sara', 'Vozella, Federico', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Campanelli, Melissa', 'De Luca, Maria Lucia', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Quattrocchi, Luisa', 'Loglisci, Maria Giovanna', 'Massaro, Fulvio', 'Canichella, Martina', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Foa, Robin']","['Latagliata R', 'Breccia M', 'Carmosino I', 'Cesini L', 'De Benedittis D', 'Mohamed S', 'Vozella F', 'Molica M', 'Campanelli M', 'De Luca ML', 'Colafigli G', 'Quattrocchi L', 'Loglisci MG', 'Massaro F', 'Canichella M', 'Diverio D', 'Mancini M', 'Alimena G', 'Foa R']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180613,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'imatinib', 'prognosis']",2018/06/14 06:00,2018/06/14 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13110 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Jun 13. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13110.,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7741-862X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4805-9928']",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Yet, no MMP-9 and survivin-modulating drugs with low toxicity on normal cells but high efficacy against high MMP-9- and survivin-expressing leukaemia cells have been approved for clinical application in ALL. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite of Serratia marcescens, induces apoptosis in different kinds of cancer cells with low toxicity on normal cells. However, little is known about the effects of this compound on the high MMP-9- and survivin-expressing leukaemia cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: CCRF-CEM cells as a model for high MMP-9- and survivin-expressing ALL cells were treated with 100, 200 and 400 nmol l(-1) prodigiosin after which cell number, proliferation rate, MMP-9 and survivin expression, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were evaluated.

Treatment with prodigiosin for 48 h decreased MMP-9 mRNA levels followed by decreases in secreted (S) and intracellular (I) MMP-9 protein levels by 20-22% and 69-72% for 100-400 nmol l(-1) prodigiosin respectively. Prodigiosin decreased survivin protein levels from 40 to 26% followed by 3.7-5.6-fold increases in caspase-3 activation for the aforementioned prodigiosin concentration ranges. Treatment with 100-400 nmol l(-1) prodigiosin increased the caspase-3/survivin, caspase-3/I-MMP-9 and caspase-3/S-MMP-9 ratios by 6-7.3-, 11.5-19.1- and 4.9-6.8-fold increases respectively. A dramatic increase in the number of apoptotic cells was also observed with increasing prodigiosin concentrations. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effects of prodigiosin on MMP-9 and survivin expression, as well as its pro-apoptotic capacity, represent a novel therapeutic avenue against ALL cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings provide an important and interesting basis to develop a new therapeutic compound with high potential against ALL cells.","['Sam, M R', 'Ghoreishi, S']","['Sam MR', 'Ghoreishi S']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180718,England,J Appl Microbiol,Journal of applied microbiology,9706280,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Prodigiosin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Serratia marcescens/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Survivin']",['NOTNLM'],"['Serratia marcescens', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'apoptosis', 'caspae-3', 'matrix metalloproteinase-9', 'prodigiosin', 'survivin']",2018/06/14 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jam.13949 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Microbiol. 2018 Oct;125(4):1017-1029. doi: 10.1111/jam.13949.

Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease , which occurs most often in children and young adults in East Asia, is an EBV-associated T-/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Patients with CAEBV often progress to overt lymphoma or leukemia over a long-term clinical course. EBV's transforming capacity in B cells is well characterized, but the molecular pathogenesis of clonal expansion caused by EBV in T/NK cells has not yet been clarified. In the primary infection, EBV infects B cells and epithelial cells and may also infect some T/NK cells. In some individuals, because of poor presentation by specific human leukocyte antigens or the genetic background, EBV-infected T/NK cells evade host immunity and survive. Occasionally, with the help of viral oncogenes, EBV-associated T/NK lymphoproliferative diseases, such as CAEBV, may develop. The subsequent accumulation of genetic mutations and/or epigenetic modifications in driver genes, such as DDX3X and TP53, may lead to overt lymphoma and leukemia. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase and the APOBEC3 family, driven by EBV infection, may induce chromosomal recombination and somatic mutations.","['Kimura, Hiroshi']",['Kimura H'],"['Department of Virology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. hkimura@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology/virology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology/*virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AID', '*CAEBV', '*Chronic active EBV disease', '*DDX3X', '*EBV-T/NK LPD', '*ENKL', '*Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma-nasal type', '*Lymphomagenesis', '*Lymphoproliferative disease']",2018/06/14 06:00,2018/11/21 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-10-7230-7_21 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2018;1045:459-475. doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-7230-7_21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We extend the concepts of physical space and time to an abstract, mathematically-defined space, which we associate with a concept of ""biological space-time"" in which biological dynamics may be represented. We hypothesize that biological dynamics, represented as trajectories in biological space-time, may be used to model and study different rates of biological aging. As a consequence of this hypothesis, we show how dilation or contraction of time analogous to relativistic corrections of physical time resulting from accelerated or decelerated biological dynamics may be used to study precipitous or protracted aging. We show specific examples of how these principles may be used to model different rates of aging, with an emphasis on cancer in aging. We discuss how this theory may be tested or falsified, as well as novel concepts and implications of this theory that may improve our interpretation of biological aging.","['Maestrini, Davide', 'Abler, Daniel', 'Adhikarla, Vikram', 'Armenian, Saro', 'Branciamore, Sergio', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Sahoo, Prativa', 'Rockne, Russell C']","['Maestrini D', 'Abler D', 'Adhikarla V', 'Armenian S', 'Branciamore S', 'Carlesso N', 'Kuo YH', 'Marcucci G', 'Sahoo P', 'Rockne RC']","['Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'City of Hope, National Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'City of Hope, National Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Department of Hematologic Malignancies Translational Science, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'City of Hope, National Medical Center, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope, National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,['NOTNLM'],"['aging', 'biological clocks', 'biological space-time', 'manifolds', 'special relativity', 'time-contraction']",2018/06/14 06:00,2018/06/14 06:01,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2018.00055 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2018 May 29;6:55. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2018.00055. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5986934,,,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA205247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK097837/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a novel oncogene, which plays crucial roles in mitotic progression and stem cell maintenance. OTSSP167, an orally administrated inhibitor targeting MELK, is currently in a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with advanced breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Yet, no investigation has been elucidated to date regarding the oncogenic role of MELK and effects of OTSSP167 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previous studies confirmed MELK inhibition abrogated cancer cell survival via p53 signaling pathway. Thus, we aimed to determine the biological function of MELK and therapeutic potential of OTSSP167 in CLL. Herein, MELK over-expression was observed in CLL cells, and correlated with higher WBC count, advanced stage, elevated LDH, increased beta2-MG level, unmutated IGHV, positive ZAP-70, deletion of 17p13 and inferior prognosis of CLL patients. In accordance with functional enrichment analyses in gene expression profiling, CLL cells with depletion or inhibition of MELK exhibited impaired cell proliferation, enhanced fast-onset apoptosis, induced G2/M arrest, attenuated cell chemotaxis and promoted sensitivity to fludarabine and ibrutinib. However, gain-of-function assay showed increased cell proliferation and cell chemotaxis. In addition, OTSSP167 treatment reduced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. It decreased FoxM1 phosphorylation, expression of FoxM1, cyclin B1 and CDK1, while up-regulating p53 and p21 expression. Taken together, MELK served as a candidate of therapeutic target in CLL. OTSSP167 exhibits potent anti-tumor activities in CLL cells, highlighting a novel molecule-based strategy for leukemic interventions.","['Zhang, Ya', 'Zhou, Xiangxiang', 'Li, Ying', 'Xu, Yangyang', 'Lu, Kang', 'Li, Peipei', 'Wang, Xin']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhou X', 'Li Y', 'Xu Y', 'Lu K', 'Li P', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China. xinw@sdu.edu.cn.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China. xinw@sdu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180612,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2018/06/14 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2017/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0333-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0333-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Oct;37(41):5520-5533. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0333-x.

Little is known about clonal selection induced by therapeutic pressure in multiple myeloma. To address this issue, we performed large targeted sequencing of bone marrow plasma cells in 43 multiple myeloma patients at diagnosis and at relapse from exactly the same intensive treatment. The most frequently mutated genes at diagnosis were KRAS (35%), NRAS (28%), DIS3 (16%), BRAF, and LRP1B (12% each). At relapse, the mutational burden was unchanged. Many of the mutations were present at the subclonal level at both time points, including driver ones. According to patients and mutations, we observed different scenarios: selection of a very rare subclone present at diagnosis, appearance, or disappearance of mutations, but also stability. Our data highlight that chemoresistance and relapse could be induced by newly acquired mutations in myeloma drivers but also by (sub)clonal mutations preexisting to the treatment. Importantly, no specific mutation or rearrangement was observed at relapse, demonstrating that intensive treatment has a nonspecific effect on clonal selection in multiple myeloma. Finally, we identified 22 cases of biallelic event, including a double event deletion 17p/TP53mut.","['Corre, Jill', 'Cleynen, Alice', 'Robiou du Pont, Sebastien', 'Buisson, Laure', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'Attal, Michel', 'Munshi, Nikhil', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve']","['Corre J', 'Cleynen A', 'Robiou du Pont S', 'Buisson L', 'Bolli N', 'Attal M', 'Munshi N', 'Avet-Loiseau H']","['IUC-Oncopole, and CRCT INSERM U1037, 31100, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Montpellierain Alexander Grothendieck, CNRS, Univ.

Patients were randomized, 2:1, to receive epoetin-alpha 450 IU/kg/week or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by treatment extension in responders. The primary endpoint was erythroid response (ER) through Week 24. Dose adjustments were driven by weekly Hb-levels and included increases, and dose reductions/discontinuation if Hb > 12 g/dL. An independent Response Review Committee (RRC) blindly reviewed all responses, applying IWG-2006 criteria but also considering dose adjustments, drug interruptions and longer periods of observation.A total of 130 patients were randomized (85 to epoetin-alpha and 45 to placebo). The ER by IWG-2006 criteria was 31.8% for epoetin-alpha vs 4.4% for placebo (p < 0.001); after RRC review, the ER was 45.9 vs 4.4% (p < 0.001), respectively.

We used targeted sequencing of genes altered in hematologic malignancies, including DNA coding sequence for 405 genes, noncoding sequence for 31 genes, and RNA coding sequence for 265 genes (FoundationOne-Heme). Short variants, rearrangements, and copy number alterations were determined. We studied 198 samples (114 de novo, 58 previously treated, and 26 large-cell transformation from follicular lymphoma). Median number of GAs per case was 6, with 97% of patients harboring at least one alteration. Recurrent GAs were detected in genes with established roles in DLBCL pathogenesis (e.g. MYD88, CREBBP, CD79B, EZH2), as well as notable differences compared to prior studies such as inactivating mutations in TET2 (5%). Less common GAs identified potential targets for approved or investigational therapies, including BRAF, CD274 (PD-L1), IDH2, and JAK1/2. TP53 mutations were more frequently observed in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, and predicted for lack of response to first-line chemotherapy, identifying a subset of patients that could be prioritized for novel therapies. Overall, 90% (n = 169) of the patients harbored a GA which could be explored for therapeutic intervention, with 54% (n = 107) harboring more than one putative target.","['Intlekofer, Andrew M',

This compound was found to have antiproliferative effects on a variety of solid tumor cell lines, as well as several leukemia cell lines. Other researchers have also noted the cytotoxicity of plagiochiline A (isolated from different plant species), but there are no prior reports regarding the mechanism for this bioactivity. Here, we have evaluated the effects of plagiochiline A on cell cycle progression in DU145 prostate cancer cells. A cell cycle analysis indicated that plagiochiline A caused a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G(2)/M phase when compared with control cells. When cells were stained and observed by fluorescence microscopy to examine progress through the mitotic phase, we found a significant increase in the proportion of cells with features of late cytokinesis (cells connected by intercellular bridges) in the plagiochiline A-treated samples. These results suggest that plagiochiline A inhibits cell division by preventing completion of cytokinesis, particularly at the final abscission stage. We also determined that plagiochiline A reduces DU145 cell survival in clonogenic assays and that it induces substantial cell death in these cells.","['Stivers, Nicole S', 'Islam, Ashraful', 'Reyes-Reyes, Elsa M', 'Casson, Lavona K', 'Aponte, Jose C', 'Vaisberg, Abraham J', 'Hammond, Gerald B', 'Bates, Paula J']","['Stivers NS', 'Islam A', 'Reyes-Reyes EM', 'Casson LK', 'Aponte JC', 'Vaisberg AJ', 'Hammond GB', 'Bates PJ']","['Department of Biology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40208, USA. nsstiv01@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. nsstiv01@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. ashrafulislam01@gmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia. ashrafulislam01@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. emreye01@email.arizona.edu.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. emreye01@email.arizona.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. lavona.casson@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, USA. jose.c.aponte@nasa.gov.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Celulares y Moleculares y Laboratorios de Investigacion y Desarrollo, Facultad de Ciencias y Filosofia, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima 15102, Peru. abraham.vaisberg@upch.pe.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, USA. gb.hammond@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. paula.bates@louisville.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180612,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokinesis/*drug effects', 'Embryophyta/*chemistry', 'Epoxy Compounds/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pyrans/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Plagiochila disticha', 'abscission', 'cytokinesis', 'plagiochiline A']",2018/06/14 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23061418 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23061418 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 Jun 12;23(6). pii: molecules23061418. doi: 10.3390/molecules23061418.,"['0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyrans)', '67779-73-1 (plagiochilin A)']",,PMC6099941,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5784-2346', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0131-1981', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9814-5536']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients had received a median of three prior therapies (range: 0-15); 42% previously received ibrutinib or idelalisib. Median duration of exposure to venetoclax was 16 months (0-56). In the pooled analysis, the most common adverse events (AE) of any grade were diarrhea (41%), neutropenia (40%), nausea (39%), anemia (31%), fatigue (28%), and upper respiratory tract infection (25%). The most common grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (37%), anemia (17%), and thrombocytopenia (14%). With the current 5-week ramp-up dosing, the incidence of laboratory TLS was 1.4% (2/166), none had clinical sequelae, and all of these patients were able to ramp-up to a daily dose of 400 mg. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was manageable with growth factor support and dose adjustments; the incidence of serious infections in these patients was 15%. Ten percent of patients discontinued venetoclax due to AEs and 8% died while on study, with the majority of deaths in the setting of disease progression.Conclusions: Venetoclax as a long-term continuous therapy is generally well tolerated in patients with R/R CLL when initiated with the current treatment algorithm.

It is well known that anticancer agents induce phosphorylation of Mcl-1, which promotes its binding to E3 ubiquitin ligases and subsequent proteasomal degradation and apoptosis. However, other functions of Mcl-1 phosphorylation in cancer cell death have not been well characterized. In this study, we show in colon cancer cells that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) induce GSK3beta-dependent Mcl-1 phosphorylation, but not degradation or downregulation. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of HDACi were dependent on Mcl-1 phosphorylation and were blocked by genetic knock-in of a Mcl-1 phosphorylation site mutant. Phosphorylation-dead Mcl-1 maintained cell survival by binding and sequestering BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins PUMA, Bim, and Noxa, which were upregulated and necessary for apoptosis induction by HDACi. Resistance to HDACi mediated by phosphorylation-dead Mcl-1 was reversed by small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors that liberated BH3-only proteins. These results demonstrate a critical role of Mcl-1 phosphorylation in mediating HDACi sensitivity through a novel and degradation-independent mechanism. These results provide new mechanistic insights on how Mcl-1 maintains cancer cell survival and suggest that Mcl-1-targeting agents are broadly useful for overcoming therapeutic resistance in cancer cells.Significance: These findings present a novel degradation-independent function of Mcl-1 phosphorylation in anticancer therapy that could be useful for developing new Mcl-1-targeting agents to overcome therapeutic resistance.

In adolescents age 15 to 20 years, the use of fully pediatric protocols is supported by many comparative studies of pediatric and adult cooperative groups. In young adults, growing evidence suggests that pediatric-inspired or even fully pediatric approaches may also dramatically improve outcomes, leading to long-term survival rates of almost 70%, despite diminishing indications of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In the last decade, better knowledge of the ALL oncogenic landscape according to age distribution and minimal residual disease assessments has improved risk stratification. New targets have emerged, mostly in the heterogeneous B-other group, particularly in the Philadelphia-like ALL subgroup, which requires both in-depth molecular investigations and specific evaluations of targeted treatments. The remaining gap in the excellent results reported in children has many other contributing factors that should not be underestimated, including late or difficult access to care and/or trials, increased acute toxicities, and poor adherence to treatment. Specific programs should be designed to take into account those factors and finally ameliorate survival and quality of life for AYAs with ALL.","['Boissel, Nicolas', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Boissel N', 'Baruchel A']","['Adolescent and Young Adult Hematology Unit, Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Research Unit EA-3518, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France; and.', 'Research Unit EA-3518, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France; and.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Immunology Department, Robert Debre Hospital (AP-HP), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', '*Decision Making', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/06/14 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32036-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-778530 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jul 26;132(4):351-361. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-778530.

Because of the association between MRD and relapse risk, it has been postulated that testing for MRD posttreatment may help guide postremission treatment strategies by identifying high-risk patients who might benefit from preemptive treatment. This strategy, which remains to be formally tested, may be particularly attractive with availability of agents that could be used to specifically eradicate MRD. This review examines current methods of MRD detection, challenges to adopting MRD testing in routine clinical practice, and recent recommendations for MRD testing in AML issued by the European LeukemiaNet MRD Working Party. Inclusion of MRD as an end point in future randomized clinical trials will provide the data needed to move toward standardizing MRD assays and may provide a more accurate assessment of therapeutic efficacy than current morphologic measures.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Freeman, Sylvie D']","['Ravandi F', 'Walter RB', 'Freeman SD']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2018/06/14 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018016378 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018016378 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 12;2(11):1356-1366. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018016378.,,,PMC5998930,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with blinatumomab demonstrated significant survival benefit over chemotherapy, supporting its use as a bridge therapy to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately, following initial response, approximately 50% of responding patients eventually relapse. At the time of failure, the majority of patients have CD19-positive blasts, yet a concerning number of CD19-negative relapses has been reported. In the data reported herein, we present an interesting case of a 42-year-old patient with primary refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who achieved complete morphologic remission after one cycle of blinatumomab as a single agent. Notably, and in the absence of extramedullary disease history, the response in marrow coincided with the emergence of CD19-positive extramedullary relapse including sites of previous punctures for blood and bone marrow samples, as confirmed by biopsy, as well as parenchymal organs (eg breast and lung). During the second cycle of blinatumomab, a CD19-negative morphological relapse emerged. The loss of CD19 was a transient event, as leukemic cells partially regained it after chemotherapy. This study illustrates a challenging situation of relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia complicated with extramedullary disease after exposure to a bispecific T-cell engager antibody, such as blinatumomab. Physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for the evolution of extramedullary leukemia. This pattern of resistance and/or relapse to blinatumomab resembles the graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogeneic transplantation (stronger in blood and marrow than in other tissues). Mechanisms of resistance to blinatumomab are not yet clear. Combination treatments for refractory patients and those at high risk for exramedullary disease may warrant future assessment.","['Demosthenous, Christos', 'Lalayanni, Chrysavgi', 'Iskas, Michalis', 'Douka, Vassiliki', 'Pastelli, Nikoleta', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles']","['Demosthenous C', 'Lalayanni C', 'Iskas M', 'Douka V', 'Pastelli N', 'Anagnostopoulos A']","['Department of Hematology and HCT Unit, General Hospital of Thessaloniki ""George Papanicolaou"", Thessaloniki, Greece.

Starting from the lead compound LT-106-175, a series of 1-H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide derivatives were synthesized to improve the FLT3 inhibitory potency and selectivity. Among them, compound 50 was identified as a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor (IC50=0.213nM), which showed equal activities against various mutants of FLT3 including FLT3 (ITD)-D835V and FLT3 (ITD)-F691L that is resistant to quizartinib. Compound 50 also exhibited efficacy against the human AML cell line MV4-11 (IC50=16.1nM) harboring FLT3-ITD mutants. Inversely, compound 50 displayed no cytotoxicity to FLT3-independent cells, and the biochemical analyses showed that its effects were related to the inhibition of FLT3 signal pathways. Additionally, compound 50 induced apoptosis in MV4-11cell as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Moreover, compound 50 showed enhanced metabolic stability.

Here, we investigated the role of CARM1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Using conditional knockout mice, we show that loss of CARM1 has little effect on normal hematopoiesis. Strikingly, knockout of Carm1 abrogates both the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by oncogenic transcription factors. We show that CARM1 knockdown impairs cell-cycle progression, promotes myeloid differentiation, and ultimately induces apoptosis. Finally, we utilize a selective, small-molecule inhibitor of CARM1 to validate the efficacy of CARM1 inhibition in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this work suggests that targeting CARM1 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Greenblatt, Sarah M', 'Man, Na', 'Hamard, Pierre-Jacques', 'Asai, Takashi', 'Karl, Daniel', 'Martinez, Concepcion', 'Bilbao, Daniel', 'Stathias, Vasileios', 'Jermakowicz, Anna M', 'Duffort, Stephanie', 'Tadi, Madhavi', 'Blumenthal, Ezra', 'Newman, Samantha', 'Vu, Ly', 'Xu, Ye', 'Liu, Fan', 'Schurer, Stephan C', 'McCabe, Michael T', 'Kruger, Ryan G', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Watts, Justin', 'Vega, Francisco', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Greenblatt SM', 'Man N', 'Hamard PJ', 'Asai T', 'Karl D', 'Martinez C', 'Bilbao D', 'Stathias V', 'Jermakowicz AM', 'Duffort S', 'Tadi M', 'Blumenthal E', 'Newman S', 'Vu L', 'Xu Y', 'Liu F', 'Schurer SC', 'McCabe MT', 'Kruger RG', 'Xu M', 'Yang FC', 'Tenen DG', 'Watts J', 'Vega F', 'Nimer SD']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA; Center for Computational Science, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Discovery Performance Unit, Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, 1250 S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microarray data of GSE51993 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Total 30 chips data from two platforms (each platform including eight CIN III samples data and seven normal cervix samples data) were used to identify the feature miRNAs and genes between CIN III and normal samples, respectively. Then the miRNA- mRNA regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed for all target genes with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tool. Transcription factors (TFs) and cancer-related genes were analyzed. RESULTS: Total 21 putative target miRNAs and 361 putative target mRNAs were gained. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network results showed that miR-338-5p, miR-193a-5p, and miR-216b were top three hub nodes. GO terms significantly enriched were extracellular region (p = 0.004191) and embryonic skeletal system (p = 0.004742). No significantly enriched KEGG pathway term was found in this study.

Previous investigations into the mechanisms underlying pancreatic acinar cell death induced by alcohol metabolites, bile acids, or asparaginase indicated that loss of intracellular ATP generation is an important factor. We now report that, in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells or cell clusters, removal of extracellular glucose had little effect on this ATP loss, suggesting that glucose metabolism was severely inhibited under these conditions. Surprisingly, we show that replacing glucose with galactose prevented or markedly reduced the loss of ATP and any subsequent necrosis. Addition of pyruvate had a similar protective effect. We also studied the effect of galactose in vivo in mouse models of AP induced either by a combination of fatty acids and ethanol or asparaginase. In both cases, galactose markedly reduced acinar necrosis and inflammation. Based on these data, we suggest that galactose feeding may be used to protect against AP.","['Peng, Shuang', 'Gerasimenko, Julia V', 'Tsugorka, Tetyana M', 'Gryshchenko, Oleksiy', 'Samarasinghe, Sujith', 'Petersen, Ole H', 'Gerasimenko, Oleg V']","['Peng S', 'Gerasimenko JV', 'Tsugorka TM', 'Gryshchenko O', 'Samarasinghe S', 'Petersen OH', 'Gerasimenko OV']","['Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology, Kiev, Ukraine.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180730,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Acinar Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ethanol/toxicity', 'Galactose/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hexokinase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Necrosis', 'Pancreas/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Pancreatitis/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pyruvic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Calcium signaling', '*Gastroenterology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",2018/06/13 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['94714 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI94714 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Aug 31;128(9):3769-3778. doi: 10.1172/JCI94714.

The clinical course of patients with CLL is heterogeneous, ranging from indolent to aggressive. The role of lymphocyte activation in the natural history of CLL is still a matter of discussion. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the percentages and absolute numbers of lymphocytes B and T in peripheral blood and bone marrow of CLL patients. Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between the number of CD25-positive and CD69-positive lymphocytes and the established prognostic factors in CLL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 80 untreated patients with CLL and 20 healthy subjects. The immunophenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (in both groups) and bone marrow cells (solely in the CLL group) was determined by means of flow cytometry. RESULTS: Patients with CLL showed a higher absolute number of activated lymphocytes B with phenotypes CD19+CD25+ and CD19+CD69+, as well as a higher absolute number of CD3+CD25+ lymphocytes T than the controls. The enhanced activation of peripheral blood and bone marrow lymphocytes was associated with higher Rai stages, an increased concentration of lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin and the progression of the disease. The number of lymphocytes B CD19+ZAP-70+ correlated positively with the number of CD19+CD25+ B cells and CD3+CD69+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the association between an unfavorable prognosis and a high expression of activation markers in CLL patients. The determination of CD25+ and CD69+ lymphocytes T and B constitutes a valuable diagnostic tool, completing the cytometric evaluation of CLL.","['Grywalska, Ewelina', 'Bartkowiak-Emeryk, Malgorzata', 'Pasiarski, Marcin', 'Olszewska-Bozek, Karolina', 'Mielnik, Michal', 'Podgajna, Martyna', 'Pieczykolan, Monika', 'Hymos, Anna', 'Fitas, Elzbieta', 'Surdacka, Agata', 'Gozdz, Stanislaw', 'Rolinski, Jacek']","['Grywalska E', 'Bartkowiak-Emeryk M', 'Pasiarski M', 'Olszewska-Bozek K', 'Mielnik M', 'Podgajna M', 'Pieczykolan M', 'Hymos A', 'Fitas E', 'Surdacka A', 'Gozdz S', 'Rolinski J']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Otolaryngology and Laryngeal Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Lectins, C-Type/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'lymphocyte count', 'prognostic marker']",2018/06/13 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/74437 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2018 Jul;27(7):987-999. doi: 10.17219/acem/74437.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric secondary HLH is usually triggered by infection, malignancy, or rheumatological disorders. The diagnosis of malignancy-associated HLH (MA-HLH) poses a difficult challenge as clinical features may be attributed to the underlying disease or chemotherapy. Our study aimed to see the occurrence of this rare entity at our centre. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from all pediatric oncology patient treated at our center with the diagnosis of MA-HLH from January 2012 to December 2014. Data were collected for age, sex, underlying disease, treatment protocol, stage of chemotherapy, any underlying infection, treatment given for HLH, and outcome. Results: There were five patients with a diagnosis of MA-HLH in the study period. Age ranged from 18 months to 9 years. Of the five MA-HLH, two patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, two acute myeloid leukemia, and one had Hodgkin lymphoma. The three patients who had documented microbiological infection also did not improve after appropriate treatment. Two patients died during treatment. One patient improved completely on steroid alone. One patient received HLH 2004 induction. Conclusion: The delay in the diagnosis of MA-HLH in pediatric patients may be due to decrease awareness about the condition the timely diagnosis of MA-HLH is crucial for a better outcome.

We retrospectively analyzed adult patients with newly diagnosed APL from 2004 through 2014 to identify incident AEs following treatment and contributing risk factors. Cardiac and neurologic AEs were more common and characterized in detail. Cardiac AEs such as the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias, and heart failure had a cumulative incidence of 6.4% (CI95 1.8-11.1%), 2.9% (CI95 0.0-6.4%), 5.8% (CI95 1.2-10.3%) at 4 years from diagnosis, respectively. In multivariate analyses of factors influencing heart failure, the presence of clinical or radiographic CAD (HR 4.25; P=0.011) or troponin elevation prior to completion of therapy (HR 8.86; P=0.0018) were associated with increased heart failure incidence, but not anthracycline use or dose. Neurological AEs were common following therapy; at 4 years, the cumulative incidence of vision changes was 12.4% (CI95 6.0-18.7%), peripheral neuropathy 10.3% (CI95 4.5-16.1%), and memory or cognitive change 7.6% (CI95 2.5-12.7%). We did not identify any association between specific therapies and the development of cardiac and neurologic AEs. APL is a highly curable leukemia; further efforts are needed to address incident chronic AEs, with particular focus on cardiac and neurological care.","['Kim, Peter Geon', 'Bridgham, Kelly', 'Chen, Evan C', 'Vidula, Mahesh K', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Fathi, Amir T']","['Kim PG', 'Bridgham K', 'Chen EC', 'Vidula MK', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Brunner AM', 'Fathi AT']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180505,Netherlands,Leuk Res Rep,Leukemia research reports,101608906,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiac', 'Leukemia', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome assessment', 'Promyelocytic']",2018/06/13 06:00,2018/06/13 06:01,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.lrr.2018.05.001 [doi]', 'S2213-0489(18)30012-8 [pii]']",epublish,Leuk Res Rep. 2018 May 5;9:79-83. doi: 10.1016/j.lrr.2018.05.001. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5993355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given antileukemic drug-induced oxidative stress and toxicity, this study focused on the mitigatory role of eugenol, a monoterpene compound from clove oil, in the hepatic tissue of Wistar rats. Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar rats (180-250 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups (6 rats per group): normal control rats, rats treated with As2O2 (4 mg/kg bwt), rats treated with eugenol (5 mg/kg bwt), and rats receiving co-treatment with As2O3 (4 mg/kg bwt) and eugenol (5 mg/kg bwt), all of which orally administered for a period of 30 days. The Tukey test (Origin version 7, Origin Lab Corporation, Northampton, USA) was applied to analyze the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the different groups. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Result: Oral administration of As2O3 significantly induced hepatic damage, evident from increased levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). Moreover, a decrease in the activities of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants altered electrolyte concentration and increased the rate of lipid peroxidation (P=0.04) and the level of nitric oxide (P=0.01). Accumulation studies and histopathological analyses confirmed the biochemical variations. Co-treatment with eugenol (5 mg/kg bwt) exhibited hepatoprotective effects as manifested by the decreased rate of arsenic accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide level along with normalized levels of antioxidants and maintained histology of the liver. Conclusion: Eugenol may be used in combination with arsenic trioxide in chemotherapy to reduce oxidative damage to the hepatic system.","['Binu, Prakash PhD', 'Priya, Nellikunnath MPHIL', 'Abhilash, Surendran PhD', 'Vineetha, Radhakrishnan Chandraprabha PhD', 'Nair, Harikumaran PhD']","['Binu P PhD', 'Priya N MPHIL', 'Abhilash S PhD', 'Vineetha RC PhD', 'Nair H PhD']","['School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidants', 'Eugenol', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Oxidative stress', 'Arsenic trioxide']",2018/06/13 06:00,2018/06/13 06:01,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2018 May;43(3):305-312.,,,PMC5993899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive efforts have focused on therapeutic targeting of glycolysis, whereas drugging mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has remained largely unexplored, partly owing to an incomplete understanding of tumor contexts in which OXPHOS is essential. Here, we report the discovery of IACS-010759, a clinical-grade small-molecule inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Treatment with IACS-010759 robustly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in models of brain cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reliant on OXPHOS, likely owing to a combination of energy depletion and reduced aspartate production that leads to impaired nucleotide biosynthesis. In models of brain cancer and AML, tumor growth was potently inhibited in vivo following IACS-010759 treatment at well-tolerated doses. IACS-010759 is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials in relapsed/refractory AML and solid tumors.","['Molina, Jennifer R', 'Sun, Yuting', 'Protopopova, Marina', 'Gera, Sonal', 'Bandi,

However, combined deficiency in these three processes does not result in spontaneous tumor formation as observed upon loss of p53, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that are critical mediators of p53-dependent tumor suppression function(3-5). To define such mechanisms, we performed in vivo shRNA screens targeting p53-regulated genes in sensitized genetic backgrounds. We found that knockdown of Zmat3, Ctsf and Cav1, promoted lymphoma/leukemia development only when PUMA and p21, the critical effectors of p53-driven apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence, were also absent. Notably, loss of the DNA repair gene Mlh1 caused lymphoma in a wild-type background, and its enforced expression was able to delay tumor development driven by loss of p53. Further examination of direct p53 target genes implicated in DNA repair showed that knockdown of Mlh1, Msh2, Rnf144b, Cav1 and Ddit4 accelerated MYC-driven lymphoma development to a similar extent as knockdown of p53. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that extensive functional overlap of several p53-regulated processes safeguards against cancer and that coordination of DNA repair appears to be an important process by which p53 suppresses tumor development.","['Janic, Ana', 'Valente, Liz J', 'Wakefield, Matthew J', 'Di Stefano, Leon', 'Milla, Liz', 'Wilcox, Stephen', 'Yang, Haoyu', 'Tai, Lin',

Aptamers that internalize into target cells can deliver siRNAs (<15 kDa, 19-21 nt/strand). We demonstrate a modular nanostructure for cellular delivery of large, functional RNA payloads (50-80 kDa, 175-250 nt) by aptamers that recognize multiple human B cell cancer lines and transferrin receptor-expressing cells. Fluorogenic RNA reporter payloads enable accelerated testing of platform designs and rapid evaluation of assembly and internalization. Modularity is demonstrated by swapping in different targeting and payload aptamers. Both modules internalize into leukemic B cell lines and remained colocalized within endosomes. Fluorescence from internalized RNA persists for >/=2 h, suggesting a sizable window for aptamer payloads to exert influence upon targeted cells. This demonstration of aptamer-mediated, cell-internalizing delivery of large RNAs with retention of functional structure raises the possibility of manipulating endosomes and cells by delivering large aptamers and regulatory RNAs.","['Porciani, David', 'Cardwell, Leah N', 'Tawiah, Kwaku D', 'Alam, Khalid K', 'Lange, Margaret J', 'Daniels, Mark A', 'Burke, Donald H']","['Porciani D', 'Cardwell LN', 'Tawiah KD', 'Alam KK', 'Lange MJ', 'Daniels MA', 'Burke DH']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65212, USA. porcianid@missouri.edu.', 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA. porcianid@missouri.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA. porcianid@missouri.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65212, USA.', 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA.', 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA.', 'Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65212, USA.', 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65212, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65212, USA. burkedh@missouri.edu.', 'Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA. burkedh@missouri.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA. burkedh@missouri.edu.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, USA. burkedh@missouri.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180611,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,"['Animals', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*administration & dosage/chemistry/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dogs', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Endocytosis', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nanostructures/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation']",,,2018/06/13 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-04691-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-04691-x [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jun 11;9(1):2283. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04691-x.,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)']",,PMC5995956,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7803-6546', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6513-8391']",,"['R01 AI074389/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI121938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI074389/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National Institutes', 'of Health (NIH)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these are commonly either a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in general, they are a heterogeneous group of diseases, and a unified mechanism for their development has remained elusive. Here we report next-generation sequencing, including whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and targeted sequencing, of a case of donor-derived MDS (dMDS) following HCT for high-risk B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in an adolescent. Through interrogation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the WGS data, we unequivocally prove that the MDS is donor-derived. Additionally, we sequenced 15 samples from 12 time points, including the initial B-ALL diagnostic sample through several post-HCT remission samples, the dMDS, and representative germline samples from both patient and donor, to show that the MDS-related pathologic mutations, including a canonical ASXL1 (p.Y700*) mutation, were detectable nearly 3 yr prior to the morphological detection of MDS. Furthermore, these MDS mutations were not detectable immediately following, and for >1 yr post-, HCT. These data support the clinical utility of comprehensive sequencing following HCT to detect donor-derived malignancies, while providing insights into the clonal progression of dMDS over a 4-yr period.","['Schwartz, Jason R', 'Walsh, Michael P', 'Ma, Jing', 'Lamprecht, Tamara', 'Wang, Shuoguo', 'Wu, Gang', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Triplett, Brandon M', 'Klco, Jeffery M']","['Schwartz JR', 'Walsh MP', 'Ma J', 'Lamprecht T', 'Wang S', 'Wu G', 'Raimondi S', 'Triplett BM', 'Klco JM']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplant & Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181001,United States,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies,101660017,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/therapy', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*leukemia', '*multiple lineage myelodysplasia']",2018/06/13 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['mcs.a002980 [pii]', '10.1101/mcs.a002980 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud. 2018 Oct 1;4(5). pii: mcs.a002980. doi: 10.1101/mcs.a002980.

METHODS: We examined the expression levels of miR-218 in 68 pairs of OS and adjacent tissue samples using qRT-PCR. Cultured human OS cell line Saos-2 was transfected with miR-218 mimics or anti-miR-218 mimics, and the cell apoptosis was assessed using CCK-8 assay, annexin V-FITC staining and Western blotting. We also analyzed the potential functional targets of miR-218 in Saos-2 cells using luciferase assay, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-218 was lowered by at least 8 folds in OS tissues as compared with the adjacent tissues. In cultured Saos-2 cells, transfection with miR-218 mimics for 24, 36, and 48 h resulted in a significant reduction in the cell viability, while transfection with anti-miR-218 mimics significantly increased the cell viability. The cells transfected with miR-218 mimics showed an obviously enhanced expression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (C-PARP) as compared with the cells transfected with anti-miR-218 mimics and the control cells. Flow cytometry demonstrated obviously increased apoptosis of the cells following miR-218 mimics transfection. We identified the oncogene B lymphoma mouse Moloney leukemia virus insertion region 1 (BMI-1) as a specific target of miR-218 in Saos-2 cells. BMI-1 expressions at both the mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in Saos-2 cells overexpressing miR-218 but increased in the cells with miR-218 knockdown as compared to the control cells. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-218 directly inhibited the expression of BMI-1 via binding to its 3'-UTR in OS cells. CONCLUSION: miR-218 can promote OS cell apoptosis and plays the role as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating BMI-1.","['Lai, Gui-Hua', 'Huang, Ai-Lan', 'Zhao, Zhi', 'Lu, Xing-Hao', 'Zu, Wen-Xuan']","['Lai GH', 'Huang AL', 'Zhao Z', 'Lu XH', 'Zu WX']","['Department of Human Anatomy, First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, China.E-mail: lailgh198272@ foxmail.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2018/06/13 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2018 May 20;38(5):505-510.,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MIRN218 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,PMC6743892,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence is 4400 new cases per year in France. The prevalence increases with age with a median age at diagnostic of 65 years. Renal involvement is rare and estimated at 1.2% of patients with CLL. Renal pathological diagnoses associated with CLL are variable and are not always related to the hematological disease. We report here on cases of patients with CLL who underwent a renal biopsy over the past 16 years in Marseille. METHODS: All cases of renal biopsies performed in patients with CLL between2000 and 2016 in Marseille were included. Pathological analysis was performed by the same experimented pathologist. Data were collected at the time of biopsy and after treatment. RESULTS: Ten patients were included in this study. The reason for renal biopsy was acute kidney injury or the onset of nephrotic syndrome. We report on 4 cases of membranous nephropathy, 1 minimal change disease, 1 cryglobulinemia-related membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, 1 light chain amyloidosis, 1 fibrillary glomerulonephritis, 1 interstitial monoclonal infiltration and one case of non-specific tubular lesions. Only one patient was treated before the biopsy, 7 patients received a specific hematological treatment of CLL because of its renal involvement. Renal and hematological responses were variable. CONCLUSION: Renal involvement of CLL is rare and is not mentioned in the Binet classification. Yet, it can be severe, with acute kidney injury or nephrotic syndrome, and can lead to the initiation of a specific treatment. The most frequent presentation this series was secondary MN, which differs from previous series.","['Vial, R', 'Daniel, L', 'Devos, M', 'Bouchacourt, B', 'Cazajous, G', 'Sichez, H', 'Mazodier, K', 'Lankester, M', 'Gobert, P', 'Seguier, J', 'Swiader, L', 'Sallee, M', 'Jourde-Chiche, N', 'Harle, J-R']","['Vial R', 'Daniel L', 'Devos M', 'Bouchacourt B', 'Cazajous G', 'Sichez H', 'Mazodier K', 'Lankester M', 'Gobert P', 'Seguier J', 'Swiader L', 'Sallee M', 'Jourde-Chiche N', 'Harle JR']","['Medecine interne, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 264, rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France; Centre de nephrologie et de transplantation renale, hopital de la Conception (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', ""Laboratoire d'anatomo-pathologie, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France."", 'Medecine interne, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 264, rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', 'Medecine interne, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 264, rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', ""Service de nephrologie, hopital d'instructions des armees Saint-Anne, 83000 Toulon, France."", 'Service de nephrologie, hopital europeen, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', 'Medecine interne, hopital de la Conception (AP-HM), 13385 Marseille cedex 05France.', 'Service de nephrologie, residence du Parc, 13009 Marseille, France.', 'Service de nephrologie, hopital Henri-Duffaut, 84000 Avignon, France.', 'Medecine interne, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 264, rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', 'Medecine interne, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 264, rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', 'Centre de nephrologie et de transplantation renale, hopital de la Conception (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', 'Centre de nephrologie et de transplantation renale, hopital de la Conception (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.', 'Medecine interne, hopital de la Timone (AP-HM), Aix-Marseille universite, 264, rue Saint-Pierre, 13385 Marseille cedex 05, France.

The drug is generally well tolerated; however, not infrequent side effects are reported, with the major two being bleeding and ibrutinib-related atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation pathogenesis in this setting is not completely clear, and no prospective studies have evaluated the impact of previous cardiologic history and baseline characteristics. METHODS: We prospectively performed cardiologic assessment in 43 CLL patients before starting ibrutinib therapy. Cardiologic workup included comorbidity collection and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic baseline evaluation. RESULTS: After a median observation of 8 months, seven patients developed atrial fibrillation (16.3%). Cases developing atrial fibrillation were all elderly males (p = 0.04), and mostly with a history of previous arterial hypertension (p = 0.009). Atrial fibrillation occurrence also correlated with the presence of one or more pre-existent cardiologic comorbidities (p = 0.03), with a higher atrial fibrillation risk score (calculated with comorbidities and cardiologic risk factor evaluation p < 0.001), and with higher left atrial diameter (p = 0.02) and area (p = 0.03) by echocardiography. The occurrence of atrial fibrillation was managed after an integrated cardio-oncologic evaluation: anticoagulation was started in 4 (57.1%) patients and beta-blockers or amiodarone in 5 (71.4%). One patient underwent electric cardioversion and another patient pacemaker positioning to normalise heart rate in order to continue ibrutinib. CONCLUSION: Our data show that echocardiography is a highly informative and reproducible tool that should be included in pre-treatment workup for patients who are candidates for ibrutinib therapy.","['Reda, Gianluigi', 'Fattizzo, Bruno', 'Cassin, Ramona', 'Mattiello, Veronica', 'Tonella, Tatiana', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Massari, Ferdinando', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Reda G', 'Fattizzo B', 'Cassin R', 'Mattiello V', 'Tonella T', 'Giannarelli D', 'Massari F', 'Cortelezzi A']","[""UOC Ematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy. gianluigi.reda@policlinico.mi.it."", ""UOC Ematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, Universita degli Studi di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy."", ""UOC Ematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy."", ""UOC Ematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, Universita degli Studi di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy."", ""UOC Malattie Cardiovascolari, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, Universita degli Studi di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy."", 'Bio-statistical Unit, Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, via Elio Chianesi 53, 00144, Roma, Italy.', ""UOC Malattie Cardiovascolari, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, Universita degli Studi di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy."", ""UOC Ematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano, Universita degli Studi di Milano, via Francesco Sforza 35, 20135, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Letter'],20180611,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Atrial Fibrillation/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Echocardiography/methods', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Reproducibility of Results']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Atrial fibrillation', '*Cardio-oncology', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*Ibrutinib']",2018/06/13 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0626-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0626-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Jun 11;11(1):79. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0626-0.,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,PMC5996546,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4687-7089'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the BCR-ABL domain increase formation of IM resistance in CML. However, not all patients are BCR-ABL domain-mutant dependent. Investigating non-mutant mechanisms in the development of acquired IM resistance is a critical issue. We explored the mechanisms which influence IM efficacy and resistance in CML. Higher protective autophagy was identified in IM-resistant K562 (K562R) cells. Inhibition of autophagy by the inhibitors, chloroquine and 3-methyladenine, enhanced IM's efficacy in K562R cells. In addition, microRNA (miR)-199a/b-5p were downregulated in K562R cells compared to parent cells. Overexpression of miR-199a/b-5p reduced autophagy and induced cell apoptosis, resulting in enhanced IM's efficacy in K562R cells. Moreover, expression levels of the Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 2 (WNT2), a positive regulator of autophagy, were significantly higher in K562R cells, and it was validated as a direct target gene of miR-199a/b-5p. Overexpressions of miR-199a/b-5p inhibited WNT2 downstream signaling. Furthermore, overexpression and knockdown of WNT2 influenced autophagy formation and CML drug sensitivity to IM. Overexpression of WNT2 could also reverse miR-199a/b-5p-enhanced IM efficacy in K562R cells. These results emphasized that miR-199a/b-5p inhibited autophagy via repressing WNT2 signaling and might provide novel therapeutic strategies for future IM-resistant CML therapy and drug development.","['Chen, Peng-Hsu', 'Liu, Ann-Jeng', 'Ho, Kuo-Hao', 'Chiu, Ya-Ting', 'Anne Lin, Zhe-Harn', 'Lee, Yi-Ting', 'Shih, Chwen-Ming', 'Chen, Ku-Chung']","['Chen PH', 'Liu AJ', 'Ho KH', 'Chiu YT', 'Anne Lin ZH', 'Lee YT', 'Shih CM', 'Chen KC']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Taipei City Hospital Ren-Ai Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.

The aim of the study was to compare constitutive PI3K-Akt-mTOR activation of primary AML cells for a large group of unselected patients. METHODS: We investigated expression and phosphorylation of 18 mediators in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR main track by flow cytometry for AML cells derived from 77 patients, and compared this with global gene expression profiles, proteomic, and transcriptomic profiles, and susceptibility to antileukemic agents. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two main subsets showing generally high or low constitutive pathway activation. The high activation subset was characterized by decreased frequency of cells showing monocytic differentiation, increased frequency of adverse karyotypes, decreased constitutive cytokine release, and increased expression of certain integrins. Finally, the two groups differed in their expression of genes encoding regulators of protein phosphorylation, whereas phosphoproteomic analyses showed differences especially with regard to transcriptional regulation. Antiproliferative effects of pathway inhibition were generally stronger for the low phosphorylation subset. CONCLUSION: The constitutive PI3K-Akt-mTOR activation differed between patients; this difference appears to be a part of complex phenotypic differences including cell communication, intracellular signaling through other pathways, and transcriptional regulation.","['Nepstad, Ina', 'Hatfield, Kimberley J', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Bartaula-Brevik, Sushma', 'Berven, Frode', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Skavland, Jorn', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Nepstad I', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Aasebo E', 'Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Brenner AK', 'Bartaula-Brevik S', 'Berven F', 'Selheim F', 'Skavland J', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'b Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'c Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'c Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'c Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'c Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry , University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'd Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science , University of Bergen , Norway.', 'd Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180622,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Akt', '*PI3K', '*cell signaling', '*mTOR', '*phosphorylation']",2018/06/12 06:00,2019/02/08 06:00,['2018/06/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2018.1487401 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2018 Jul;22(7):639-653. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2018.1487401.

IKZF1 is implicated in lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation and negative regulation of cell proliferation. In humans, somatic mutations in IKZF1 have been linked to the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adults. Recently, heterozygous germline IKZF1 mutations have been identified in patients with a B cell immune deficiency mimicking common variable immunodeficiency. These mutations demonstrated incomplete penetrance and led to haploinsufficiency. Herein, we report 7 unrelated patients with a novel early-onset combined immunodeficiency associated with de novo germline IKZF1 heterozygous mutations affecting amino acid N159 located in the DNA-binding domain of IKZF1. Different bacterial and viral infections were diagnosed, but Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was reported in all patients. One patient developed a T cell ALL. This immunodeficiency was characterized by innate and adaptive immune defects, including low numbers of B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and myeloid dendritic cells, as well as T cell and monocyte dysfunctions. Notably, most T cells exhibited a naive phenotype and were unable to evolve into effector memory cells. Functional studies indicated these mutations act as dominant negative. This defect expands the clinical spectrum of human IKZF1-associated diseases from somatic to germline, from haploinsufficient to dominant negative.","['Boutboul, David', 'Kuehn, Hye Sun', 'Van de Wyngaert, Zoe', 'Niemela, Julie E', 'Callebaut, Isabelle', 'Stoddard, Jennifer', 'Lenoir, Christelle', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Farnarier, Catherine', 'Vely, Frederic', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Hoshino, Akihiro', 'Hauck, Fabian', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Roehrs, Philip', 'Chen, Shaoying', 'Verbsky, James W', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Husami, Ammar', 'Zhang, Kejian', 'Roberts, Joseph', 'Amrol, David', 'Sleaseman, John', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Marsh, Rebecca', 'Fischer, Alain', 'Fleisher, Thomas A', 'Picard, Capucine', 'Latour, Sylvain', 'Rosenzweig, Sergio D']","['Boutboul D', 'Kuehn HS', 'Van de Wyngaert Z', 'Niemela JE', 'Callebaut I', 'Stoddard J', 'Lenoir C', 'Barlogis V', 'Farnarier C', 'Vely F', 'Yoshida N', 'Kojima S', 'Kanegane H', 'Hoshino A', 'Hauck F', 'Lhermitte L', 'Asnafi V', 'Roehrs P', 'Chen S', 'Verbsky JW', 'Calvo KR', 'Husami A', 'Zhang K', 'Roberts J', 'Amrol D', 'Sleaseman J', 'Hsu AP', 'Holland SM', 'Marsh R', 'Fischer A', 'Fleisher TA', 'Picard C', 'Latour S', 'Rosenzweig SD']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and Susceptibility to EBV Infection, Inserm UMR 1163, Paris, France.', 'Immunology Service, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and Susceptibility to EBV Infection, Inserm UMR 1163, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.', 'Immunology Service, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 7590, Sorbonne Universities, University Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6-MNHN-IRD-IUC, Paris, France.', 'Immunology Service, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and Susceptibility to EBV Infection, Inserm UMR 1163, Paris, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, La Timone Hospital, Marseille, France.', ""Assistance Publique -

In the cell nucleus, PML seeds the formation of macromolecular multiprotein complexes, known as PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). While PML NBs have been implicated in many cellular functions including cell cycle regulation, survival and apoptosis their role as signaling hubs along major genome maintenance pathways emerged more clearly. However, despite extensive research over the past decades, the precise biochemical function of PML in these pathways is still elusive. It remains a big challenge to unify all the different previously suggested cellular functions of PML NBs into one mechanistic model. With the advent of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins it became possible to trace protein function in living specimens. In parallel, a variety of fluorescence fluctuation microscopy (FFM) approaches have been developed which allow precise determination of the biophysical and interaction properties of cellular factors at the single molecule level in living cells. In this report, we summarize the current knowledge on PML nuclear bodies and describe several fluorescence imaging, manipulation, FFM, and super-resolution techniques suitable to analyze PML body assembly and function. These include fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, raster image correlation spectroscopy, ultraviolet laser microbeam-induced DNA damage, erythrocyte-mediated force application, and super-resolution microscopy approaches. Since most if not all of the microscopic equipment to perform these techniques may be available in an institutional or nearby facility, we hope to encourage more researches to exploit sophisticated imaging tools for their research in cancer biology.","['Hoischen, Christian', 'Monajembashi, Shamci', 'Weisshart, Klaus', 'Hemmerich, Peter']","['Hoischen C', 'Monajembashi S', 'Weisshart K', 'Hemmerich P']","['Leibniz Institute on Aging Research, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging Research, Jena, Germany.', 'Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging Research, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180525,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,['NOTNLM'],"['fluorescence fluctuation microscopy', 'live cell imaging', 'oncogene', 'promyelocytic leukemia', 'super-resolution', 'tumor suppressor']",2018/06/12 06:00,2018/06/12 06:01,['2018/06/12 06:00'],"['2017/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00125 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 May 25;8:125. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00125. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5980967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in 5 hospitals in the province of Punjab, Pakistan, from May to September 2014, and comprised adult leukaemia patients and healthy controls with similar gender and marital status, and children patients and healthy controls with matching age and gender. Interviews were carried out face-to-face with adults and with the parents of the minors to obtain information on family history, lifestyle risk factors, employment history, residential history, trauma history and occupational and non-occupational exposures by using a close-ended questionnaire. Data was analysed using SPSS 16. RESULTS: Of the 75 adults, 25(33.3%) were patients and 50(66.6%) were controls,while of the 120 children, 40(33.3%) were patients and 80(66.6%) were controls. Among adults those at risk of leukaemia had exposure to chemical factory (p <0.05),positive family history of leukaemia (p <0.006), positive trauma history (p <0.004), those who dyed hair (p<0.003), smokers (p <0.054) were born 1st or 4th among their siblings (p <0.037), lived near crops (p <0.069), worked in oil-refining factory (p <0.12), or spent more than 7 hours under direct sunlight (p <0.002).

AIM: To systematically determine the incidence rates of gastro-intestinal cancers other than gastric cancers (GI-other-than-GC) and non-gastrointestinal cancers (non-GIC) in PA adults, globally and per tumour site, and the risk associated with PA for GI-other than GC and non-GIC. METHODS: Studies of PA patients reporting the incidence of GI-other-than-GCs and non-GICs were identified with MEDLINE (PubMed)-EMBASE (from first date available to April 2017). A meta-analysis of annual cancer incidence rates was performed. The outcome was the cumulative incidence of GI-other-than-GCs and non-GICs (ratio between the numbers of new cancer cases identified during the follow-up period and the number of PA patients) and the incidence rate expressed as the rate of events-per-time-unit (person-years). RESULTS: Of 82,257 PA patients, the pooled incidence rates/100 person-years for non-GCs and non-GICs of 0.27 (95% CI:0.16-0.42) and 0.23 (95% CI:0.22-0.25) were calculated by meta-analysis. Compared to the GLOBOCAN data for the general population from the countries of the included studies, the meta-analysis showed an overall relative risk (RR) of cancer in PA of 0.68 (95% CI:0.48-0.95). PA patients had a lower RR of colorectal, breast, liver, oesophageal, lung, thyroid, ovary, non-melanoma skin and kidney cancers but had a higher RR of biliary tract cancer (1.81:1.21-2.70), multiple myeloma (2.83:1.76-4.55), Hodgkin's lymphoma (3.0:1.35-6.68), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.08: 1.58-2.75), and leukaemia (1.56:1.16-2.12). CONCLUSION: An overall lower RR of cancers-other-than-gastric-cancer in PA patients but an increased RR of biliary tract cancers and haematological malignancies was observed.","['Lahner, Edith', 'Capasso, Marina', 'Carabotti, Marilia', 'Annibale, Bruno']","['Lahner E', 'Capasso M', 'Carabotti M', 'Annibale B']","['Medical-Surgical Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.

In contrast, HO-1 (heat shock protein 32) plays a key role in protecting tumor cells from apoptosis. METHODS: HDAC4/5, HO-1 and Smad7 expressions in 34 newly diagnosed B-ALL cases were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot. Lentivirus and small interference RNA were used to transfect B-ALL cells. The expression of Smad7 was detected after treatment with LMK-235 or Hemin and ZnPP. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by flow cytometry, CCK-8 assay and Western blot. RESULTS: HDAC4/5 was overexpressed in B-ALL patients with high HO-1 levels. Increasing the concentration of HDAC4/5 inhibitor LMK-235 induced the decrease of Smad7 and HO-1 expressions and the apoptosis of B-ALL cells by suppressing the phosphorylation of AKT (Protein kinase B). Up-regulating HO-1 alleviated the decrease of Smad7 expression and enhanced B-ALL resistance to LMK-235 by activating p-AKT which reduced the apoptosis of B-ALL cells and influenced the survival of leukemia patients. Silencing Smad7 also augmented the apoptosis rate of B-ALL cells by suppressing p-AKT. CONCLUSION: HO-1 played a key role in protecting tumor cells from apoptosis, and HDAC4/5 were related with the apoptosis of B-ALL cells. LMK-235 may be able to improve the poor survival of leukemia patients.","['Guo, Yongling', 'Fang, Qin', 'Ma, Dan', 'Yu, Kunling', 'Cheng, Bingqing', 'Tang, Sishi', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Wang, Weili', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Guo Y', 'Fang Q', 'Ma D', 'Yu K', 'Cheng B', 'Tang S', 'Lu T', 'Wang W', 'Wang J']","['School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China; Department of Hematology, Guihang Guiyang Hospital, Guiyang, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.

CASE: A previously healthy 18-month-old female toddler presented with 6 days of fevers, vulvar rash, and ulcers. Vulvar cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus and P aeruginosa. Bloodwork showed pancytopenia and P aeruginosa bacteremia. She started receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Bone marrow aspirate revealed a hypocellular marrow with erythroid dysplasia. Vulvar ulcers progressed rapidly, therefore magnetic resonance imaging was performed to rule out necrotizing fasciitis. She was diagnosed with ecthyma gangrenosum (EG). Three months after initial presentation, she was diagnosed with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: This case highlights that health care providers should suspect EG when severe vulvar ulcers are present with P aeruginosa infection and neutropenia. Because EG poses significant morbidity and mortality, its presence should prompt aggressive antimicrobial therapy and mobilization of a multidisciplinary team to initiate workup for an underlying immunodeficiency syndrome or malignancy. This case also illustrates that surgical debridement might be avoided in certain patients with EG as long as meticulous wound care and close monitoring with a multidisciplinary team are in place.","['Todd, Nicole', 'Boucher, Julia E', 'Bassal, Mylene', 'Dumont, Tania', 'Fleming, Nathalie']","['Todd N', 'Boucher JE', 'Bassal M', 'Dumont T', 'Fleming N']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Division of Gynecology, Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Division of Gynecology, Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Despite their potential as novel targets for therapeutic intervention, mechanisms of NR4A silencing and strategies for their reactivation remain poorly defined. Here we show that NR4A silencing in AML occurs through blockade of transcriptional elongation rather than epigenetic promoter silencing. By intersection of NR4A-regulated gene signatures captured upon acute, exogenous expression of NR4As in human AML cells with in silico chemical genomics screening, we identify several FDA-approved drugs including dihydroergotamine (DHE) that reactivate NR4A expression and regulate NR4A-dependent gene signatures. We show that DHE induces NR4A expression via recruitment of the super elongation complex to enable elongation of NR4A promoter paused RNA polymerase II. Finally, DHE exhibits AML selective NR4A-dependent anti-leukemic activity in cytogenetically distinct human AML cells in vitro and delays AML progression in mice revealing its potential as a novel therapeutic agent in AML.","['Boudreaux, Seth P', 'Duren, Ryan P', 'Call, Steven G', 'Nguyen, Loc', 'Freire, Pablo R', 'Narayanan, Padmini', 'Redell, Michele S', 'Conneely, Orla M']","['Boudreaux SP', 'Duren RP', 'Call SG', 'Nguyen L', 'Freire PR', 'Narayanan P', 'Redell MS', 'Conneely OM']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'New Iberia Research Center, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, New Iberia, LA, 70560, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. orlac@bcm.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dihydroergotamine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/06/10 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2018/06/10 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0174-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0174-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jan;33(1):52-63. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0174-1.

Outcomes for many children with JMML remain dismal with current standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We used patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to characterize the signaling profiles and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of PTPN11-mutant and CBL-mutant JMML. We assessed whether MEK, JAK, and PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors (i) could inhibit myeloproliferation and aberrant signaling in iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors with PTPN11 E76K or CBL Y371H mutations. We detected constitutive Ras/MAPK and PI3K/mTOR signaling in PTPN11 and CBL iPSC-derived myeloid cells. Activated signaling and growth of PTPN11 iPSCs were preferentially inhibited in vitro by the MEKi PD0325901 and trametinib. Conversely, JAK/STAT signaling was selectively activated in CBL iPSCs and abrogated by the JAKi momelotinib and ruxolitinib. The PI3Kdeltai idelalisib and mTORi rapamycin inhibited signaling and myeloproliferation in both PTPN11 and CBL iPSCs. These findings demonstrate differential sensitivity of PTPN11 iPSCs to MEKi and of CBL iPSCs to JAKi, but similar sensitivity to PI3Ki and mTORi.

One such potential therapeutic strategy is to target the ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 (UBA1), the initiating enzyme in the ubiquitylation cascade in which proteins are tagged with ubiquitin moieties to regulate their degradation or function. Here, we evaluated TAK-243, a first-in-class UBA1 inhibitor, in preclinical models of AML. In AML cell lines and primary AML samples, TAK-243 induced cell death and inhibited clonogenic growth. In contrast, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells were more resistant. TAK-243 preferentially bound to UBA1 over the related E1 enzymes UBA2, UBA3, and UBA6 in intact AML cells. Inhibition of UBA1 with TAK-243 decreased levels of ubiquitylated proteins, increased markers of proteotoxic stress and DNA damage stress. In vivo, TAK-243 reduced leukemic burden and targeted leukemic stem cells without evidence of toxicity. Finally, we selected populations of AML cells resistant to TAK-243 and identified missense mutations in the adenylation domain of UBA1. Thus, our data demonstrate that TAK-243 targets AML cells and stem cells and support a clinical trial of TAK-243 in this patient population. Moreover, we provide insight into potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to UBA1 inhibitors.","['Barghout, Samir H', 'Patel, Parasvi S', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Xu, G Wei', 'Kavanagh, Simon', 'Halgas, Ondrej', 'Zarabi, Sara F', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Jeyaraju, Danny V', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Brennan, Shawn', 'Hyer, Marc L', 'Berger, Allison', 'Traore, Tary', 'Milhollen, Michael', 'Smith, Adam C', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Pai, Emil F', 'Hakem, Razq', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Barghout SH', 'Patel PS', 'Wang X', 'Xu GW', 'Kavanagh S', 'Halgas O', 'Zarabi SF', 'Gronda M', 'Hurren R', 'Jeyaraju DV', 'MacLean N', 'Brennan S', 'Hyer ML', 'Berger A', 'Traore T', 'Milhollen M', 'Smith AC', 'Minden MD', 'Pai EF', 'Hakem R', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Oncology Drug Discovery Unit, Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Instituto de Pesquisa Pele Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada. aaron.schimmer@utoronto.ca.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. aaron.schimmer@utoronto.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sulfides', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/06/10 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2018/06/10 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0167-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0167-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jan;33(1):37-51. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0167-0.

However, a pilot study of treatment with oral arsenic realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF) plus ATRA without chemotherapy, which has a more convenient route of administration than the standard intravenous regimen, showed high efficacy. In this study, we compare an oral RIF plus ATRA treatment regimen with the standard intravenous arsenic trioxide plus ATRA treatment regimen in patients with non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia. METHODS: We did a multicentre, non-inferiority, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 14 centres in China. Patients aged 18-70 years with newly diagnosed (within 7 days) non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia, and a WHO performance status of 2 or less were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive treatment with RIF-ATRA or arsenic trioxide-ATRA as the induction and consolidation therapy. Randomisation was done centrally with permuted blocks and stratification according to trial centre and was implemented through an interactive web response system. RIF (60 mg/kg bodyweight daily in an oral divided dose) or arsenic trioxide (0.15 mg/kg daily in an intravenous dose) and ATRA (25 mg/m(2) daily in an oral divided dose) were used until complete remission was achieved. The home-based consolidation therapy was RIF (60 mg/kg daily in an oral divided dose) or intravenous arsenic trioxide (0.15 mg/kg daily in an intravenous dose) in a 4-week on 4-week off regimen for four cycles and ATRA (25 mg/m(2) daily in an oral divided dose) in a 2-week on 2-week off regimen for seven cycles. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was event-free survival at 2 years. A non-inferiority margin of -10% was used to assess non-inferiority. Primary analyses were done in a modified intention-to-treat population of all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment and the per-protocol population. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-TRC-13004054), and the trial is complete. FINDINGS: Between Feb 13, 2014, and Aug 31, 2015, 109 patients were enrolled and assigned to RIF-ATRA (n=72) or arsenic trioxide-ATRA (n=37). Three patients in the RIF-ATRA and one in the arsenic trioxide-ATRA did not receive their assigned treatment. After a median follow-up of 32 months (IQR 27-36), 67 (97%) of 69 patients in the RIF-ATRA group and 34 (94%) of 36 in the arsenic trioxide-ATRA group had achieved 2-year event-free survival in the modified intention-to-treat population. The percentage difference in event-free survival was 2.7% (95% CI, -5.8 to 11.1). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in event-free survival was greater than the -10% non-inferiority margin, confirming non-inferiority (p=0.0017). Non-inferiority was also confirmed in the per-protocol population. During induction therapy, grade 3-4 hepatic toxic effects (ie, increased liver aspartate aminotransferase or alanine transaminase concentrations) were reported in six (9%) of 69 patients in the RIF-ATRA group versus five (14%) of 36 patients in the arsenic trioxide-ATRA group; grade 3-4 infection was reported in 15 (23%) of 64 versus 15 (42%) of 36 patients. Two patients in the arsenic trioxide-ATRA group died during induction therapy (one from haemorrhage and one from thrombocytopenia). INTERPRETATION: Oral RIF plus ATRA is not inferior to intravenous arsenic trioxide plus ATRA for the treatment of patients with non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia. This study suggests that a completely oral, chemotherapy-free model might be an alternative to the standard intravenous treatment for patients with non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia.

Determining tumor activity under hypoxia may identify chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with aggressive clinical course and predict response to chemo-immunotherapy (CIT). A metabolic score was generated by determining pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, key enzymes of glycolysis, ex vivo in primary CLL samples under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This score was further correlated with clinical endpoints and response to CIT in 96 CLL patients. 45 patients were classified as metabolic high risk (HR), 51 as low risk (LR). Treatment-free survival (TFS) was significantly shorter in HR patients (median 394 vs 723days, p=.021). 15 HR patients and 14 LR patients received CIT after sample acquisition.

However, the human genome encodes more than 60 different bromodomains and most of them remain unexplored. RESULTS: We report that the bromodomains of the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/EP300 are critical to sustain the proliferation of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. EP300 is very abundant at super-enhancers in K562 and is coincident with sites of GATA1 and MYC occupancy. In accordance, CREBBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitors interfere with GATA1- and MYC-driven transcription, causing the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The CREBBP/CBP30 bromodomain inhibitor CBP30 displaces CREBBP and EP300 from GATA1 and MYC binding sites at enhancers, resulting in a decrease in the levels of histone acetylation at these regulatory regions and consequently reduced gene expression of critical genes controlled by these transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that inhibition of CREBBP/EP300 bromodomains can interfere with oncogene-driven transcriptional programs in cancer cells and consequently hold therapeutic potential.","['Garcia-Carpizo, Veronica', 'Ruiz-Llorente, Sergio', 'Sarmentero, Jacinto', 'Grana-Castro, Osvaldo', 'Pisano, David G', 'Barrero, Maria J']","['Garcia-Carpizo V', 'Ruiz-Llorente S', 'Sarmentero J', 'Grana-Castro O', 'Pisano DG', 'Barrero MJ']","['CNIO-Lilly Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'CNIO-Lilly Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'CNIO-Lilly Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'CNIO-Lilly Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029, Madrid, Spain. mjbarrero@cnio.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180608,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bromodomains', '*Cancer', '*Epigenetics', '*Proliferation']",2018/06/10 06:00,2018/10/06 06:00,['2018/06/10 06:00'],"['2018/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-018-0197-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13072-018-0197-x [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018 Jun 8;11(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s13072-018-0197-x.,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",,PMC5992658,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have reported that the nature of invasive cells could be changed after this phenomenon, causing chemotherapy resistance. It has been demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/MMP-9, as a metastasis biomarker, can fortify the metastatic potential of leukemia. Furthermore, investigations have confirmed the inhibitory effect of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid on the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: In the present study, the inhibitory effect of WIN 55212-2 (a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist) and AM251 (a selective CB1 receptor antagonist) on K562 cells, as a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) model, was evaluated using MTT and invasion assay. Expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were then assessed by Western blot analysis. Results: The data obtained from MTT assay showed that WIN 55212-2 could attenuate cell proliferation; however, AM251 was less effective in this regard. Our results showed that WIN 55212-2 considerably reduced cancer cell invasiveness, while AM251 exhibited a converse effect. Moreover, CB1 activation resulted in decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Conclusion: Our findings clarifies that CB1 receptors are responsible for anti-invasive effects in the K562 cell line.","['Gholizadeh, Fatemeh', 'Ghahremani, Mohammad Hossein', 'Aliebrahimi, Shima', 'Shadboorestan, Amir', 'Ostad, Seyed Nasser']","['Gholizadeh F', 'Ghahremani MH', 'Aliebrahimi S', 'Shadboorestan A', 'Ostad SN']","['Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Poisoning Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Poisoning Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Poisoning Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Poisoning Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180609,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,IM,"['Benzoxazines/*pharmacology', 'Cannabinoids/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/*agonists/*analysis/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AM251', '*Cannabinoid receptor', '*Leukemia', '*Matrix metalloproteinases', '*WIN 55212-2']",2018/06/10 06:00,2019/05/03 06:00,['2018/06/10 06:00'],"['2018/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2019 Mar;23(2):153-8.

The present work was aimed to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for its anticancer attributes. Our findings suggest that indirubin inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells with an IC50 of 40muM and induced a mitotic block. At concentrations higher than its IC50, indirubin exerted a moderate depolymerizing effect on the interphase microtubular network and spindle microtubules in HeLa cells. Studies with goat brain tubulin indicated that indirubin bound to tubulin at a single site with a dissociation constant of 26+/-3muM and inhibited the in vitro polymerization of tubulin into microtubules in the presence of glutamate as well as microtubule-associated proteins. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation studies indicate that indirubin stably binds to tubulin at the interface of the alpha-beta tubulin heterodimer. Further, indirubin stabilized the binding of colchicine on tubulin and promoted the cysteine residue modification by 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, indicating towards alteration of tubulin conformation upon binding. In addition, we found that indirubin synergistically enhanced the anti-mitotic and anti-proliferative activity of vinblastine, a known microtubule-targeted agent. Collectively our studies indicate that perturbation of microtubule polymerization dynamics could be one of the possible mechanisms behind the anti-cancer activities of indirubin.","['Mohan, Lakshmi', 'Raghav, Darpan', 'Ashraf, Shabeeba M', 'Sebastian, Jomon', 'Rathinasamy, Krishnan']","['Mohan L', 'Raghav D', 'Ashraf SM', 'Sebastian J', 'Rathinasamy K']","['School of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'School of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, India.

The anti-cancer activities of gallic acid have been shown in various cancers but its underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we show Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration as a mechanism of gallic acid's action in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gallic acid significantly induces apoptosis of AML cell lines, primary mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD34 stem/progenitors isolated form AML patients via caspase-dependent pathway. It also significantly enhances two standard AML chemotherapeutic agents' efficacy in vitro cell culture system and in vivo xenograft model. Gallic acid inhibits dose- and time-dependent mitochondrial respiration, leading to decreased ATP production and oxidative stress. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt restores gallic acid-mediated inhibition of mTOR signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy crisis and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial respiration inhibition by gallic acid is a consequence of Akt/mTOR signaling suppression.

Gene expression of Cyt-B was found to be significantly higher for any variation (somatic or germline) at positions 16,192 and 16,327 while it was significantly lower for variations at positions 16,051 and 207. Any variation at positions 152, 207 and 513 significantly decreased COX1 expression while those at positions 16,051 and 152 attenuated ATP6 expression. This first study evaluated type and overall pattern of D-loop variations in AML, and also showed that some of these variations in D loop region might have an effect on the mitochondrial-encoded genes which is new and valuable information in AML genomics.","['Tyagi, Anudishi', 'Pramanik, Raja', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Ali, Safdar', 'Bakhshi, Radhika', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Singh, Archna', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Tyagi A', 'Pramanik R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Ali S', 'Bakhshi R', 'Chopra A', 'Singh A', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology; Dr. B.

The present study aimed to analyse the relation between a medical history of asthma or eczema and childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) in light of potential candidate gene-environment interactions. METHODS: Analyses were based on a subset of 434 cases of ALL and 442 controls successfully genotyped and of European ancestry children enrolled in a French population-based case-control study conducted in 2003-2004. Information about medical history was obtained during a standardized interview with the mothers. Candidate polymorphisms in genes of the Th2 cytokines IL4, IL10, IL13 and IL4-receptor, were genotyped or imputed. RESULTS: None of the variant alleles were directly associated with childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia. A medical history of asthma or eczema was reported more often in the control group (OR=0.7 [0.5-1.0]). This association was mostly seen in the group of children not carrying the IL13-rs20541 variant allele (Interaction Odds Ratio IOR 1.9, p-interaction=0.07) and in those carrying the IL10 triple variant haplotype (IOR 0.5, p-interaction=0.04). No interaction was observed with the candidate polymorphisms in IL4 and IL4R. CONCLUSION: This study provides a new insight into the relationship between allergic symptoms and childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia, by suggesting this inverse association could be limited to children carrying certain genetic polymorphisms. If confirmed, these results could help better understand the biological mechanisms involved in the development of childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia.","['Bonaventure, A', 'Orsi, L', 'Rudant, J', 'Goujon-Bellec, S', 'Leverger, G', 'Baruchel, A', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Nelken, B', 'Pasquet, M', 'Michel, G', 'Sirvent, N', 'Chastagner, P', 'Ducassou, S', 'Thomas, C', 'Besse, C', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Bonaventure A', 'Orsi L', 'Rudant J', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Nelken B', 'Pasquet M', 'Michel G', 'Sirvent N', 'Chastagner P', 'Ducassou S', 'Thomas C', 'Besse C', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","[""INSERM, Universite Paris-Descartes, Universite Sorbonne-Paris-Cite, CRESS U1153, EPICEA-Epidemiologie des cancers de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, Villejuif, France; INSERM, RNCE-National Registry of Childhood Cancers, Villejuif, France; Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.

METHODS: The impact of FQPx on bloodstream infections (BSI) during neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy for haematologic malignancies was evaluated through a multicenter hospital infection surveillance system for the period 2009-2014. RESULTS: Among 8755 patients (4223 allogeneic [allo-] HSCT, 3602 autologous [auto-] HSCT, 930 high-dose chemotherapy for acute leukemia [HDC]), 5302 (61%) had received FQPx. Administration of FQPx was associated with fewer Gram-negative BSI in the overall study cohort patients (4.6%vs. 7.7%, adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR] 0.59, 95%CI 0.50-0.70), in patients with HDC (3.7%vs. 9.2%, adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR] 0.40, 95%CI 0.22-0.70) and auto-HSCT patients (4%vs. 9%, aSHR 0.43, 95%CI 0.33-0.56). In HDC patients, FQPx was associated with a marked reduction in all-cause mortality during neutropenia (2.3%vs. 7.8%, aSHR 0.30, 95%CI 0.15-0.58). Patients receiving FQPx had significantly more BSIs due to ESBL-positive Enterobacteriacea (0.8vs. 0.3%, RR 2.2, 95%CI 1.17-4.26). BSIs by MRSA (n=5) and VRE (n=11) were rare in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: As used in the participating centers, FQPx was associated with reduced Gram-negative BSI and improved survival among HDC patients. Among HSCT patients, the benefits were less clear. If adapted to local resistance patterns and patient characteristics, FQPx still may be useful in the management of patients with haematologic malignancies.","['Kern, Winfried V', 'Weber, Susanne', 'Dettenkofer, Markus', 'Kaier, Klaus', 'Bertz, Hartmut', 'Behnke, Michael', 'Weisser, Maja', 'Gotting, Tim', 'Widmer, Andreas F', 'Theilacker, Christian']","['Kern WV', 'Weber S', 'Dettenkofer M', 'Kaier K', 'Bertz H', 'Behnke M', 'Weisser M', 'Gotting T', 'Widmer AF', 'Theilacker C']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, University Hospital and Medical Center, and Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany .

However, VCR's full therapeutic potential has been limited by its dose-limiting neurotoxicity, classically resulting in autonomic and peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy. Therefore, we developed a targeted liposomal drug delivery system (sgc8/VCR-Lipo) for improving the therapeutic effects of VCR against leukemia and reducing its systematic adverse effects. sgc8/VCR-Lipo could specifically bind to CCRF-CEM cells and significantly inhibit proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The sgc8/VCR-Lipo nanoparticles may improve the anti-tumor efficacy of VCR and reduce side effects induced by non-specific drug release. These results suggest that our findings provide scientific evidence for developing novel aptamer-based targeted drug delivery systems for leukemia treatment.","['Duan, Siliang', 'Yu, Yating', 'Lai, Chunhui', 'Wang, Dujin', 'Wang, Yiwei', 'Xue, Dabing', 'Hu, Zixi', 'Lu, Xiaoling']","['Duan S', 'Yu Y', 'Lai C', 'Wang D', 'Wang Y', 'Xue D', 'Hu Z', 'Lu X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,IM,"['Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Liberation', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Vincristine']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/04/20 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2018.2530 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2018 May 1;14(5):910-921. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2530.,"['0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFIs are a significant complication in the management of immunocompromised cancer patients; such infections are associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality, particularly in many South-Asian countries, where IFI rates are increasing. We retrospectively analyzed IFI incidence data from 105 patients with newly diagnosed AML at a single center undergoing their first course of induction chemotherapy without primary antifungal prophylaxis between November 2008 and December 2014. Of 21 cases documented as proven/provable IFIs 16 (76%) were invasive aspergillosis, 2 (10%) were mucormycosis infections, and 3 (14%) were proven yeast infections. The lung was the most commonly affected site (n = 16; 76%); 2 patients (10%) developed fungal sinusitis. IFI cases were more often males (P = 0.020). In multivariate analysis, patients with neutropenia lasting>30 days were more than twice as likely to develop IFI (OR, 2.24 [95% CI, 2.81-31.11], P<0.001). We also confirmed patients with smoker and receiving parenteral nutrition during chemotherapy were significant associated with IFIs. Our findings suggest that antifungal prophylaxis should be considered for patients with AML during induction chemotherapy, particularly in patients from Southeastern Asia, an area of potentially high IFI rates. We recommend that clinicians determine which patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML are at high risk of developing IFI, to allow for targeted therapeutic prophylaxis.","['Lien, Ming-Yu', 'Chou, Chia-Hui', 'Lin, Ching-Chan', 'Bai, Li-Yuan', 'Chiu, Chang-Fang', 'Yeh, Su-Peng', 'Ho, Mao-Wang']","['Lien MY', 'Chou CH', 'Lin CC', 'Bai LY', 'Chiu CF', 'Yeh SP', 'Ho MW']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Infection Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Clinic of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Infection Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180608,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197851 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-22358 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jun 8;13(6):e0197851. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197851. eCollection 2018.,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],,PMC5993235,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0795-3504'],,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.5632633/'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minutes of exposure to Moxetumomab achieves similar cell killing than hours of exposure to a novel deimmunized variant against some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Because blood levels fall quickly, Moxetumomab is more than 1000-fold more active than the deimmunized variant in vivo. We aimed to identify which part of Moxetumomab increases in vivo efficacy and generated five immunotoxins, tested time-dependent activity, and determined the efficacy in a KOPN-8 xenograft model. Full domain II shortened the time cells had to be exposed to die to only a few minutes for some ALL; deimmunized domain III consistently extended the time. Against KOPN-8, full domain II accelerated time to arrest protein synthesis by three-fold and tripled PARP-cleavage. In vivo efficacy was increased by more than 10-fold by domain II and increasing size, and therefore half-life enhanced efficacy two- to four-fold. In summary, in vivo efficacy is determined by the time cells have to be exposed to immunotoxin to die and serum half-life. Thus, domain II is most critical for activity against some ALL treated with bolus doses; however, immunotoxins lacking all but the furin-cleavage site of domain II may be advantageous when treating continuously.","['Muller, Fabian', 'Cunningham, Tyler', 'Beers, Richard', 'Bera, Tapan K', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Muller F', 'Cunningham T', 'Beers R', 'Bera TK', 'Wayne AS', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. fabian.mueller@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen 91054, Germany. fabian.mueller@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. cunningham.tyler@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. beersr@dc37a.nci.nih.gov.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. berat@mail.nih.gov.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. awayne@chla.usc.edu."", 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. pastani@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180521,Switzerland,Toxins (Basel),Toxins,101530765,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Toxins/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Protein Domains', 'Pseudomonas', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*CD22', '*Moxetumomab pasudotox', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*immunotoxin', '*mantle cell lymphoma', '*targeted therapy']",2018/06/09 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['toxins10050210 [pii]', '10.3390/toxins10050210 [doi]']",epublish,Toxins (Basel). 2018 May 21;10(5). pii: toxins10050210. doi: 10.3390/toxins10050210.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)']",,PMC5983266,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9223-0270'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is considered to be a master regulator of hematopoiesis and has been regarded as a tumor suppressor because it is essential for definitive hematopoiesis in vertebrates. It is one of the most frequent target genes of chromosomal translocation in leukemia, and germ line mutation of RUNX1 causes familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies. Somatic cell mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, including those of RUNX1, are observed in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia at a high frequency. In addition, recent studies reported by us and other groups suggested that WT RUNX1 is needed for survival and proliferation of certain types of leukemia. In this review, we describe the significance and paradoxical requirement of RUNX1 tumor suppressor in hematological malignancies based on recent findings such as ""Genetic compensation of RUNX family transcription factors in leukemia,"" ""RUNX1 inhibition-induced inhibitory effects on leukemia cells through p53 activation"" and our novel promising theory ""Cluster regulation of RUNX (CROX)"" through the RUNX gene switch method using pyrrole-imidazole polyamides as a new technique that could contribute to the next generation of leukemia treatment strategies.","['Kamikubo, Yasuhiko']",['Kamikubo Y'],"['Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CBFbeta', 'RUNX cluster', 'leukemia', 'p53', 'polyamides']",2018/06/09 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13664 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Aug;109(8):2358-2363. doi: 10.1111/cas.13664.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,PMC6113440,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2761-8508'],"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Mutations have been documented in genes associated with hematological cancers and in non-driver candidates. These mutations are present at low frequency in the majority of individuals after middle-age, and principally affect the epigenetic modifiers DNMT3A and TET2. In 10%-40% of cases, the clone will progress to meet the diagnostic criteria for Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential, which is associated with an increased risk of hematological cancer and cardiovascular mortality. Blood cell parameters appear unmodified in these individuals, but a minority of them will develop a hematologic malignancy. At this time, the factors put forward as potentially influencing the risk of cancer development are clone size, specific gene, specific mutation, and the number of mutations. Specific stress on hematopoiesis also gives rise to clonal expansion. Genotoxic exposure (such as chemotherapy), or immune attack (as in aplastic anemia) selects/provides a fitness advantage to clones with a context-specific signature. Clonal hematopoiesis offers a new opportunity to understand the biology and adaptation mechanisms of aging hematopoiesis and provides insight into the mechanisms underlying malignant transformation. Furthermore, it might shed light on common denominators of age-associated medical conditions and help devise global strategies that will impact the prevention of hematologic cancers and promote healthy aging.

For over four decades, standard induction therapy with intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML had remained unchanged. However, for most patients, standard therapy continues to have its shortcomings, especially for elderly patients who may not be able to tolerate the complications from intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. New research into the development of targeted and alternative therapies has led to a new era in AML therapy. For the nearly 20% of diagnoses harboring a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2), potential treatment options have undergone a paradigm shift away from intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy and towards targeted therapy alone or in combination with lower intensity chemotherapy. The first FDA approved IDH2 inhibitor was enasidenib in 2017. In addition, IDH1 inhibitors are in ongoing clinical studies, and the oral BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax shows preliminary efficacy in this subset of patients. These new tools aim to improve outcomes and change the treatment paradigm for elderly patients with IDH mutant AML. However, the challenge of how to best incorporate these agents into standard practice remains.","['Buege, Michael J', 'DiPippo, Adam J', 'DiNardo, Courtney D']","['Buege MJ', 'DiPippo AJ', 'DiNardo CD']","['Pharmacy Clinical Programs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mjbuege@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ajdipippo@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

We previously reported the efficacy and safety of R-THP-COP consisting of rituximab (R), THP, cyclophosphamide (CPA), vincristine (VCR), and prednisolone (PSL) for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in phase 2 studies. Here, we prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of the R-THP-COP and standard R-CHOP regimen (consisting of R, CPA, DOX, VCR, and PSL) in a noninferiority phase 3 trial. This prospective, randomized phase 3 study included patients younger than 70 years of age with previously untreated DLBCL. The regimen consisted of R (day 1), DOX, or THP (day 3), CPA (day 3), VCR (day 3), and PSL for 5 days every 3 weeks for 6 to 8 cycles. Between July 5, 2006 and June 11, 2013, 81 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups (R-CHOP group, 40 patients; R-THP-COP group, 41 patients). R-THP-COP was noninferior to R-CHOP, as assessed by the primary endpoint of complete response rate (85% vs 85% respectively). With a median follow-up of 75.2 months, the 5-year overall survival was 87% in the R-CHOP group and 82% in the R-THP-COP group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31-2.49; P = .82). The 5-year progression-free survival was 74% in the R-CHOP group and 79% in the R-THP-COP group (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.56-3.55; P = .49). No grade 3 cardiac side effects were observed in either group. No serious late adverse reactions were observed in either group, with the exception of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia in the R-THP-COP group.

To date, analysis tools that can identify and compare recurrent fusion genes across multiple samples have not been available to researchers. To address this deficiency, we developed Co-occurrence Fusion (Co-fuse), a new and easy to use software tool that enables biologists to merge RNA-seq information, allowing them to identify recurrent fusion genes, without the need for exhaustive data processing. Notably, Co-fuse is based on pattern mining and statistical analysis which enables the identification of hidden patterns of recurrent fusion genes. In this report, we show that Co-fuse can be used to identify 2 distinct groups within a set of 49 leukemic cell lines based on their recurrent fusion genes: a multiple myeloma (MM) samples-enriched cluster and an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples-enriched cluster. Our experimental results further demonstrate that Co-fuse can identify known driver fusion genes (e.g., IGH-MYC, IGH-WHSC1) in MM, when compared to AML samples, indicating the potential of Co-fuse to aid the discovery of yet unknown driver fusion genes through cohort comparisons. Additionally, using a 272 primary glioma sample RNA-seq dataset, Co-fuse was able to validate recurrent fusion genes, further demonstrating the power of this analysis tool to identify recurrent fusion genes. Taken together, Co-fuse is a powerful new analysis tool that can be readily applied to large RNA-seq datasets, and may lead to the discovery of new disease subgroups and potentially new driver genes, for which, targeted therapies could be developed.

It is estimated that up to 90% of asthmatics are atopic and have an allergy trigger for asthmatic episodes. In order to assess the risk of allergy induction associated with inhalation exposure, animal models of protein allergy have been developed. These models have been used both to identify proteins as allergens and to assess their relative potency. Often these research situations include allergens that are not well characterized or are unknown. In these situations, specific allergens are not available to be evaluated by more well-known assays (such as ELISAs), and developing a specific assay to evaluate an extract or mixture for an unknown or potential allergen is very time consuming and generally requires purified antigen/allergen. Additionally, when the comparison of the relative potency of multiple extracts is of interest, a common/generic platform is necessary. A more generic method, the rat basophil leukemia cell assay (RBL assay), has been developed which provides insight into the allergenicity of extracts and mixtures as well as providing a common platform for relative potency comparison between/among these complex allergen sources.","['Ward, Marsha D W', 'Copeland, Lisa B']","['Ward MDW', 'Copeland LB']","['Cardiopulmonary-Immunotoxicology Branch, National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. mwilburnw@gmail.com.', 'Cardiopulmonary-Immunotoxicology Branch, National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Pollen/immunology', 'Rats', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allergic asthma', '*Cross-reactivity', '*Mouse model', '*RBL assay', '*Relative allergenicity']",2018/06/09 06:00,2019/03/05 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-8549-4_22 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2018;1803:371-381. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8549-4_22.,"['0 (Antigens)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To describe treatments and outcomes according to comorbidities in patients with ARDS admitted to 19 ICUs (1997-2014). METHODS: Patients were grouped based on comorbidities. Determinants of day-28 mortality were identified by multivariable Cox analysis stratified on center. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 4953 ARDS patients, 2545 (51.4%) had major comorbidities; the proportion with major comorbidities increased after 2008. Hematological malignancy was associated with severe ARDS and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia. COPD, HIV infection, and hematological malignancy were associated with a lower likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation on the admission day. Admission-day SOFA score was higher in patients with major comorbidities, who more often received vasopressors, dialysis, or treatment-limitation decisions. Day-28 mortality was 33.7% overall, 27.2% in patients without major comorbidities, and 31.1% (COPD) to 56% (hematological malignancy) in patients with major comorbidities. By multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in patients with COPD and higher in those with chronic heart failure, solid tumors, or hematological malignancies. Mortality was independently associated with PaO2/FiO2 and PaCO2 on day 1, ARDS of pulmonary origin, worse SOFA score, and ICU-acquired events. CONCLUSIONS: Half the patients with ARDS had major comorbidities, which were associated with severe ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction, and day-28 mortality. These findings do not support the exclusion of ARDS patients with severe comorbidities from randomized clinical trials. Trials in ARDS patients with whatever comorbidities are warranted.","['Azoulay, Elie', 'Lemiale, Virginie', 'Mourvillier, Bruno', 'Garrouste-Orgeas, Maite', 'Schwebel, Carole', 'Ruckly, Stephane', 'Argaud, Laurent', 'Cohen, Yves', 'Souweine, Bertrand', 'Papazian, Laurent', 'Reignier, Jean', 'Marcotte, Guillaume', 'Siami, Shidasp', 'Kallel, Hatem', 'Darmon, Michael', 'Timsit, Jean-Francois']","['Azoulay E', 'Lemiale V', 'Mourvillier B', 'Garrouste-Orgeas M', 'Schwebel C', 'Ruckly S', 'Argaud L', 'Cohen Y', 'Souweine B', 'Papazian L', 'Reignier J', 'Marcotte G', 'Siami S', 'Kallel H', 'Darmon M', 'Timsit JF']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, AP-HP, Saint-Louis hospital, ECSTRA Team, Biostatistics and CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, UMR 1153 (Center of Epidemiology and Biostatistic Sorbonne Paris Cite, CRESS), INSERM, Paris Diderot Sorbonne University, Paris, France. elie.azoulay@aphp.fr.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, AP-HP, Saint-Louis hospital, ECSTRA Team, Biostatistics and CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, UMR 1153 (Center of Epidemiology and Biostatistic Sorbonne Paris Cite, CRESS), INSERM, Paris Diderot Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Reanimation Medicale et Infectieuse, Hopital Bichat Claude Bernard, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit, Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Joseph, Paris, France.', 'Service de Reanimation Medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble-Alpes, CS10217, Grenoble Cedex 09, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics, OUTCOMEREA, Bobigny, France.', 'Medical ICU, Edouard Heriot University Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Medical-Surgical ICU, Bobigny University hospital, Paris, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Gabriel Montpied University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Reanimation des Detresses Respiratoires et Infections Severes, Hopital Nord, Aix-Marseille University, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille, Unite de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes (URMITE), UMR CNRS 7278, Marseille, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Nantes University Hospital Center, Nantes, France.', 'Surgical ICU, Edouard Herriot University Hospital, Lyon, France.', ""Reanimation polyvalente-Surveillance Continue-Site d'Etampes, Centre hospitalier Sud Essonne (Etampes), Paris, France."", 'Medical Surgical ICU, Centre hospitalier de Cayenne, Guyane, France.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, AP-HP, Saint-Louis hospital, ECSTRA Team, Biostatistics and CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, UMR 1153 (Center of Epidemiology and Biostatistic Sorbonne Paris Cite, CRESS), INSERM, Paris Diderot Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'UMR 1137, Infection Antimicrobials Modelling Evolution (IAME) Team 5, Decision Sciences in Infectious Diseases (DeSCID), Control and Care, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inserm/Paris Diderot University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180607,United States,Intensive Care Med,Intensive care medicine,7704851,IM,"['Adult', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Databases, Factual', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute respiratory failure', '*Cancer', '*Leukemia', '*Mortality', '*Ventilation']",2018/06/09 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00134-018-5209-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00134-018-5209-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Intensive Care Med. 2018 Jul;44(7):1050-1060. doi: 10.1007/s00134-018-5209-6.

By adjusting the frequency range of an FM wave to cover the crossover frequency f X in the real part of the Clausius-Mossotti factor, our theory predicts the reversal of the dielectrophoretic force each time the instantaneous frequency periodically traverses f X . In fact, we observed periodic U-turns of vesicles, leukemia cells, and red blood cells that undergo FM wave dielectrophoresis (FM-DEP). It is also suggested by our theory that the video tracking of the U-turns due to FM-DEP is available for the agile and accurate measurement of f X . The FM-DEP method requires a short duration, less than 30 s, while applying the FM wave to observe several U-turns, and the agility in measuring f X is of much use for not only salty cell suspensions but also nanoparticles because the electric-field-induced solvent flow is suppressed as much as possible. The accuracy of f X has been verified using two types of experiment. First, we measured the attractive force exerted on a single vesicle experiencing alternating-current dielectrophoresis (AC-DEP) at various frequencies of sinusoidal electric fields. The frequency dependence of the dielectrophoretic force yields f X as a characteristic frequency at which the force vanishes. Comparing the AC-DEP result of f X with that obtained from the FM-DEP method, both results of f X were found to coincide with each other. Second, we investigated the conductivity dependencies of f X for three kinds of cell by changing the surrounding electrolytes. From the experimental results, we evaluated simultaneously both of the cytoplasmic conductivities and the membrane capacitances using an elaborate theory on the single-shell model of biological cells. While the cytoplasmic conductivities, similar for these cells, were slightly lower than the range of previous reports, the membrane capacitances obtained were in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature.","['Frusawa, Hiroshi']",['Frusawa H'],"['School of Environmental Science & EngineeringKochi University of Technology, Tosa-Yamada, Kochi, 782-8502, Japan. frusawa.hiroshi@kochi-tech.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180607,United States,Nanoscale Res Lett,Nanoscale research letters,101279750,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell', 'Crossover frequency', 'Dielectrophoresis', 'Frequency-modulated wave', 'Spectroscopy', 'The Clausius-Mossotti factor', 'Vesicle']",2018/06/09 06:00,2018/06/09 06:01,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s11671-018-2583-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s11671-018-2583-5 [pii]']",epublish,Nanoscale Res Lett. 2018 Jun 7;13(1):169. doi: 10.1186/s11671-018-2583-5.,,,PMC5991112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukodepletion provides optimum results, nonetheless there are cases where irradiation is recommended for some groups of hematological patients such as the ones with chronic graft-vs-host disease, congenital cellular immunodeficiency, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The European guidelines suggest irradiation doses from 25 to 50 Gray (Ggamma). We evaluated the effect of different prescribed doses (15 to 50 Ggamma) of X-ray irradiation on fresh leukodepleted RBCs bags using a novel protocol that provides a controlled irradiation. Biochemical assays integrated with RBCs metabolome profile, assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were performed on RBC units supernatant, during 14 days storage. Metabolome analysis evidenced a direct correlation between concentration increase of three metabolites, glycine, glutamine and creatine, and irradiation dose. Higher doses (35 and 50 Ggamma) effect on RBC mean corpuscular volume, hemolysis, and ammonia concentration are considerable after 7 and 14 days of storage. Our data show that irradiation with 50 Ggamma should be avoided and we suggest that 35 Ggamma should be the upper limit. Moreover, we suggest for leukodepleted RBCs units the irradiation with the prescribed dose of 15 Ggamma, value at center of bag, and ranging between 13.35-15 Ggamma, measured over the entire bag volume, may guarantee the same benefits of a 25 Ggamma dose assuring, in addition, a better quality of RBCs.","['Baroni, Fabio', 'Marraccini, Chiara', 'Merolle, Lucia', 'Piccagli, Vando', 'Lambertini, Daniele', 'Iori, Mauro', 'Fasano, Tommaso', 'Casali, Emanuela', 'Spisni, Alberto', 'Baricchi, Roberto', 'Pertinhez, Thelma A']","['Baroni F', 'Marraccini C', 'Merolle L', 'Piccagli V', 'Lambertini D', 'Iori M', 'Fasano T', 'Casali E', 'Spisni A', 'Baricchi R', 'Pertinhez TA']","['Transfusion Medicine Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Protein Chemistry, Merck, Guidonia Montecelio, Rome, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Physics Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Physics Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Physics Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy. iori.mauro@ausl.re.it.', 'Clinical and Endocrinology Laboratory, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Unit, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180607,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Preservation/methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolome/*radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation Dosage', '*X-Rays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ammonium', 'Bone marrow transplant', 'Leukemia', 'NMR metabolomics', 'RBC metabolome', 'X-ray irradiation']",2018/06/09 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3386-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3386-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Oct;97(10):1909-1917. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3386-6.

In cases of unexplained retinal changes with hemorrhage and cotton wool spots, an underlying hematological disease should be suspected and the appropriate diagnostics should be recommended.","['Rehak, M', 'Feltgen, N', 'Meier, P', 'Wiedemann, P']","['Rehak M', 'Feltgen N', 'Meier P', 'Wiedemann P']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Augenheilkunde, Universitatsklinikum Leipzig, Liebigstr. 10-14, 04103, Leipzig, Deutschland.

Recently, extract of C. campestris had shown moderate antimicrobial properties and cytotoxic effects. In this study, we examined the level of cellular oxidants, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and differentiation induced by hydroalcoholic extract of C. campestris (CCE) (12.5-200 microg/ml), as well as arsenic trioxide (As2O3, 50 microM), in human leukemic (HL60 and NB4) and normal polymorph nuclear cells after 72 hr treatment. Materials and Methods: Resazurin assay was used to determine cell viability following treatment with C. campestris. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic cells were measured by fluorimetry using carboxy 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide (PI), as staining reagents, respectively. The differentiation of leukemic cells was evaluated by Giemsa staining and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction. Results: C. campestris inhibited cell viability with IC50 values of 23.9 microg/ml for HL60 and 60.3 microg/ml for NB4 cells after 72 hr treatment. ROS formation was also concentration-dependently increased following treatment with C. campestris. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased to 88.4% and 62.3% in CCE (200 microg/ml)-treated HL60 and NB4 cells, respectively, which was higher than that of As2O3 (50 microM)-treated leukemic cells (p<0.001). Nonetheless, C. campestris did not induce differentiation of leukemic cells towards granulocytic pattern. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that C. campestris induced apoptosis through ROS production without having differential effect on leukemic cells, in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Understanding of precise signaling pathway by which C. campestris induce apoptosis, needs further research.","['Moradzadeh, Maliheh', 'Hosseini, Azar', 'Rakhshandeh, Hasan', 'Aghaei, Azita', 'Sadeghnia, Hamid Reza']","['Moradzadeh M', 'Hosseini A', 'Rakhshandeh H', 'Aghaei A', 'Sadeghnia HR']","['Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Phytomed,Avicenna journal of phytomedicine,101586220,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cuscuta campestris', 'Differentiation', 'Leukemia', 'ROS']",2018/06/09 06:00,2018/06/09 06:01,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Avicenna J Phytomed. 2018 May-Jun;8(3):237-245.,,,PMC5987438,,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing methods to determine the number of PCs are either subjective or computationally extensive. We review several methods and describe a new R package, PCDimension, that implements additional methods, the most important being an algorithm that extends and automates a graphical Bayesian method. Using simulations, we compared the methods. Our newly automated procedure is competitive with the best methods when considering both accuracy and speed and is the most accurate when the number of objects is small compared with the number of attributes. We applied the method to a proteomics data set from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Proteins in the apoptosis pathway could be explained using 6 PCs. By clustering the proteins in PC space, we were able to replace the PCs by 6 ""biological components,"" 3 of which could be immediately interpreted from the current literature.

Elderly patients represent a particular challenge due to their marked heterogeneity. Many new and highly effective drugs have been introduced in the last few years and results from clinical trials are promising. Besides the availability of novel agents, a careful evaluation of elderly patients showed to be a key factor for the success of therapy. A geriatric assessment is a valid strategy to better stratify patients. In particular, different scores are available today to appropriately assess elderly patients and define their fitness/frailty status. The choice of treatment-transplantation, triplets, doublets, or reduced-dose therapies including novel agents-should depend on the patient's fitness status (fit, intermediate-fit or frail). Second-generation novel agents have also been evaluated as salvage therapy in the elderly, and these new agents certainly represent a further step forward in the treatment armamentarium for elderly patients with multiple myeloma.","['Larocca, Alessandra', 'Dold, Sandra Maria', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Terpos, Evangelos', 'Wasch, Ralph', ""D'Agostino, Mattia"", 'Scheubeck, Sophia', 'Goldschmidt, Hartmut', 'Gay, Francesca', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Ludwig, Heinz', 'Straka, Christian', 'Bringhen, Sara', 'Auner, Holger W', 'Caers, Jo', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'Engelhardt, Monika']","['Larocca A', 'Dold SM', 'Zweegman S', 'Terpos E', 'Wasch R', ""D'Agostino M"", 'Scheubeck S', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Gay F', 'Cavo M', 'Ludwig H', 'Straka C', 'Bringhen S', 'Auner HW', 'Caers J', 'Gramatzki M', 'Offidani M', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Einsele H', 'Boccadoro M', 'Sonneveld P', 'Engelhardt M']","['Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy. alelarocca@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'National and Kapodostrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik, Abteilung Innere Medizin V, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg und National Centrum fur Tumorerkrankungen (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Seragnoli Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '1st Medical Department and Oncology, Wilhelminenspital Wien, Vienna, Austria.', 'Hematology & Oncology, Klinikum Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinica di Ematologia, AOU Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'National and Kapodostrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Myeloma Unit, Division of Hematology, University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180425,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Europe', 'Geriatric Assessment/*methods', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Patient-Centered Care/*standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0142-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0142-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Aug;32(8):1697-1712. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0142-9.

Aberrant changes in specific N-glycans have been observed in leukemia multidrug resistance (MDR). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as key players in the development of AML resistance to chemotherapy. In the present study, the N-glycan profiles of membrane proteins were analyzed from adriamycin (ADR)-resistant U937/ADR cells and sensitive line U937 cells using mass spectrometry (MS). The composition profiling of high-mannose N-glycans differed in U937/ADR and U937 cell lines. Lectin microarray showed that the strong binding of membrane proteins was observed for MAN-M and ConA lectins, which were specific for mannose. These binding were also validated by flow cytometry. Importantly, the alteration of high-mannose N-glycan was further confirmed by detecting the enzyme level of ALG family. The altered level of ALG3 was found corresponding to the drug-resistant phenotype of AML cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-342 was found to be dysregulated and inversely correlated to ALG3 expression, targeting its 3'-UTR. LncRNA FTX was a direct target of miR-342 and positively modulated ALG3 expression by competitively binding miR-342 in AML cell lines. Functionally, we found that FTX directly interacted with miR-342 to regulate ALG3 expression and function, including ADR-resistant cell growth and apoptosis. The observation suggested that high-mannose N-glycans and mannosyltransferase ALG3 affected drug-resistance in AML cells. FTX/miR-342/ALG3 axis could potentially be used for the targets to overcome therapeutic resistance in AML.","['Liu, Bing', 'Ma, Xiaolu', 'Liu, Qianqian', 'Xiao, Yang', 'Pan, Shimeng', 'Jia, Li']","['Liu B', 'Ma X', 'Liu Q', 'Xiao Y', 'Pan S', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116011, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, Liaoning Province, China.', 'College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, Liaoning Province, China. jiali0386@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20180607,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mannose/*metabolism', 'Mannosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0706-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0706-7 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jun 7;9(6):688. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0706-7.,"['0 (MIRN342 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long non-coding RNA FTX, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (ALG3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Mannosyltransferases)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,PMC5992136,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3152-3253'],,"['81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International']",,,,,,,,,['Cell Death Dis. 2020 Feb 12;11(2):122.

Prior studies have demonstrated a lower receipt of chemotherapy with increasing age and comorbidities. We hypothesized that socioeconomic and health system factors also determine the use of chemotherapy. We included 61 775 adults with AML diagnosed between 2003 and 2011 from the National Cancer Database, and performed a multivariable logistic regression model to determine the association between receipt of chemotherapy and several factors. A total of 15 608 patients (25.3%) did not receive chemotherapy. In a multivariable analysis, the likelihood of getting chemotherapy declined with increasing age and comorbidities and among patients with therapy-related and intermediate-/high-risk AML. Other factors associated with a lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy included receipt of care in nonacademic centers, African American race, lower income status, uninsured or Medicare insurance status, and female sex. Compared with the previous studies, our study is novel because it provides data from a large, unselected cohort of patients diagnosed in the United States in recent years, and simultaneously examines the effect of various biological, socioeconomic, and health system factors. The results of our study raise a possibility of leukemia care disparity based on socioeconomic and health system factors. Better understanding of ways such factors may influence receipt of chemotherapy may allow an increase in the use of chemotherapy.","['Bhatt, Vijaya Raj', 'Shostrom, Valerie', 'Gundabolu, Krishna', 'Armitage, James O']","['Bhatt VR', 'Shostrom V', 'Gundabolu K', 'Armitage JO']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018019125 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019125 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 12;2(11):1277-1282. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019125.,,,PMC5998918,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2513-0533'],['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort analysis of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with venetoclax to describe outcomes, toxicities, and treatment selection following venetoclax discontinuation. A total of 141 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were included (98% relapsed/refractory). Median age at venetoclax initiation was 67 years (range 37-91), median prior therapies was 3 (0-11), 81% unmutated IGHV, 45% del(17p), and 26.8% complex karyotype (>/= 3 abnormalities). Prior to venetoclax initiation, 89% received a B-cell receptor antagonist. For tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis, 93% received allopurinol, 92% normal saline, and 45% rasburicase. Dose escalation to the maximum recommended dose of 400 mg daily was achieved in 85% of patients. Adverse events of interest included neutropenia in 47.4%, thrombocytopenia in 36%, tumor lysis syndrome in 13.4%, neutropenic fever in 11.6%, and diarrhea in 7.3%. The overall response rate to venetoclax was 72% (19.4% complete remission). With a median follow up of 7 months, median progression free survival and overall survival for the entire cohort have not been reached. To date, 41 venetoclax treated patients have discontinued therapy and 24 have received a subsequent therapy, most commonly ibrutinib. In the largest clinical experience of venetoclax-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, the majority successfully completed and maintained a maximum recommended dose. Response rates and duration of response appear comparable to clinical trial data. Venetoclax was active in patients with mutations known to confer ibrutinib resistance.

Since the bleeding risk is not linked to the platelet count only, other hemostatic factors must be involved. We studied platelet function in 77 patients with acute leukemia, multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma, who experienced chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Platelets from all patients - independent of disease or treatment type - were to a variable extent compromised in Ca(2+) flux, integrin a beta activation and P-selectin expression when stimulated with a panel(IIb)of(3) agonists. The patients' platelets were also impaired in spreading on fibrinogen. Whereas the Ca(2+) store content was unaffected, the patients' platelets showed ongoing phosphatidylserine exposure, which was not due to apoptotic caspase activity. Interestingly, mitochondrial function was markedly reduced in platelets from a representative subset of patients, as evidenced by a low mitochondrial membrane potential (P<0.001) and low oxygen consumption (P<0.05), while the mitochondrial content was normal. Moreover, the mitochondrial impairments coincided with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (Spearman's rho=-0.459, P=0.012). Markedly, the impairment of platelet function only appeared after two days of chemotherapy, suggesting origination in the megakaryocytes. In patients with bone marrow recovery, platelet function improved. In conclusion, our findings disclose defective receptor signaling related to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, independent of apoptosis, in platelets from cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, explaining the low hemostatic potential of these patients.","['Baaten, Constance C F M J', 'Moenen, Floor C J I', 'Henskens, Yvonne M C', 'Swieringa, Frauke', 'Wetzels, Rick J H', 'van Oerle, Rene', 'Heijnen, Harry F G', 'Ten Cate, Hugo', 'Holloway, Graham P', 'Beckers, Erik A M', 'Heemskerk, Johan W M', 'van der Meijden, Paola E J']","['Baaten CCFMJ', 'Moenen FCJI', 'Henskens YMC', 'Swieringa F', 'Wetzels RJH', 'van Oerle R', 'Heijnen HFG', 'Ten Cate H', 'Holloway GP', 'Beckers EAM', 'Heemskerk JWM', 'van der Meijden PEJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Central Diagnostic Laboratory, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Protein Dynamics, Leibniz Institute for Analytical Sciences - ISAS-e.V., Dortmund, Germany.', 'Central Diagnostic Laboratory, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Central Diagnostic Laboratory, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory for Clinical Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory for Clinical Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Center, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands p.vandermeijden@maastrichtuniversity.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180607,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/diagnosis/*etiology/*metabolism']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.185165 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.185165 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Sep;103(9):1557-1567. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.185165.

Interventions that overcome myeloid differentiation have been shown to be a promising therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase leads to apoptosis and normal differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells, indicating that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a potential differentiation regulator and a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia. By screening a library of natural products, we identified a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, isobavachalcone, derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Psoralea corylifolia Using enzymatic analysis, thermal shift assay, pull down, nuclear magnetic resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, we demonstrate that isobavachalcone inhibits human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase directly, and triggers apoptosis and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. Oral administration of isobavachalcone suppresses subcutaneous HL60 xenograft tumor growth without obvious toxicity. Importantly, our results suggest that a combination of isobavachalcone and adriamycin prolonged survival in an intravenous HL60 leukemia model. In summary, this study demonstrates that isobavachalcone triggers apoptosis and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells via pharmacological inhibition of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Wu, Dang', 'Wang, Wanyan', 'Chen, Wuyan', 'Lian, Fulin', 'Lang, Li', 'Huang, Ying', 'Xu, Yechun', 'Zhang, Naixia', 'Chen, Yinbin', 'Liu, Mingyao', 'Nussinov, Ruth', 'Cheng, Feixiong', 'Lu, Weiqiang', 'Huang, Jin']","['Wu D', 'Wang W', 'Chen W', 'Lian F', 'Lang L', 'Huang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang N', 'Chen Y', 'Liu M', 'Nussinov R', 'Cheng F', 'Lu W', 'Huang J']","['Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, China.', 'Guangdong Institute for Drug Control, Guangzhou, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, China.', 'Cancer and Inflammation Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, MD, USA.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Center for Complex Networks Research and Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA huangjin@ecust.edu.cn wqlu@bio.ecnu.edu.cn chengf@ccf.org.', 'Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, OH, USA.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, China huangjin@ecust.edu.cn wqlu@bio.ecnu.edu.cn chengf@ccf.org.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, China huangjin@ecust.edu.cn wqlu@bio.ecnu.edu.cn chengf@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180607,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chalcones/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Interference', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.188185 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.188185 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Sep;103(9):1472-1483. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.188185.

Extended analysis of RESONATE-2 was conducted to determine long-term efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A total of 269 patients aged >/=65 years with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia without del(17p) were randomized 1:1 to ibrutinib (n=136) or chlorambucil (n=133) on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles. Median ibrutinib treatment duration was 28.5 months. Ibrutinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus chlorambucil (median, not reached vs 15 months; hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.20; P<0.0001). The 24-month progression-free survival was 89% with ibrutinib (97% and 89% in patients with del[11q] and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, respectively). Progression-free survival rates at 24 months were also similar regardless of age (<75 years [88%], >/=75 years [89%]). Overall response rate was 92% (125/136).

Greater quality of life improvements occurred with ibrutinib versus chlorambucil in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (P=0.0013). The most frequent grade >/=3 adverse events were neutropenia (12%), anemia (7%), and hypertension (5%). Rate of discontinuations due to adverse events was 12%. Results demonstrated that first-line ibrutinib for elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia provides sustained response and progression-free survival benefits over chemotherapy, with depth of response improving over time without new toxicity concerns.

Using genetic lineage tracing, we have explored the potential of LMO2 in dictating a T-cell malignant phenotype. We first initiated LMO2 expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and maintained its expression in all hematopoietic cells. These mice develop exclusively aggressive human-like T-ALL In order to uncover a potential exclusive reprogramming effect of LMO2 in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we next showed that transient LMO2 expression is sufficient for oncogenic function and induction of T-ALL The resulting T-ALLs lacked LMO2 and its target-gene expression, and histologically, transcriptionally, and genetically similar to human LMO2-driven T-ALL We next found that during T-ALL development, secondary genomic alterations take place within the thymus. However, the permissiveness for development of T-ALL seems to be associated with wider windows of differentiation than previously appreciated. Restricted Cre-mediated activation of Lmo2 at different stages of B-cell development induces systematically and unexpectedly T-ALL that closely resembled those of their natural counterparts. Together, these results provide a novel paradigm for the generation of tumor T cells through reprogramming in vivo and could be relevant to improve the response of T-ALL to current therapies.","['Garcia-Ramirez, Idoia', 'Bhatia, Sanil', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez, Guillermo', 'Gonzalez-Herrero, Ines', 'Walter, Carolin', 'Gonzalez de Tena-Davila, Sara', 'Parvin, Salma', 'Haas, Oskar',

In 53 adult patients with ALL, we found a significant association of severe neurotoxicity with high pretreatment disease burden, higher peak CAR T-cell expansion, and early and higher elevations of proinflammatory cytokines in blood. Patients with severe neurotoxicity had evidence of blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier disruption correlating with neurotoxicity grade without association with CSF white blood cell count or CAR T-cell quantity in CSF. Proinflammatory cytokines were enriched in CSF during severe neurotoxicity with disproportionately high levels of IL6, IL8, MCP1, and IP10, suggesting central nervous system-specific production. Seizures, seizure-like activity, myoclonus, and neuroimaging characteristics suggested excitatory neurotoxicity, and we found elevated levels of endogenous excitatory agonists in CSF during neurotoxicity.Significance: We detail the neurologic symptoms and blood, CSF, and neuroimaging correlates of neurotoxicity associated with CD19 CAR T cells and identify neurotoxicity risk factors.

Previously, we identified and ontologically modeled over 240 drugs that can induce peripheral neuropathy through mining public drug-related databases and drug labels. However, the ADR mechanisms of these drugs are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to develop an ontology-based literature mining system to identify ADRs from drug labels and to elucidate potential mechanisms of the neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). RESULTS: We developed and applied an ontology-based SciMiner literature mining strategy to mine ADRs from the drug labels provided in the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2017, which included drug labels for 53 neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). We identified an average of 243 ADRs per NID and constructed an ADR-ADR network, which consists of 29 ADR nodes and 149 edges, including only those ADR-ADR pairs found in at least 50% of NIDs. Comparison to the ADR-ADR network of non-NIDs revealed that the ADRs such as pruritus, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, nervousness, asthenia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia were highly enriched in the NID network. Our ChEBI-based ontology analysis identified three benzimidazole NIDs (i.e., lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole), which were associated with 43 ADRs. Based on ontology-based drug class effect definition, the benzimidazole drug group has a drug class effect on all of these 43 ADRs. Many of these 43 ADRs also exist in the enriched NID ADR network. Our Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) classification further found that these 43 benzimidazole-related ADRs were distributed in many systems, primarily in behavioral and neurological, digestive, skin, and immune systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that ontology-based literature mining and network analysis can efficiently identify and study specific group of drugs and their associated ADRs. Furthermore, our analysis of drug class effects identified 3 benzimidazole drugs sharing 43 ADRs, leading to new hypothesis generation and possible mechanism understanding of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy.","['Hur, Junguk', 'Ozgur, Arzucan', 'He, Yongqun']","['Hur J', 'Ozgur A', 'He Y']","['Department of Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND, 58202, USA. junguk.hur@med.und.edu.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, 34342, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. yongqunh@med.umich.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. yongqunh@med.umich.edu.', 'Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. yongqunh@med.umich.edu.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. yongqunh@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180607,England,J Biomed Semantics,Journal of biomedical semantics,101531992,,"['*Biological Ontologies', 'Data Mining/*methods', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced']",,,2018/06/09 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2018/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13326-018-0185-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13326-018-0185-x [pii]']",epublish,J Biomed Semantics. 2018 Jun 7;9(1):17. doi: 10.1186/s13326-018-0185-x.,,,PMC5991464,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0736-2149'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The critical gene, cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2), is rearranged in 5-16% of B-ALL, comprising 50% of Philadelphia-like ALL and cooperates with genomic lesions in the Jak, Mapk and Ras signalling pathways. Children with Down Syndrome (DS) have a predisposition to developing CRLF2 rearranged-ALL which is observed in 60% of DS-ALL patients. These patients experience a poor survival outcome. Mutations of genes involved in epigenetic regulation are more prevalent in DS-ALL patients than non-DS ALL patients, highlighting the potential for alternative treatment strategies. DS-ALL patients also suffer greater treatment-related toxicity from current ALL treatment regimens compared to non-DS-ALL patients. An increased gene dosage of critical genes on chromosome 21 which have roles in purine synthesis and folate transport may contribute. As the genomic landscape of DS-ALL patients is different to non-DS-ALL patients, targeted therapies for individual lesions may improve outcomes. Therapeutically targeting each rearrangement with targeted or combination therapy that will perturb the transforming signalling pathways will likely improve the poor survival rates of this subset of patients.","['Page, Elyse C', 'Heatley, Susan L', 'Yeung, David T', 'Thomas, Paul Q', 'White, Deborah L']","['Page EC', 'Heatley SL', 'Yeung DT', 'Thomas PQ', 'White DL']","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia; School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

Pathogenesis in HIV-suppressed individuals has been attributed to reservoirs of latent-inducible virus in resting CD4+ T cells. Macrophages are persistently infected with HIV but their role as HIV reservoirs in vivo has not been fully explored. Here we show that infection of conventional mice with chimeric HIV, EcoHIV, reproduces physiological conditions for development of disease in people on ART including immunocompetence, stable suppression of HIV replication, persistence of integrated, replication-competent HIV in T cells and macrophages, and manifestation of learning and memory deficits in behavioral tests, termed here murine HIV-NCI. EcoHIV established latent reservoirs in CD4+ T lymphocytes in chronically-infected mice but could be induced by epigenetic modulators ex vivo and in mice. In contrast, macrophages expressed EcoHIV constitutively in mice for up to 16 months; murine leukemia virus (MLV), the donor of gp80 envelope in EcoHIV, did not infect macrophages. Both EcoHIV and MLV were found in brain tissue of infected mice but only EcoHIV induced NCI. Murine HIV-NCI was prevented by antiretroviral prophylaxis but once established neither persistent EcoHIV infection in mice nor NCI could be reversed by long-acting antiretroviral therapy. EcoHIV-infected, athymic mice were more permissive to virus replication in macrophages than were wild-type mice, suffered cognitive dysfunction, as well as increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages infiltrating the brain. Our results suggest an important role of HIV expressing macrophages in HIV neuropathogenesis in hosts with suppressed HIV replication.","['Gu, Chao-Jiang', 'Borjabad, Alejandra', 'Hadas, Eran', 'Kelschenbach, Jennifer', 'Kim, Boe-Hyun', 'Chao, Wei', 'Arancio, Ottavio', 'Suh, Jin', 'Polsky, Bruce', 'McMillan, JoEllyn', 'Edagwa, Benson', 'Gendelman, Howard E', 'Potash, Mary Jane', 'Volsky, David J']","['Gu CJ', 'Borjabad A', 'Hadas E', 'Kelschenbach J', 'Kim BH', 'Chao W', 'Arancio O', 'Suh J', 'Polsky B', 'McMillan J', 'Edagwa B', 'Gendelman HE', 'Potash MJ', 'Volsky DJ']","['Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', ""Department of Medicine, St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, Paterson, New Jersey, United States of America."", 'Department of Medicine, NYU Winthrop Hospital, Mineola, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180607,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Brain/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Disease Reservoirs', 'Female', 'HIV/genetics/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'HIV Infections/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*virology', 'Plasmids', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1007061 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-17-02632 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2018 Jun 7;14(6):e1007061. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007061. eCollection 2018 Jun.,['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)'],,PMC5991655,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5479-5644', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7966-8326', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6666-5801', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6896-5122', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4640-8269', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6788-1752']",,"['P01 DA028555/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH104145/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA037611/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA017618 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA017618/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS034239/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA041931/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA041931 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'NS94146 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 MH062261/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS094146/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH104145 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'DA037611 /NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to describe the monthly trends of EOL medical care, drug therapy, and chemotherapy costs per patient with cancer in the last year of life in the inpatients vs. outpatient setting for the 13 most prevalent cancers in Korea. METHODS: Using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database, we identified the patients who had been treated for the primary diagnoses of one of the 13 most prevalent cancers in Korea and died between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. We calculated the mean monthly costs of medical care, drug therapy, and chemotherapy per patient in the last year of life by cancer site and patient setting (inpatient vs. outpatient). RESULTS: For most cancers, the monthly inpatient costs per patient remain stable or increased gradually from 12 months to 3 months prior to death and then increased steeply from 2 months prior to death. The mean monthly inpatient costs per patient were highest for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) throughout the last year of life; all solid tumors had similar trends of monthly inpatient costs. The mean monthly inpatient costs for AML increased from $5,465 (SD, $5,248) in 12 months prior to death to $15,033 (SD, $11,864) in the last month. The monthly outpatient costs per patient showed similar, gradually decreasing trends for most cancers. The mean outpatient costs were highest for kidney cancer; the costs sharply decreased from $954 (SD, $1,346) in 12 months prior to death to $424 (SD, $736) in the last month. The proportion of inpatients receiving chemotherapy in the last month of life was highest for AML (77%), followed by liver cancer (67%) and breast cancer (56%). CONCLUSION: The monthly inpatient medical care costs per patient with cancer increased as the patient approached death, while the monthly outpatient costs decreased. A considerable proportion of inpatient received chemotherapy in the last month of life. Efforts are needed to optimize EOL care for cancer patients.","['Park, Mihai', 'Song, Inmyung']","['Park M', 'Song I']","['Pharmaceutical Benefits Listing Division, Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, Seoul, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180607,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Resources/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'National Health Programs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/*economics', 'Republic of Korea']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197891 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-01832 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jun 7;13(6):e0197891. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197891. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5991689,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8481-5503', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7772-6617']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the antitumor effects of resveratrol (RES) are linked to its capability to inhibit STAT5 activation in CML cells was investigated. We found that RES inhibited STAT5 activation in K562 and KU812 cell lines; RES also reduced the STAT5 concentration in the nucleus of K562 and KU812 cells. Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor, sodium pervanadate, reversed the RES-induced downregulation of STAT5, suggesting the involvement of a PTP. Indeed, we observed that RES decreased the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2; moreover, the deletion of SHP-1 and SHP-2 genes by siRNA abolished the ability of RES to inhibit STAT5 activation, which suggested the critical role of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 in its possible mechanism of action. RES downregulated the expression of STAT5-regulated gene products such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Cyclin D1, and Mcl-1, and increased the expression of Bax. This correlated with the suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Overall, our results suggest that RES is a blocker of STAT5 activation and thus may be potentially useful for the treatment of CML.","['Li, Qing', 'Zhang, Li', 'Ma, Li', 'Bai, Xue', 'Li, Xin', 'Zhao, Mingfeng', 'Sui, Tao']","['Li Q', 'Zhang L', 'Ma L', 'Bai X', 'Li X', 'Zhao M', 'Sui T']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Nankai District.', ""Clinical Laboratory, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital, Jinnan District, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Nankai District.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Nankai District.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Nankai District.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Nankai District.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Nankai District.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*biosynthesis', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000635 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2018 Aug;29(7):646-651. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000635.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prdm16 is expressed as full-length (fPrdm16) and short (sPrdm16) isoforms, the latter lacking the N-terminal PR domain. The role of both isoforms in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is unclear. We show here that fPrdm16 was critical for HSC maintenance, induced multiple genes involved in GTPase signaling, and repressed inflammation, while sPrdm16 supported B cell development biased toward marginal zone B cells and induced an inflammatory signature. In a mouse model of human MLL-AF9 leukemia, fPrdm16 extended latency, while sPrdm16 shortened latency and induced a strong inflammatory signature, including several cytokines and chemokines that are associated with myelodysplasia and with a worse prognosis in human AML. Finally, in human NPM1-mutant and in MLL-translocated AML, high expression of PRDM16, which negatively impacts outcome, was associated with inflammatory gene expression, thus corroborating the mouse data. Our observations demonstrate distinct roles for Prdm16 isoforms in normal HSCs and AML, and identify sPrdm16 as one of the drivers of prognostically adverse inflammation in leukemia.","['Corrigan, David J', 'Luchsinger, Larry L', 'Justino de Almeida, Mariana', 'Williams, Linda J', 'Strikoudis, Alexandros', 'Snoeck, Hans-Willem']","['Corrigan DJ', 'Luchsinger LL', 'Justino de Almeida M', 'Williams LJ', 'Strikoudis A', 'Snoeck HW']","['Columbia Center of Human Development.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology.', 'Columbia Center of Human Development.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Columbia Center of Human Development.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology.', 'Columbia Center of Human Development.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Columbia Center of Human Development.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Columbia Center of Human Development.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180723,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult stem cells', '*Bone marrow', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Stem cells']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['99862 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI99862 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Aug 1;128(8):3250-3264. doi: 10.1172/JCI99862.

Treatment regimens for DS-ALL patients often include therapy modifications. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium protocols have used same risk-stratified treatment for patients with and without DS. PROCEDURES: We compared clinical and outcome data of DS (n = 38) and non-DS (n = 1,248) patients enrolled on two consecutive DFCI ALL trials 00-001 (2000-2004) and 05-001 (2005-2011) with similar risk adapted therapy regardless of DS status. RESULTS: There was no difference in demographic or presenting clinical features between two groups except absence of T-cell phenotype and lower frequency of hyperdiploidy in DS-ALL group. All DS-ALL patients achieved complete remission; four relapsed and one subsequently died. There was no TRM in DS-ALL patients. DS-ALL patients had significantly higher rates of mucositis (52% vs. 12%, p < 0.001), non-CNS thrombosis (18% vs. 8%; p = 0.036), and seizure (16% vs. 5%, p = 0.010). Compared to non-DS-ALL patients, DS-ALL patients had a higher incidence of infections during all therapy phases. The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates of DS-ALL patients were similar to non-DS-ALL patients (91% [95% confidence interval (CI), 81-100] vs. 84% [95% CI, 82-86]; 97% [95% CI, 92-100] vs. 91% [95% CI, 90-93]). CONCLUSION: The low rates of relapse and TRM indicate that uniform risk-stratified therapy for DS-ALL and non-DS-ALL patients on DFCI ALL Consortium protocols was safe and effective, although the increased rate of toxicity in the DS-ALL patients highlights the importance of supportive care during therapy.","['Athale, Uma H', 'Puligandla, Maneka', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Asselin, Barbara', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Kelly, Kara M', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Welch, Jennifer J G', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Athale UH', 'Puligandla M', 'Stevenson KE', 'Asselin B', 'Clavell LA', 'Cole PD', 'Kelly KM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Leclerc JM', 'Michon B', 'Schorin MA', 'Sulis ML', 'Welch JJG', 'Harris MH', 'Neuberg DS', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center and School of Medicine, Rochester, NY, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, San Jorge Children's Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico."", 'Pediatrics, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Jacob's School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Buffalo, NY, USA."", 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles Bruneau Cancer Center, Sainte-Justine University Hospital, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles Bruneau Cancer Center, Sainte-Justine University Hospital, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Sainte-Foy, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatrics, Inova Fairfax Hospital for Children, Falls Church, VA, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA.', ""Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Hasbro Children's Hospital/Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180607,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Down Syndrome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Down syndrome', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*outcome', '*therapy', '*toxicity']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27256 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Oct;65(10):e27256. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27256.

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>/=1 x 10(9) /L; monocytes >/=10%), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in approximately 30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 ( approximately 60%), SRSF2 ( approximately 50%), ASXL1 ( approximately 40%) and the oncogenic RAS pathway ( approximately 30%) are frequent; while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact over-all survival. RISK STRATIFICATION: Molecularly integrated prognostic models include; the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM), Mayo Molecular Model (MMM), and the CMML specific prognostic model (CPSS-Mol). Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of nonsense or frameshift ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count > 10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 gm/dL, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into 4 groups; high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor), and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59, and 97 months, respectively. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of approximately 30%-40% and complete remission rates of approximately 7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.","['Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Patnaik MM', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2019/05/16 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.25104 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Jun;93(6):824-840. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25104.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",,PMC5995129,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6998-662X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821']","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['KL2 TR000136/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002379/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS957230'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RQ-PCR provides an accurate measure of the total leukemia cell mass and the degree to which bcr-abl transcripts are reduced by therapy correlates with progression free survival. AIM: We report molecular assessment of residual disease in CML Tunisian patients. METHODS: Between June 2003 and December 2014 we measured bcr-abl mRNA levels in peripheral blood from all Tunisian patients by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 708 patients with a mean age of 42 years were included in this study. Based on European Leukemia Net 2013, 80% of the patients achieved an optimal response 20% were in treatment failure. 38% of the patients achieved RM4 which corresponds to a bcr-abl/abl ratio <0.01%, 13% of the patients achieved RM4.5corresponding to bcr-abl/abl ratio of 0.0032%. CONCLUSION: CML patients had a good response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment. RQ-PCR is helpful in detecting any residual disease and determining the depth of the treatment response.","['Menif, Samia', 'Ben Youssef, Yosra', 'Bellaaj, Hatem', 'Ben Lakhal, Raihane', 'Laatiri, Adnen']","['Menif S', 'Ben Youssef Y', 'Bellaaj H', 'Ben Lakhal R', 'Laatiri A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Tunisia,Tunis Med,La Tunisie medicale,0413766,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tunisia', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['/article-medicale-tunisie.php?article=3314 [pii]'],ppublish,Tunis Med. 2017 Dec;95(12):229-231.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the possible role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in this process we analyzed the global and locus-specific genome-wide levels of 5hmC and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in human primary samples from 12 non-tumoral brains and 53 gliomas. We found that the levels of 5hmC identified in non-tumoral samples were significantly reduced in gliomas. Strikingly, hypo-hydroxymethylation at 4627 (9.3%) CpG sites was associated with aberrant DNA hypermethylation and was strongly enriched in CpG island shores. The DNA regions containing these CpG sites were enriched in H3K4me2 and presented a different genuine chromatin signature to that characteristic of the genes classically aberrantly hypermethylated in cancer. As this 5mC gain is inversely correlated with loss of 5hmC and has not been identified with classical sodium bisulfite-based technologies, we conclude that our data identifies a novel 5hmC-dependent type of aberrant DNA hypermethylation in glioma.","['Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Bayon, Gustavo F', 'Sierra, Marta I', 'Urdinguio, Rocio G', 'Torano, Estela G', 'Garcia, Maria G', 'Carella, Antonella', 'Lopez, Virginia', 'Santamarina, Pablo', 'Perez, Raul F', 'Belmonte, Thalia', 'Tejedor, Juan Ramon', 'Cobo, Isabel', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Mangas, Cristina', 'Ferrero, Cecilia', 'Rodrigo, Luis', 'Astudillo, Aurora', 'Ortea, Ignacio', 'Cueto Diaz, Sergio', 'Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Pablo', 'Garcia Alonso, J Ignacio', 'Mollejo, Manuela', 'Melendez, Barbara', 'Dominguez, Gemma', 'Bonilla, Felix', 'Fraga, Mario F']","['Fernandez AF', 'Bayon GF', 'Sierra MI', 'Urdinguio RG', 'Torano EG', 'Garcia MG', 'Carella A', 'Lopez V', 'Santamarina P', 'Perez RF', 'Belmonte T', 'Tejedor JR', 'Cobo I', 'Menendez P', 'Mangas C', 'Ferrero C', 'Rodrigo L', 'Astudillo A', 'Ortea I', 'Cueto Diaz S', 'Rodriguez-Gonzalez P', 'Garcia Alonso JI', 'Mollejo M', 'Melendez B', 'Dominguez G', 'Bonilla F', 'Fraga MF']","['Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology Research Center (CINN-CSIC), Universidad de Oviedo, Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Cancer CIBER-ONC, ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Institute of Oncology of Asturias (IUOPA), ISPA-HUCA.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, IMIBIC, Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research, Cordoba, Spain.', 'Mass Spectrometry Unit, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Physical and Analytical Chemistry, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Physical and Analytical Chemistry, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Avd.

However, DNMT3A variants are present in elderly healthy individuals and patients with AML in complete remission, which suggests that DNMT3A mutations may contribute to pre-leukemic clonal hematopoiesis. Although DNMT3A mutation has been thought to play a pivotal role in AML pathogenesis through the loss of DNA methylation functionality, other potential disease-related mechanisms are poorly understood. We identified that DNMT3A Arg882 mutation has two distinct mechanisms for developing clonal hematopoiesis and leukemia: (1) DNA methylation-dependent effect, which caused up-regulation of the anterior Hoxb cluster and many hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) -related genes, with hypo-methylation of the promoter-associated CpG island; and (2) DNA methylation-independent effect with enhanced recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that subsequently suppressed the expression of an array of differentiation-associated genes. Through these mechanisms, DNMT3A mutations were shown to inhibit the differentiation of HSCs and leukemic cells. These results identified PRC1 as a promising candidate for the development of therapeutic strategies in mutant DNMT3A-associated AML. Here, we review recent studies on AML with a focus on the clinical features and functional roles of DNMT3A mutations, and discuss future challenges to effectively cure DNMT3A mutation-associated hematopoietic disorders.","['Koya, Junji', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Koya J', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.', 'Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation, The University of Tokyo Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Clonal hematopoiesis', 'DNMT3A', 'Polycomb repressive complex']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.59.602 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2018;59(5):602-610. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.59.602.,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AZA is also believed to aid in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In randomized clinical trials for MDS, major and overall response rates for AZA alone were 16-33% and 38-60%, respectively. In the AZA-001 trial, the median overall survival (OS) for the AZA group was >24 months compared to 15 months for the control. However, other clinical trials have reported OS periods of 15-21 months, while population-based studies have reported OS rates much shorter than 20 months. Only a fraction of HR-MDS patients appears to benefit from AZA treatment. Furthermore, despite its low-intensity nature, the risk may outweigh the benefit in a significant proportion of patients; therefore, the indication of AZA should be reconsidered if good biomarkers that predict its efficacy are discovered. The response rate to AZA was moderately higher in MDS patients with TET2 mutations than in those without the mutations.

The survival rate of patients with AITL did not correlate with T-cell clonality, the presence of EBV-infected cells, EBV-DNA copy number, or IgH rearrangements. However, tumor-associated macrophage/M2 macrophages significantly correlated with worse overall survival (OS). Additionally, patients with composite lymphoma with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and AITL showed worse OS. We reported mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, IDH2, and RHOA. TET2 and DNMT3A mutations were identified in both programmed cell death 1 (PD1) + T cells and CD20+ cells. All RHOA and IDH2 mutations were confined to PD1+ T cells, whereas several mutations, including NOTCH1 mutations, were detected only in CD20+ cells. TET2 and DNMT3A mutations may originate in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) expresses CCR4 and FOXP3 of the regulatory T-cell marker. The p40tax viral protein leads to the transcriptional activation of several genes. In addition, the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor is considered important for T-cell proliferation and oncogenesis. The presence of Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes is inversely correlated with FOXP3 expression. M2 macrophages were associated with worse clinical prognosis in patients with ATLL. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression showed two patterns, namely neoplastic PD-L1 (nPD-L1) and microenvironmental PD-L1 (miPD-L1).

SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations show prominent specificity to the syndrome subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, respectively. These mutations are suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above mentioned syndromes most likely via abnormal RNA splicing. However, the precise mechanism and target genes have not been fully understood. Splicing alterations induced by these mutations are extensively studied using RNA sequencing. SF3B1 mutations caused misrecognition of 3' splice sites. Target genes included those involved in mitochondrial iron metabolism or heme biosynthesis, such as ABCB7 and PPOX, suggesting a role in the abnormal erythropoiesis associated with increased ring sideroblasts. By contrast, SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations were mainly associated with alternative exon usage in hundreds of genes. The targets included genes of which mutations are definitive or putative drivers in myeloid malignancies. Protein structure modeling and experiments with cell lines and mouse models supported these findings. ZRSR2 mutations were associated with the retention of U12-type introns, and this is consistent with the known role of ZRSR2 as an essential component of the U12-type spliceosome.

With no relapse of leukemia observed on bone marrow examination, secondary graft failure associated with autologous hematopoietic recovery was diagnosed. Bone marrow transplantation from the patient's HLA-haploidentical sister was performed because of graft failure on day 111 after the initial transplant using post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Neutrophil engraftment was achieved and complete donor chimera was obtained on days 14 and 21 after the second transplantation, respectively. With no serious complications or acute graft versus host disease, the patient was discharged with symptomatic improvement. According to our results, retransplant using PTCy obtained from an HLA-haploidentical sibling donor is a potential treatment for graft failure.","['Katayama, Oju', 'Honda, Shuhei', 'Yoshida, Natsumi', 'Nagamatsu, Kentaro', 'Takano, Kuniko', 'Kawano, Rie', 'Ogata, Masao', 'Shirao, Kuniaki']","['Katayama O', 'Honda S', 'Yoshida N', 'Nagamatsu K', 'Takano K', 'Kawano R', 'Ogata M', 'Shirao K']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita University Hospital.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Adult', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",['NOTNLM'],"['Graft failure', 'Haploidentical transplantation', 'Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)', 'Sibling donor']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.59.485 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2018;59(5):485-488. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.59.485.,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray analysis revealed miR-17-5p expression decreased sharply at 3, 7 and 14 days in the sciatic nerve conditioning injury group compared with the simple dorsal column lesion group. After miR-17-5p inhibition in DRG neurons, GAP-43 expression was upregulated and neurite growth was increased. STAT3 together with p-STAT3 showed opposite trends with miR-17-5p. MiR-17-5p inhibition extended neurite and upregulated STAT3, p-STAT3 and GAP-43. To further determine a substitution therapy for sciatic nerve conditioning injury, beta-phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), which downregulates miR-17-5p, was assessed. The results showed that treatment with 10 microM PEITC resulted in longest neurite length. Further experiments demonstrated PEITC induced neurite growth by inhibiting miR-17-5p and further upregulating STAT3, p-STAT3 and GAP-43. The somatosensory evoked potential test confirmed similar treatment effects for PEITC, Ad-miRNA-17-5p inhibitor, and sciatic nerve conditioning injury on the dorsal column lesion. In conclusion, the miR-17-5p/STAT3/GAP-43 axis is an indispensable component of sciatic nerve conditioning injury promoting repair of injured dorsal column. PEITC could promote repair of injured dorsal column via the miR-17-5p/STAT3/GAP-43 axis, and could mimic the treatment effect of sciatic nerve conditioning injury.","['Wang, Zhijie', 'Yuan, Wenqi', 'Li, Bo', 'Chen, Xueming', 'Zhang, Yanjun', 'Chen, Chuanjie', 'Yu, Mei', 'Xiu, Yucai', 'Li, Wenhua', 'Cao, Jiangang', 'Wang, Xin', 'Tao, Wen', 'Guo, Xiaoling', 'Feng, Shiqing', 'Wang, Tianyi']","['Wang Z', 'Yuan W', 'Li B', 'Chen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen C', 'Yu M', 'Xiu Y', 'Li W', 'Cao J', 'Wang X', 'Tao W', 'Guo X', 'Feng S', 'Wang T']","['a Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine , Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University , Chengde , Hebei Province , P.R.

Here, we analyzed the epigenome of two high-risk APL (hrAPL) patients and compared it to non-high-risk APL cases. Despite the lack of common genetic signatures, we found that human hrAPL blasts from patients with extremely poor prognosis display specific patterns of histone H3 acetylation, specifically hyperacetylation at a common set of enhancer regions. In addition, unique profiles of the repressive marks H3K27me3 and DNA methylation were exposed in high-risk APLs. Epigenetic comparison with low/intermediate-risk APLs and AMLs revealed hrAPL-specific patterns of histone acetylation and DNA methylation, suggesting these could be further developed into markers for clinical identification. The epigenetic drug MC2884, a newly generated general HAT/EZH2 inhibitor, induces apoptosis of high-risk APL blasts and reshapes their epigenomes by targeting both active and repressive marks. Together, our analysis uncovers distinctive epigenome signatures of hrAPL patients, and provides proof of concept for use of epigenome profiling coupled to epigenetic drugs to 'personalize' precision medicine.","['Singh, Abhishek A', 'Petraglia, Francesca', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Yi, Guoqiang', 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'Valente, Sergio', 'Mandoli, Amit', 'Scisciola, Lucia', 'Lindeboom, Rik', 'Kerstens, Hinri', 'Janssen-Megens, Eva M', 'Pourfarzad, Farzin', 'Habibi, Ehsan', 'Berentsen, Kim', 'Kim, Bowon', 'Logie, Colin', 'Heath, Simon', 'Wierenga, Albertus T J', 'Clarke, Laura', 'Flicek, Paul', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Kuijpers, Taco', 'Yaspo, Marie Laure', 'Valle, Veronique Della', 'Bernard, Olivier', 'Gut, Ivo', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Stunnenberg, Hendrik G', 'Mai, Antonello', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Martens, Joost H A']","['Singh AA', 'Petraglia F', 'Nebbioso A', 'Yi G', 'Conte M', 'Valente S', 'Mandoli A', 'Scisciola L', 'Lindeboom R', 'Kerstens H', 'Janssen-Megens EM', 'Pourfarzad F', 'Habibi E', 'Berentsen K', 'Kim B', 'Logie C', 'Heath S', 'Wierenga ATJ', 'Clarke L', 'Flicek P', 'Jansen JH', 'Kuijpers T', 'Yaspo ML', 'Valle VD', 'Bernard O', 'Gut I', 'Vellenga E', 'Stunnenberg HG', 'Mai A', 'Altucci L', 'Martens JHA']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Dipartimento di Biochimica Biofisica e Patologia Generale, Universita degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biochimica Biofisica e Patologia Generale, Universita degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'IRCCS SDN, Napoli Via E.

By screening of library compounds, we identified a novel hybrid epi-drug MC2884, a HAT/EZH2 inhibitor, able to induce bona fide cancer-selective cell death in both solid and hematological cancers in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo xenograft models. Anticancer action was due to an epigenome modulation by H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K9/14ac decrease, and to caspase-dependent apoptosis induction. MC2884 triggered mitochondrial pathway apoptosis by up-regulation of cleaved-BID, and strong down-regulation of BCL2. Even aggressive models of cancer, such as p53(-/-) or TET2(-/-) cells, responded to MC2884, suggesting MC2884 therapeutic potential also for the therapy of TP53 or TET2-deficient human cancers. MC2884 induced massive apoptosis in ex vivo human primary leukemia blasts with poor prognosis in vivo, by targeting BCL2 expression. MC2884-treatment reduced acetylation of the BCL2 promoter at higher level than combined p300 and EZH2 inhibition. This suggests a key role for BCL-2 reduction in potentiating responsiveness, also in combination therapy with BCL2 inhibitors. Finally, we identified both the mechanism of MC2884 action as well as a potential therapeutic scheme of its use. Altogether, this provides proof of concept for the use of epi-drugs coupled with epigenome analyses to 'personalize' precision medicine.","['Petraglia, Francesca', 'Singh, Abhishek A', 'Carafa,

While this definition categorizes the disease into a distinctive group, the large number of different genetic and epigenetic alterations actually suggests that AML is not a single disease, but a plethora of malignancies. Still, most AML patients are not treated with targeted medication but rather by uniform approaches such as chemotherapy. The identification of novel treatment options likely requires the identification of cancer cell vulnerabilities that take into account the different genetic and epigenetic make-up of the individual tumors. Here we show that STK3 depletion by knock-down, knock-out or chemical inhibition results in apoptotic cells death in some but not all AML cell lines and primary cells tested. This effect is mediated by a premature activation of cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) in presence of elevated cyclin B1 levels. The anti-leukemic effects seen in both bulk and progenitor AML cells suggests that STK3 might be a promising target in a subset of AML patients.","['Camgoz, Aylin', 'Paszkowski-Rogacz, Maciej', 'Satpathy, Shankha', 'Wermke, Martin', 'Hamann, Martin V', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Choudhary, Chunaram', 'Knapp, Stefan', 'Buchholz, Frank']","['Camgoz A', 'Paszkowski-Rogacz M', 'Satpathy S', 'Wermke M', 'Hamann MV', 'von Bonin M', 'Choudhary C', 'Knapp S', 'Buchholz F']","['Universitats KrebsCentrums Dresden, Medical Systems Biology, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Universitats KrebsCentrums Dresden, Medical Systems Biology, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Early Clinical Trial Unit, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Universitats KrebsCentrums Dresden, Medical Systems Biology, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Current address: Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) Partner Site, Dresden, Germany.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Universitats KrebsCentrums Dresden, Medical Systems Biology, Medical Faculty, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg and German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) Partner Site, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'STK3', 'UCN-01', 'mitosis', 'personalized medicine']",2018/06/08 06:00,2018/06/08 06:01,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25238 [doi]', '25238 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 22;9(39):25458-25473. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25238. eCollection 2018 May 22.,,,PMC5986655,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the developed countries, the treatment of this hematologic malignancy can cure almost 80% of children. In developing countries, few studies focus on acute leukemias in children. The results of cancer treatments in children are disappointing in most African countries, with a survival rate of 10-15%. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, biological, therapeutic and evolutionary features of ALL in children. Methods: we conducted a retrospective study of the medical records of children hospitalized for ALL between November 2009 and October 2011 in the pilot Paediatric Oncology Unit at the Charles de Gaulle University Pediatric Hospital Center, Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). All children treated according to the protocol of the Franco-African Pediatric Oncology Group 2005 (FAPOG) were included in the study. Results: in total, nine children with ALL were hospitalized during the two year study period. The average age of patients was 10.77+/- 2.82 years. They were predominantly male. The average time of hospitalization was 43.11 days +/- 39.54 days. The main symptoms were alteration of general state and fever. Nearly all the patients had tumor syndrome and bone marrow failure. Myelogram showed ALL type 1 in six of the nine patients. Eight patients underwent chemotherapy according the protocol of FAPOG 2005. Children's evolution was favorable in two patients who experienced remission, four patients had treatment failure. Six patients died. Conclusion: thanks to information campaigns, which will contribute to encourage early consultations, capacity-building measures for the medical staff allowing early diagnosis of ALL, the construction of a sufficiently equipped pediatric oncology center and a subsidy of anticancer drugs awarded by the state of Burkina Faso, the treatment of children with ALL would allow for better outcomes.","['Douamba, Sonia', 'Diallo, Fatimata', 'Nagalo, Kisito', 'Tamini, Laure', 'Dao, Lassina', 'Koueta, Fla', 'Ye, Diarra']","['Douamba S', 'Diallo F', 'Nagalo K', 'Tamini L', 'Dao L', 'Koueta F', 'Ye D']","['Service de la Pediatrie Medicale du CHU Pediatrique Charles de Gaulle de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Service de la Pediatrie Medicale du CHU Pediatrique Charles de Gaulle de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Service de la Pediatrie Medicale du CHU Pediatrique Charles de Gaulle de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Service de la Pediatrie Medicale du CHU Pediatrique Charles de Gaulle de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Service de la Pediatrie Medicale du CHU Pediatrique Charles de Gaulle de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'Service de la Pediatrie Medicale du CHU Pediatrique Charles de Gaulle de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.', 'UFR SDS Universite Ouaga I Pr Joseph Ki-Zerbo de Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],20180118,Uganda,Pan Afr Med J,The Pan African medical journal,101517926,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkina Faso', 'Child', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Franco-African pediatric oncology group', 'child']",2018/06/08 06:00,2018/06/14 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.11604/pamj.2018.29.44.11902 [doi]', 'PAMJ-29-44 [pii]']",epublish,Pan Afr Med J. 2018 Jan 18;29:44. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2018.29.44.11902. eCollection 2018.,,Les leucemies aigues lymphoblastiques de l'enfant a Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso): resultats de la prise en charge selon le protocole du Groupe Franco-Africain d'Oncologie Pediatrique 2005.,PMC5987115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that SETBP1 binds to gDNA in AT-rich promoter regions, causing activation of gene expression through recruitment of a HCF1/KMT2A/PHF8 epigenetic complex. Deletion of two AT-hooks abrogates the binding of SETBP1 to gDNA and impairs target gene upregulation. Genes controlled by SETBP1 such as MECOM are significantly upregulated in leukemias containing SETBP1 mutations. Gene ontology analysis of deregulated SETBP1 target genes indicates that they are also key controllers of visceral organ development and brain morphogenesis. In line with these findings, in utero brain electroporation of mutated SETBP1 causes impairment of mouse neurogenesis with a profound delay in neuronal migration. In summary, this work unveils a SETBP1 function that directly affects gene transcription and clarifies the mechanism operating in myeloid malignancies and in the Schinzel-Giedion syndrome caused by SETBP1 mutations.","['Piazza, Rocco', 'Magistroni, Vera', 'Redaelli, Sara', 'Mauri, Mario', 'Massimino, Luca', 'Sessa, Alessandro', 'Peronaci, Marco', 'Lalowski, Maciej', 'Soliymani, Rabah', 'Mezzatesta, Caterina', 'Pirola, Alessandra', 'Banfi, Federica', 'Rubio, Alicia', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Usala, Emilio', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Campiotti, Leonardo', 'Merli, Michele', 'Passamonti, Francesco', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Morotti, Alessandro', 'Pavesi, Francesca', 'Bregni, Marco', 'Broccoli, Vania', 'Baumann, Marc', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Piazza R', 'Magistroni V', 'Redaelli S', 'Mauri M', 'Massimino L', 'Sessa A', 'Peronaci M', 'Lalowski M', 'Soliymani R', 'Mezzatesta C', 'Pirola A', 'Banfi F', 'Rubio A', 'Rea D', 'Stagno F', 'Usala E', 'Martino B', 'Campiotti L', 'Merli M', 'Passamonti F', 'Onida F', 'Morotti A', 'Pavesi F', 'Bregni M', 'Broccoli V', 'Baumann M', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy. rocco.piazza@unimib.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Stem Cell and Neurogenesis Unit, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Meilahti Clinical Proteomics Core Facility, University of Helsinki, 00290, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Meilahti Clinical Proteomics Core Facility, University of Helsinki, 00290, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca and San Gerardo hospital, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Stem Cell and Neurogenesis Unit, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132, Milan, Italy.', 'Stem Cell and Neurogenesis Unit, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132, Milan, Italy.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010, Paris, France."", 'Chair and Hematology Section, Ferrarotto Hospital, AOU Policlinico, 95123, Catania, Italy.', 'Azienda Brotzu U.O.

However, such a conclusion is based on expression of an oncogenic version of Kras. Hence, we sought to determine the effect of simply increasing the amount of endogenous wild-type Kras on HSC fate. To this end, we utilized a codon-optimized version of the murine Kras gene (Krasex3op) that we developed, in which silent mutations in exon 3 render the encoded mRNA more efficiently translated, leading to increased protein expression without disruption to the normal gene architecture. We found that Kras protein levels were significantly increased in bone marrow (BM) HSCs in Krasex3op/ex3op mice, demonstrating that the translation of Kras in HSCs is normally constrained by rare codons. Krasex3op/ex3op mice displayed expansion of BM HSCs, progenitor cells, and B lymphocytes, but no evidence of myeloproliferative disease or leukemia in mice followed for 12 months. BM HSCs from Krasex3op/ex3op mice demonstrated increased multilineage repopulating capacity in primary competitive transplantation assays, but secondary competitive transplants revealed exhaustion of long-term HSCs. Following total body irradiation, Krasex3op/ex3op mice displayed accelerated hematologic recovery and increased survival. Mechanistically, HSCs from Krasex3op/ex3op mice demonstrated increased proliferation at baseline, with a corresponding increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (Cdk4/6) activation. Furthermore, both the enhanced colony-forming capacity and in vivo repopulating capacity of HSCs from Krasex3op/ex3op mice were dependent on Cdk4/6 activation. Finally, BM transplantation studies revealed that augmented Kras expression produced expansion of HSCs, progenitor cells, and B cells in a hematopoietic cell-autonomous manner, independent from effects on the BM microenvironment. This study provides fundamental demonstration of codon usage in a mammal having a biological consequence, which may speak to the importance of codon usage in mammalian biology.","['Sasine, Joshua P', 'Himburg, Heather A', 'Termini, Christina M', 'Roos, Martina', 'Tran, Evelyn', 'Zhao, Liman', 'Kan, Jenny', 'Li, Michelle', 'Zhang, Yurun', 'de Barros, Stephanie C', 'Rao, Dinesh S', 'Counter, Christopher M', 'Chute, John P']","['Sasine JP', 'Himburg HA', 'Termini CM', 'Roos M', 'Tran E', 'Zhao L', 'Kan J', 'Li M', 'Zhang Y', 'de Barros SC', 'Rao DS', 'Counter CM', 'Chute JP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Physiology.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Stem Cell Research, and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Stem Cell Research, and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Stem Cell Research, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, North California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Stem Cell Research, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180607,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Codon/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Animal', 'Mutation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*Stem cells']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2017/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['98197 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.98197 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 Jun 7;3(11). pii: 98197. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.98197. eCollection 2018 Jun 7.,"['0 (Codon)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,PMC6124423,,,"['P01 CA203657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA094184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inactivation in mice confers resistance to a range of tumor models by disrupting immunosuppression mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs). The PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib has proven highly effective in the clinical treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the potential to extend the use of PI3Kdelta inhibitors to nonhematological cancers is being evaluated. In this work, we demonstrate that the antitumor effect of PI3Kdelta inactivation is primarily mediated through the disruption of Treg function, and correlates with tumor dependence on Treg immunosuppression. Compared with Treg-specific PI3Kdelta deletion, systemic PI3Kdelta inactivation is less effective at conferring resistance to tumors. We show that PI3Kdelta deficiency impairs the maturation and reduces the capacity of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to kill tumor cells in vitro, and to respond to tumor antigen-specific immunization in vivo. PI3Kdelta inactivation antagonized the antitumor effects of tumor vaccines and checkpoint blockade therapies intended to boost the CD8+ T cell response. These findings provide insights into mechanisms by which PI3Kdelta inhibition promotes antitumor immunity and demonstrate that the mechanism is distinct from that mediated by immune checkpoint blockade.","['Lim, Ee Lyn', 'Cugliandolo, Fiorella M', 'Rosner, Dalya R', 'Gyori, David', 'Roychoudhuri, Rahul', 'Okkenhaug, Klaus']","['Lim EL', 'Cugliandolo FM', 'Rosner DR', 'Gyori D', 'Roychoudhuri R', 'Okkenhaug K']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180607,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/transplantation', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Costimulatory and Inhibitory T-Cell Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Diphtheria Toxin/administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/immunology/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adaptive immunity', '*Cancer immunotherapy', '*Immunology', '*Oncology', '*Signal transduction']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['120626 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.120626 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 Jun 7;3(11). pii: 120626. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.120626. eCollection 2018 Jun 7.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Costimulatory and Inhibitory T-Cell Receptors)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Pik3cd protein, mouse)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",,PMC6124416,,,"['095198/Z/10/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/000C0409/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', '095691/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/000C0427/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research', 'Council/United Kingdom', '105663/Z/14/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB/N007794/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/000C0428/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research', 'Council/United Kingdom', 'BBS/E/B/000C0407/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/E009867/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LASV entry into a variety of cell types is mediated by interactions with glycosyltransferase LARGE-modified O-linked glycans present on the ubiquitous receptor alpha-dystroglycan (alphaDG). However, cells lacking alphaDG are permissive to LASV infection, suggesting that alternative receptors exist. Previous studies demonstrated that the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-binding receptors Axl and Tyro3 along with C-type lectin receptors mediate alphaDG-independent entry. Here, we demonstrate that another PtdSer receptor, TIM-1, mediates LASV glycoprotein (GP)-pseudotyped virion entry into alphaDG-knocked-out HEK 293T and wild-type (WT) Vero cells, which express alphaDG lacking appropriate glycosylation. To investigate the mechanism by which TIM-1 mediates enhancement of entry, we demonstrate that mutagenesis of the TIM-1 IgV domain PtdSer-binding pocket abrogated transduction. Furthermore, the human TIM-1 IgV domain-binding monoclonal antibody ARD5 blocked transduction of pseudovirions bearing LASV GP in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, as we showed previously for other viruses that use TIM-1 for entry, a chimeric TIM-1 protein that substitutes the proline-rich region (PRR) from murine leukemia virus envelope (Env) for the mucin-like domain served as a competent receptor. These studies provide evidence that, in the absence of a functional alphaDG, TIM-1 mediates the entry of LASV pseudoviral particles through interactions of virions with the IgV PtdSer-binding pocket of TIM-1.IMPORTANCE PtdSer receptors, such as TIM-1, are emerging as critical entry factors for many enveloped viruses. Most recently, hepatitis C virus and Zika virus have been added to a growing list. PtdSer receptors engage with enveloped viruses through the binding of PtdSer embedded in the viral envelope, defining them as GP-independent receptors. This GP-independent entry mechanism should effectively mediate the entry of all enveloped viruses, yet LASV GP-pseudotyped viruses were previously found to be unresponsive to PtdSer receptor enhancement in HEK 293T cells. Here, we demonstrate that LASV pseudovirions can utilize the PtdSer receptor TIM-1 but only in the absence of appropriately glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan (alphaDG), the high-affinity cell surface receptor for LASV. Our studies shed light on LASV receptor utilization and explain why previous studies performed with alpha-DG-expressing cells did not find that LASV pseudovirions utilize PtdSer receptors for virus uptake.","['Brouillette, Rachel B', 'Phillips, Elisabeth K', 'Patel, Radhika', 'Mahauad-Fernandez, Wadie', 'Moller-Tank, Sven', 'Rogers, Kai J', 'Dillard, Jacob A', 'Cooney, Ashley L', 'Martinez-Sobrido, Luis', 'Okeoma, Chioma', 'Maury, Wendy']","['Brouillette RB', 'Phillips EK', 'Patel R', 'Mahauad-Fernandez W', 'Moller-Tank S', 'Rogers KJ', 'Dillard JA', 'Cooney AL', 'Martinez-Sobrido L', 'Okeoma C', 'Maury W']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA wendy-maury@uiowa.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180731,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dystroglycans/*deficiency', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Lassa virus/*physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vero Cells', '*Virus Internalization']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Lassa virus', '*TIM-1', '*arenavirus', '*phosphatidylserine', '*phosphatidylserine receptor', '*receptor', '*viral lipids', '*virus entry']",2018/06/08 06:00,2018/08/18 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00093-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00093-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jul 31;92(16). pii: JVI.00093-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00093-18.

Patients (N = 76) were randomly assigned to 30- or 60-mg/day doses (escalations to 60 or 90 mg/day, respectively, permitted for lack/loss of response) of single-agent oral quizartinib dihydrochloride. Allelic frequency of at least 10% was defined as FLT3-ITD-mutated disease. Coprimary endpoints were composite complete remission (CRc) rates and incidence of QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of more than 480 ms (grade 2 or greater). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), duration of CRc, bridge to transplant, and safety. CRc rates were 47% in both groups, similar to earlier reports with higher quizartinib doses. Incidence of QTcF above 480 ms was 11% and 17%, and QTcF above 500 ms was 5% and 3% in the 30- and 60-mg groups, respectively, which is less than earlier reports with higher doses of quizartinib. Median OS (20.9 and 27.3 weeks), duration of CRc (4.2 and 9.1 weeks), and bridge to transplant rates (32% and 42%) were higher in the 60-mg groups than in the 30-mg group. Dose escalation occurred in 61% and 14% of patients in the 30- and 60-mg groups, respectively. This high clinical activity of quizartinib at the evaluated doses is consistent with previous reports with an improved safety profile. Need to dose-escalate more than half of patients who received quizartinib 30 mg also supports further investigation of treatment with quizartinib 60 mg/day.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Schiller, Gary J', 'Trone, Denise', 'Gammon, Guy', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Levis, Mark J']","['Cortes JE', 'Tallman MS', 'Schiller GJ', 'Trone D', 'Gammon G', 'Goldberg SL', 'Perl AE', 'Marie JP', 'Martinelli G', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Levis MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Pharma Development, San Diego, CA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Pharma Development, San Diego, CA.', 'Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Saint-Antoine Hospital, AH-HP-University Paris 6, Paris, France.', 'University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180606,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Gene Duplication', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2018/06/08 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32004-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-01-821629 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Aug 9;132(6):598-607. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-01-821629.

Transferrin receptor 1 (CD71) is a trans-membrane glycoprotein which has important role in iron homeostasis by acting as a gatekeeper regulating iron uptake from transferrin and is an attractive target for anti-cancer agents, particularly those that aim to induce lethal iron deprivation in malignant hematopoietic cells. AIM OF THE WORK: To assess the prognostic value of Transferrin receptor -1 (CD71) in children with newly diagnosed ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 75 patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Transferrin receptor-1 expression was analyzed on the bone marrow blasts by flow cytometry at time of diagnosis with positive CD71 expression is considered when >/=20% of malignant cells express this marker while negative expression is considered when <20% of malignant cells express this marker. RESULTS: Transferrin receptor-1 positive expression was detected in 45 patients (60%) while negative expression was found in the remaining 30 patients (40%). CD71 expression was significantly higher on T- ALL patients compared with B-ALL patients.

Unfortunately, these developments have led to the onset of resistances with regards to the new treatments. This is particularly true if we face with the therapeutic field of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). This review gives an overview of possible TKI resistances that can occur during the treatment of an oncologic diesease and available strategies that can be adopted, taking cues from a successful example such as CML. METHODS: We performed a literature search for peer-reviewed articles using different databases, such as PubMed and Scopus, and exploiting different keywords and different logical operators. RESULTS: 68 papers were included in the review. Twenty-four papers give an overview of the causes of TKIs resistances in the wide oncologic field. The remaining papers deal CML, deeply analysing the TKIs Resistances present in this pathology and the strategies adopted to overcome them. CONCLUSION: The aim of this review is to furnish an overview and a methodological guideline for the approach and the overcoming of TKIs Resistances.","['Zanforlin, Enrico', 'Zagotto, Giuseppe', 'Ribaudo, Giovanni']","['Zanforlin E', 'Zagotto G', 'Ribaudo G']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'Cancer', 'TKI', 'asciminib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'kinase', 'resistance.']",2018/06/08 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-90968 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867325666180607092451 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2019;26(33):6033-6052. doi: 10.2174/0929867325666180607092451.,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (protein phosphatase methylesterase-1)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through inhibition of let-7 biogenesis, LIN28 functions as a pluripotency factor, as well as a driver of tumorigenesis. Here, we report a fluorescence polarization assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors for both domains of LIN28 involved in let-7 interactions. Of 101,017 compounds screened, six inhibit LIN28:let-7 binding and impair LIN28-mediated let-7 oligouridylation. Upon further characterization, we demonstrate that the LIN28 inhibitor TPEN destabilizes the zinc-knuckle domain of LIN28, while LI71 binds the cold shock domain to suppress LIN28's activity against let-7 in leukemia cells and embryonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate selective pharmacologic inhibition of individual domains of LIN28 and provide a foundation for therapeutic inhibition of the let-7 biogenesis pathway in LIN28-driven diseases.","['Wang, Longfei', 'Rowe, R Grant', 'Jaimes, Adriana', 'Yu, Chunxiao', 'Nam, Yunsun', 'Pearson, Daniel S', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Xie, Xiangyu', 'Marion, William', 'Heffron, Gregory J', 'Daley, George Q', 'Sliz, Piotr']","['Wang L', 'Rowe RG', 'Jaimes A', 'Yu C', 'Nam Y', 'Pearson DS', 'Zhang J', 'Xie X', 'Marion W', 'Heffron GJ', 'Daley GQ', 'Sliz P']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Stem Cell Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

We discuss the patterns and prevalence of neurocognitive problems commonly experienced by survivors of CNS tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the two most commonly researched cancer diagnoses. Research documenting the direct effects of tumor location and treatment type and intensity is presented, and patient characteristics that moderate outcomes (eg, age at diagnosis and sex) are discussed. Potential biologic mechanisms of neurotoxic treatment exposures, such as cranial irradiation and intrathecal and high-dose antimetabolite chemotherapy, are reviewed. Genetic, brain imaging, and neurochemical biomarkers of neurocognitive impairment are discussed. Long-term survivors of childhood cancer are also at risk for physical morbidity (eg, cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine) and problems with health behaviors (eg, sleep); research is reviewed that demonstrates these health problems contribute to neurocognitive impairment in survivors with or without exposure to neurotoxic therapies. We conclude this review with a discussion of literature supporting specific interventions that may be beneficial in the treatment of survivors who already experience neurocognitive impairment, as well as in the prevention of impairment manifestation.","['Krull, Kevin R', 'Hardy, Kristina K', 'Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Schuitema, Ilse', 'Kesler, Shelli R']","['Krull KR', 'Hardy KK', 'Kahalley LS', 'Schuitema I', 'Kesler SR']","[""Kevin R.

This review summarizes recent literature on SMN epidemiology, risk factors, surveillance, and interventions. Survivors of childhood cancer experience long-term increased SMN risk compared with the general population, with a greater than twofold increased solid tumor risk extending beyond age 40 years. There is a dose-dependent increased risk for solid tumors after radiotherapy, with the highest risks for tumors occurring in or near the treatment field (eg, greater than fivefold increased risk for breast, brain, thyroid, skin, bone, and soft tissue malignancies). Alkylating and anthracycline chemotherapies increase the risk for development of several solid malignancies in addition to acute leukemia/myelodysplasia, and these risks may be modified by other patient characteristics, such as age at exposure and, potentially, inherited genetic susceptibility. Strategies for identifying survivors at risk and initiating long-term surveillance have improved and interventions are underway to improve knowledge about late-treatment effects among survivors and caregivers. Better understanding of treatment-related risk factors and genetic susceptibility holds promise for refining surveillance strategies and, ultimately, upfront cancer therapies.","['Turcotte, Lucie M', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Reulen, Raoul C', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Hodgson, David C', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Henderson, Tara O']","['Turcotte LM', 'Neglia JP', 'Reulen RC', 'Ronckers CM', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Morton LM', 'Hodgson DC', 'Yasui Y', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Henderson TO']","[""Lucie M.

It is primarily used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. It is also used in the treatment of other forms of cancer Hodgkin disease, lymphosarcoma, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, reticulosarcoma and melanosarcoma (Lopes et al. Crit Rev Biotechnol 23:1-18, 2015). It deaminates l-asparagine present in the plasma pool causing the demise of tumor cell due to nutritional starvation. The anti-tumorigenic property of this enzyme has been exploited for over four decades and evidenced as a boon for the cancer patients.

The recurrence of infection and its associated morbidity and mortality are due to multiple risk factors. Diarrhea is common in HSCT recipients, but the diagnosis of diarrhea caused by CDI is a therapeutic challenge due to frequent Clostridium difficile colonization with diarrhea secondary to non-infectious causes. The high recurrence rate is a significant challenge in the treatment of immunocompromised patients. Close monitoring of the patients, timely diagnosis, preventive measures, treatment with antibiotics, and the removal of offending agents can help in the management and cure of the disease.

While upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulceroproliferative growth in the body of the stomach, its biopsy revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer developing in a patient with CLL may be due to the immunological impairment associated with other etiological factors, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, etc. The treatment of gastric cancer consists of a gastrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The co-existence of CLL and carcinoma stomach can pose a challenge in the management of such patients.","['Mangal, Mayank', 'Sudharsanan, Sundaramurthi', 'Elamurugan, T P', 'Jagdish, Sadasivan']","['Mangal M', 'Sudharsanan S', 'Elamurugan TP', 'Jagdish S']","['Surgery, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, IND.', 'Surgery, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, IND.', 'Surgery, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, IND.', 'Surgery, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, IND.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180402,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,['NOTNLM'],"['adenocarcinoma', 'cll', 'stomach']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.2405 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2018 Apr 2;10(4):e2405. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2405.,,,PMC5984260,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HMGB1 levels are elevated during acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) progression followed by participation of this protein in triggering signalling events in target cells as a pro-inflammatory stimulus. This mechanism was hypothesised to be employed as a survival pathway by malignant blood cells and our aims were therefore to test this hypothesis experimentally. Here we report that HMGB1 triggers the release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by primary human AML cells. TNF-alpha induces interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) production by healthy leukocytes, leading to IL-1beta-induced secretion of stem cell factor (SCF) by competent cells (for example endothelial cells). These results were verified in mouse bone marrow and primary human AML blood plasma samples. In addition, HMGB1 was found to induce secretion of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and this process was dependent on the immune receptor Tim-3. We therefore conclude that HMGB1 is critical for AML progression as a ligand of Tim-3 and other immune receptors thus supporting survival/proliferation of AML cells and possibly the process of angiogenesis.","['Yasinska, Inna M', 'Goncalves Silva, Isabel', 'Sakhnevych, Svetlana S', 'Ruegg, Laura', 'Hussain, Rohanah', 'Siligardi, Giuliano', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Bardelli, Marco', 'Varani, Luca', 'Raap, Ulrike', 'Berger, Steffen', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Fasler-Kan, Elizaveta', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Yasinska IM', 'Goncalves Silva I', 'Sakhnevych SS', 'Ruegg L', 'Hussain R', 'Siligardi G', 'Fiedler W', 'Wellbrock J', 'Bardelli M', 'Varani L', 'Raap U', 'Berger S', 'Gibbs BF', 'Fasler-Kan E', 'Sumbayev VV']","['Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Beamline 23, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK.', 'Beamline 23, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.', ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland."", 'Department of Medicine (Dermatology and Allergology), University of Oldenburg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery and Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Switzerland."", 'Department of Medicine (Dermatology and Allergology), University of Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery and Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Switzerland."", 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180227,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukaemia', '*Tim-3', '*high mobility group box 1', '*inflammation', '*stem cell factor']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1438109 [doi]', '1438109 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Feb 27;7(6):e1438109. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1438109. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5980411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T cell subpopulations of both MBL and early stage CLL harbored restricted TRB gene repertoire, with CD4(+) T cell clonal expansions whose frequency followed the numerical increase of clonal B cells. Longitudinal analysis in MBL cases revealed clonal persistence, alluding to persistent antigen stimulation. In addition, the identification of shared clonotypes among different MBL/early stage CLL cases pointed towards selection of the T cell clones by common antigenic elements. T cell clonotypes previously described in viral infections and immune disorders were also detected.

Many of these compounds derived from natural sources exhibit specific physiologic or biochemical effects. An example of a natural product is chitosan, which is enriched in the shells of certain seafood that are frequently consumed worldwide. Like other natural products, chitosan has the potential for applications in clinical medicine and perhaps in cancer therapy. Toward this end, the immunomodulatory or anti-cancer properties of chitosan have yet to be reported. In this study, we discovered that chitosan enhanced the anti-tumor activity of natural killer (NK) cells by activating dendritic cells (DCs). In the presence of DCs, chitosan augmented IFN-gamma production by human NK cells. Mechanistically, chitosan activated DCs to express pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15, which in turn activated the STAT4 and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, respectively, in NK cells. Moreover, chitosan promoted NK cell survival, and also enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity against leukemia cells. Finally, a related in vivo study demonstrated that chitosan activated NK cells against B16F10 tumor cells in an immunocompetent syngeneic murine melanoma model. This effect was accompanied by in vivo upregulation of IL-12 and IL-15 in DCs, as well as increased IFN-gamma production and cytolytic degranulation in NK cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that chitosan activates DCs leading to enhanced capacity for immune surveillance by NK cells. We believe that our study has future clinical applications for chitosan in the prevention or treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.","['Li, Xinxin', 'Dong, Wenjuan', 'Nalin, Ansel P', 'Wang, Yufeng', 'Pan, Pan', 'Xu, Bo', 'Zhang, Yibo', 'Tun, Steven', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Wang, Li-Shu', 'He, Xiaoming', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Yu, Jianhua']","['Li X', 'Dong W', 'Nalin AP', 'Wang Y', 'Pan P', 'Xu B', 'Zhang Y', 'Tun S', 'Zhang J', 'Wang LS', 'He X', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Yu J']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Department of Bioinformatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180313,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chitosan', '*IFN-gamma', '*anti-tumor', '*dendritic cells', '*natural killer cells']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1431085 [doi]', '1431085 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Mar 13;7(6):e1431085. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1431085. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5980345,,,"['R01 AI129582/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA185301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS106170/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA163205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the oldest antibodies, which is widely used for the treatment of lymphomas and autoimmune diseases, is the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. In recent years, new antibodies against CD20 have been developed including ofatumumab and obinutuzumab. An important mechanism of action of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is activation of immune cells via Fc receptors (FcgammaRs). However, surprisingly, little is known about triggering of FcgammaRs by different therapeutic antibodies in general and anti-CD20 antibodies in particular. Here we establish a reporter assay to assess whether a particular antibody activates a certain Fc receptor. Using this assay we corroborated previous reports demonstrating obinutuzumab's ability to highly activate FcgammaRIIIa (CD16a). Importantly, we discovered that obinutuzumab also activates FcgammaRI (CD64) significantly more than rituximab and ofatumumab in response to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells obtained from patients. Mechanistically we show that this is due to the lack of FcgammaRIIb-mediated internalization of obinutuzumab following binding to CD20. Moreover, we show that obinutuzumab induces increased phagocytosis by primary macrophages in an FcgammaRI-dependent manner. Beyond the discovery of a new mechanism of obinutuzumab activity, the reporter assay can be applied to other therapeutic antibodies and may assist in developing antibodies with improved immunological properties.","['Elias, Shlomo', 'Kahlon, Shira', 'Kotzur, Rebecca', 'Kaynan, Noah', 'Mandelboim, Ofer']","['Elias S', 'Kahlon S', 'Kotzur R', 'Kaynan N', 'Mandelboim O']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah - Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Department of Immunology and Cancer Research, Institute for Medical Research Israel Canada (IMRIC), Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Department of Immunology and Cancer Research, Institute for Medical Research Israel Canada (IMRIC), Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Immunogenetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Department of Immunology and Cancer Research, Institute for Medical Research Israel Canada (IMRIC), Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, Department of Immunology and Cancer Research, Institute for Medical Research Israel Canada (IMRIC), Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180212,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*Fc receptors', '*anti-CD20', '*obinutuzumab', '*rituximab']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1428158 [doi]', '1428158 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Feb 12;7(6):e1428158. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1428158. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5980409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intestinal trichomonads have been reported as causative agents of diarrhea in cats. While Pentatrichomonas hominis is considered commensal, Tritrichomonas foetus has been found to cause feline large bowel diarrhea in cats. In our report, two young cats infected with the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and presenting with chronic diarrhea were identified as having trichomonads in their feces, based on direct examination and fecal culture. Molecular assays (PCR and DNA sequencing) revealed that the parasite involved was P hominis, not T foetus, as was suspected. The animals had already been subjected to ineffective therapy with metronidazole, and after the use of ronidazole, their feces became dry and formed. Relevance and novel information: This case report describes P hominis infection as a possible cause of chronic diarrhea in two young cats also infected by FeLV. The parasite was probably resistant to metronidazole, the drug of choice in the literature, and sensitive to ronidazole. Although considered commensal, P hominis infection should be evaluated as a differential diagnosis in cats with chronic diarrhea, especially those that are immunocompromised. Moreover, a combination of techniques such as direct examination and/or fecal culture and PCR is essential for an accurate diagnosis of P hominis infection.","['Bastos, Bethania Ferreira', 'Brener, Beatriz', 'de Figueiredo, Mariana Alves', 'Leles, Daniela', 'Mendes-de-Almeida, Flavya']","['Bastos BF', 'Brener B', 'de Figueiredo MA', 'Leles D', 'Mendes-de-Almeida F']","['Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180530,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,,2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116918774959 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116918774959 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2018 May 30;4(1):2055116918774959. doi: 10.1177/2055116918774959. eCollection 2018 Jan-Jun.,,,PMC5977435,,,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is B-cell malignancy that also expresses ROR1. In this study, we found that the plasma of patients with MCL had high levels of Wnt5a, a ROR1 ligand, that were comparable to those found in patients with CLL; in contrast Wnt5a was virtually undetectable in the plasma of age-matched healthy adults. We also found that Wnt5a induced Rac1 activation in the primary MCL cells. Cirmtuzumab, but not ibrutinib, could inhibit the capacity of Wnt5a to induce primary MCL cells to activate Rac1. Addition of exogenous Wnt5a in vitro significantly enhanced the numbers of MCL cell divisions and the proportion of dividing MCL cells entering S/G2 in MCL cells over time in the presence of CD154 and IL-4/10. Treatment of the MCL cells with cirmtuzumab, but not ibrutinib, blocked Wnt5a-enhanced proliferation of MCL cells.

For chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), these supportive monocyte/macrophages are known as nurse-like cells (NLCs), although the potential effectiveness of selective small-molecule inhibitors of CSF1R against CLL is understudied. Here, we demonstrate the preclinical activity of two inhibitors of CSF1R, GW-2580 and ARRY-382, in primary CLL patient samples. We observed at least 25% of CLL samples showed sub-micromolar sensitivity to CSF1R inhibitors. This sensitivity was observed in samples with varying genetic and clinical backgrounds, although higher white cell count and monocyte cell percentage was associated with increased sensitivity. Depleting CD14-expressing monocytes preferentially decreased viability in samples sensitive to CSF1R inhibitors, and treating samples with CSF1R inhibitors eliminated the presence of NLCs in long-term culture conditions. These results indicate that CSF1R small-molecule inhibitors target CD14-expressing monocytes in the CLL microenvironment, thereby depriving leukemia cells of extrinsic support signals. In addition, significant synergy was observed combining CSF1R inhibitors with idelalisib or ibrutinib, two current CLL therapies that disrupt tumor cell intrinsic B-cell receptor signaling. These findings support the concept of simultaneously targeting supportive NLCs and CLL cells and demonstrate the potential clinical utility of this combination.","['Edwards V, David K', 'Sweeney, David Tyler', 'Ho, Hibery', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Rofelty, Angela', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Liu, Selina Qiuying', 'Danilov, Alexey V', 'Lee, Patrice', 'Chantry, David', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Spurgeon, Stephen E', 'Loriaux, Marc M']","['Edwards V DK', 'Sweeney DT', 'Ho H', 'Eide CA', 'Rofelty A', 'Agarwal A', 'Liu SQ', 'Danilov AV', 'Lee P', 'Chantry D', 'McWeeney SK', 'Druker BJ', 'Tyner JW', 'Spurgeon SE', 'Loriaux MM']","['Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Array BioPharma, Boulder, CO, USA.', 'Array BioPharma, Boulder, CO, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180515,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor', 'small-molecule inhibitors', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-associated macrophages']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25191 [doi]', '25191 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 15;9(37):24576-24589. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25191. eCollection 2018 May 15.,,,PMC5973855,,,"['R00 CA151457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST J.W.T. receives research support from Agios', 'Pharmaceuticals, Array Biopharma, Aptose Biosciences, AstraZeneca, Constellation', 'Pharmaceuticals, Genentech, Incyte, Janssen Research & Development, Seattle', 'Genetics, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and is a consultant for Leap Oncology.', 'S.E.S. receives research support from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Genentech, Janssen,', 'Gilead, and Acerta and has received an honorarium from Gilead.

Limited knowledge regarding GPCR expression in cancer cells likely has contributed to this lack of use of GPCR-targeted drugs as cancer therapeutics. We thus undertook GPCRomic studies to define the expression of endoGPCRs (which respond to endogenous molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters and metabolites) in multiple types of cancer cells. Using TaqMan qPCR arrays to quantify the mRNA expression of approximately 340 such GPCRs, we found that human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells/stromal cells associated with CLL, breast cancer cell lines, colon cancer cell lines, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and PDAC tumors express 50 to >100 GPCRs, including many orphan GPCRs (which lack known physiologic agonists). Limited prior data exist regarding the expression or function of most of the highly expressed GPCRs in these cancer cells and tumors. Independent results from public cancer gene expression databases confirm the expression of such GPCRs. We propose that highly expressed GPCRs in cancer cells (for example, GPRC5A in PDAC and colon cancer cells and GPR68 in PDAC CAFs) may contribute to the malignant phenotype, serve as biomarkers and/or may be novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer.","['Insel, Paul A', 'Sriram, Krishna', 'Wiley, Shu Z', 'Wilderman, Andrea', 'Katakia, Trishna', 'McCann, Thalia', 'Yokouchi, Hiroshi', 'Zhang, Lingzhi', 'Corriden, Ross', 'Liu, Dongling', 'Feigin, Michael E', 'French, Randall P', 'Lowy, Andrew M', 'Murray, Fiona']","['Insel PA', 'Sriram K', 'Wiley SZ', 'Wilderman A', 'Katakia T', 'McCann T', 'Yokouchi H', 'Zhang L', 'Corriden R', 'Liu D', 'Feigin ME', 'French RP', 'Lowy AM', 'Murray F']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, United States.', 'Department of Surgery, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Surgery, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GPCR array', 'breast cancer', 'cancer microenvironment', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'colon cancer', 'orphan receptors', 'pancreatic cancer']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.00431 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 May 22;9:431. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00431. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5972277,,,"['R01 CA155620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA189477/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA121938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study were to quantify the lifetime risks, life expectancies (LEs) after diagnosis, expected years of life lost (EYLL), and lifetime health care expenditures for 19 major cancers in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 831,314 patients with 19 pathologically proven cancers were abstracted from the Taiwan Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2012. They were linked to the National Mortality Registry (1998-2014) and National Health Insurance reimbursement database (1998-2013) for survival and health care costs. We estimated the cumulative incidence rate for ages 0-79 years and the lifetime survival function for patients with different cancer sites. The EYLL was calculated by subtracting the LE of each cancer cohort from that of the age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national life tables. The estimated lifetime cost was calculated by adding up the product of survival probability and mean cost at the corresponding duration-to-date after adjustment for the inflation to the year of 2013. Results: There were 5 cancers with a lifetime risk exceeding 4%: colorectal, liver, lung, and prostate in males, and breast and colorectal in females. Cancers with EYLL of >10 years were: esophageal, intrahepatic bile ducts, liver, pancreas, oral, nasopharyngeal, leukemia, lung, and gallbladder, extrahepatic bile ducts and biliary tract in males, and intrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, nasopharyngeal, lung, esophageal, leukemia, liver, gallbladder, extrahepatic bile ducts and biliary tract, ovary, and stomach in females. Cancers with lifetime health care expenditures exceeding US$50,000 to the National Health Insurance were as follows: leukemia, kidney, testis, renal pelvis and ureter in males, and renal pelvis and ureter, leukemia, breast, urinary bladder, kidney, ovary, and nasopharyngeal in females. All these impacts should be considered in health policy decisions. Conclusion: The impacts of cancer in Taiwan are very large. Future studies must consider both quality of life and the entire impact from societal perspectives.","['Wu, Tzu-Yi', 'Chung, Chia-Hua', 'Lin, Chia-Ni', 'Hwang, Jing-Shiang', 'Wang, Jung-Der']","['Wu TY', 'Chung CH', 'Lin CN', 'Hwang JS', 'Wang JD']","['Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180525,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer prevention', 'expected years of life lost', 'health impacts', 'incidence rate']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S155601 [doi]', 'clep-10-581 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2018 May 25;10:581-591. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S155601. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5973634,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of miRNAs might modulate the resistance of cancer cells to anticancer drugs; yet, the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we showed a significant downregulation of miR-134 in human multidrug-resistant leukemia cells and relapsed/refractory AML patient samples. Overexpression of miR-134 sensitized K562/A02 and HL-60/ADM cells to Ara-C, inhibited cell colony formation, and enhanced the ability of Ara-C to induce apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Mnks was a putative target of miR-134, which was inversely correlated with miR-134 expression in human multidrug-resistant leukemia cells and relapsed/refractory AML patient samples. Further investigation showed that miR-134 increased the anti-tumor effects of Ara-C through inhibiting phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and downregulating Mcl-1 and bcl2, which was independent of p38 and Erk1/2 activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-134 plays a pivotal role in AML Ara-C resistance through increasing cell sensitivity to Ara-C and promoting apoptosis by targeting Mnks.","['Chen, Kankan', 'Chen, Yue', 'Chen, Zhi', 'Shi, Yuye', 'He, Zhengmei', 'Ding, Banghe', 'Wang, Chunling', 'Yu, Liang']","['Chen K', 'Chen Y', 'Chen Z', 'Shi Y', 'He Z', 'Ding B', 'Wang C', 'Yu L']","[""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Huaian No 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, Jiangsu, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180525,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mnks', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'eIF4E', 'miR-134']",2018/06/07 06:00,2018/06/07 06:01,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S143465 [doi]', 'ott-11-3141 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 May 25;11:3141-3147. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S143465. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5975600,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One mutation hotspot, at amino acid threonine 676 (Thr676), was found in 27% of AML patients with NF1 mutations.

Retrovirus reverse transcription creates numerous potential ligands for cytosolic host sensors that recognize foreign nucleic acids, including single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), RNA/DNA hybrids, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We and others recently showed that the sensors cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41), and members of the Aim2-like receptor (ALR) family participate in the recognition of retroviral reverse transcripts. However, why multiple sensors might be required and their relative importance in in vivo control of retroviral infection are not known. Here, we show that DDX41 primarily senses the DNA/RNA hybrid generated at the first step of reverse transcription, while cGAS recognizes dsDNA generated at the next step. We also show that both DDX41 and cGAS are needed for the antiretroviral innate immune response to murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV in primary mouse macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Using mice with cell type-specific knockout of the Ddx41 gene, we show that DDX41 sensing in DCs but not macrophages was critical for controlling in vivo MLV infection. This suggests that DCs are essential in vivo targets for infection, as well as for initiating the antiviral response. Our work demonstrates that the innate immune response to retrovirus infection depends on multiple host nucleic acid sensors that recognize different reverse transcription intermediates.IMPORTANCE Viruses are detected by many different host sensors of nucleic acid, which in turn trigger innate immune responses, such as type I interferon (IFN) production, required to control infection. We show here that at least two sensors are needed to initiate a highly effective innate immune response to retroviruses-DDX41, which preferentially senses the RNA/DNA hybrid generated at the first step of retrovirus replication, and cGAS, which recognizes double-stranded DNA generated at the second step. Importantly, we demonstrate using mice lacking DDX41 or cGAS that both sensors are needed for the full antiviral response needed to control in vivo MLV infection. These findings underscore the need for multiple host factors to counteract retroviral infection.","['Stavrou, Spyridon', 'Aguilera, Alexya N', 'Blouch, Kristin', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Stavrou S', 'Aguilera AN', 'Blouch K', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA srross@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180605,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,IM,"['Animals', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/enzymology/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Macrophages/enzymology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*enzymology/genetics/*virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML/MDS', '*DEAD-box helicase', '*antiviral interferon response', '*cGAS', '*cytosolic sensing']",2018/06/07 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.00923-18 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00923-18 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2018 Jun 5;9(3). pii: mBio.00923-18. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00923-18.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (cGAS protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DDX41 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",,PMC5989071,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3094-3769'],['Copyright (c) 2018 Stavrou et al.'],"['F32 AI100512/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI085015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI121275/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A registry of the trinational fertility preservation network FertiPROTEKT including 992 patients aged 18-40 years undergoing ovarian stimulation and follicle aspiration for fertility preservation from 1/2007 until 3/2016 was analysed. The number of collected oocytes, days of stimulation, total gonadotropin dosage and gonadotropin dosage per day were evaluated. RESULTS: Total oocyte number was negatively correlated with increasing age (r = 0.237, p < 0.0001). Oocyte numbers were in women < 26 years 15.4 +/- 8.8, 26-30 years 13.1 +/- 8.5, 31-35 years 12.2 +/- 7.7 and 36-40 years 9.9 +/- 8.0. Age-adjusted oocyte numbers were not different in women with Hodgkin's lymphoma (12.6 +/- 8.8), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (12.4 +/- 8.2), leukaemia (11.7 +/- 8.2), sarcoma (11.8 +/- 8.2), cerebral cancer (16.5 +/- 8.1), gastrointestinal cancer (13.2 +/- 8.1) gynaecological cancer (10.8 +/- 8.2) and other types of malignancies (15.8 +/- 8.1) apart from ovarian cancer with lower oocyte yield (7.3 +/- 8.3, p < 0.001) compared to women with breast cancer (13.3 +/- 8.8). The total gonadotropin dose used for stimulation was only elevated in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma compared to women with breast cancer (p < 0.05). Oocyte yield was lower in women with versus without ovarian cancer (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: As ovarian response is not affected by the type of cancer, ovarian stimulation can be performed with the same oocyte yield in different malignant diseases. However, oocyte yield is reduced if ovarian surgery is required and in older women.","['von Wolff, M', 'Bruckner, T', 'Strowitzki, T', 'Germeyer, A']","['von Wolff M', 'Bruckner T', 'Strowitzki T', 'Germeyer A']","[""Division of Gynaecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Women's University Hospital, University of Berne, Effingerstrasse 102, 3010, Berne, Switzerland.

Therefore, we investigated long-term treatment outcomes of transplanted ALL patients aiming to identify prognostic factors and the impact of conditioning. We enrolled consecutive ALL patients transplanted from 1990 to 2016, following TBI- or busulfan (Bu)-based conditioning regimen. We studied 151 ALL patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR) (60), other CR (33), or relapsed/refractory disease (58) from sibling (87), and HLA-matched (42) or mismatched (17) unrelated and alternative donors (5). High-dose fractionated TBI-based conditioning was administered in 84. No differences were observed in baseline characteristics, except for disease stage at transplant, donor type, and graft source. With a follow-up of 19.0 (0.5-170.5) in TBI and 14.5 (1.2-319.1) months in non-TBI patients, there was no difference in acute (grades II-IV) or chronic GVHD, thrombotic microangiopathy, and bacterial or fungal infections. Only viral infections were significantly increased in the non-TBI group. There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence (CI) of treatment-related or relapse mortality and disease-free or overall survival (OS). In the multivariate analysis, unfavorable pre-transplant predictors of OS were age (p = 0.024), advanced disease stage (p = 0.007), and female-to-male donor (p = 0.006). Interestingly, TBI patients younger than 40 years had significantly higher OS (55.1%, p = 0.023) and DFS (48.6%, p = 0.020).

This study aimed to identify a promising biomarker for this disease. The study clarified (1) the association between Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1) and various molecular subtypes and (2) the prognostic value of FLI-1 in breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report that FLI-1 is a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer and overexpressed in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. To further verify the effect of FLI-1 in promoting the metastasis of TNBC, we performed a series of functional experiments in vitro and orthotopic xenograft experiments in the mammary fat pad of nude mice. FLI-1, as a transcription factor, bound to the promoters of key EMT-related genes (CDH1 and VIM), and regulated their expressions at the transcriptional level, thus induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The overexpression of FLI-1 significantly upregulated the expression of mesenchymal markers. After the modulation of FLI-1, the changes in mammary stem cell markers (ALDH1A1 and CD133) and the capacity to form mammospheres were consistent with those of the EMT-related markers. The orthotopic xenograft models further confirmed that the attenuation of stem cell traits after silencing FLI-1 decreased the ability of tumorigenesis. These results indicate that FLI-1 is a useful predictor of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the preliminary exploration of metastatic mechanism in the patients with TNBC will provide a potential target to treat breast cancer in the near future.","['Yan, Xu', 'Yu, Yu', 'Li, Lingyu', 'Chen, Naifei', 'Song, Wei', 'He, Hua', 'Dong, Jie', 'Liu, Xiangliang', 'Cui, Jiuwei']","['Yan X', 'Yu Y', 'Li L', 'Chen N', 'Song W', 'He H', 'Dong J', 'Liu X', 'Cui J']","['Pathological Diagnostic Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180604,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Friend leukemia virus integration 1', '*breast carcinoma', '*epithelial-mesenchymal transition', '*invasiveness', '*stemness']",2018/06/06 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1589 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2018 Aug;7(8):3548-3560. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1589.

This study proposes a meta-heuristic framework using stochastic local search (SLS) combined with random forest (RF) where the aim is to specify the most important genes and proteins leading to the best classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. First we use a stochastic local search meta-heuristic as a feature selection technique to select the most significant proteins to be used in the classification task step. Then we apply RF to classify new patients into their corresponding classes. The evaluation technique is to run the RF classifier on the training data to get a model. Then, we apply this model on the test data to find the appropriate class. We use as metrics the balanced accuracy (BAC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure the performance of our model. The proposed method is evaluated on the dataset issued from DREAM 9 challenge. The comparison is done with a pure random forest (without feature selection), and with the two best ranked results of the DREAM 9 challenge. We used three types of data: only clinical data, only proteomics data, and finally clinical and proteomics data combined. The numerical results show that the highest scores are obtained when using clinical data alone, and the lowest is obtained when using proteomics data alone. Further, our method succeeds in finding promising results compared to the methods presented in the DREAM challenge.","['Chebouba, Lokmane', 'Boughaci, Dalila', 'Guziolowski, Carito']","['Chebouba L', 'Boughaci D', 'Guziolowski C']","['Department of Computer Science, LRIA Laboratory, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Faculty, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene (USTHB), El-Alia BP 32, Bab-Ezzouar, Algiers, Algeria. lchebouba@gmail.com.', 'Department of Computer Science, LRIA Laboratory, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Faculty, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene (USTHB), El-Alia BP 32, Bab-Ezzouar, Algiers, Algeria.', 'LS2N, UMR 6004, Ecole Centrale de Nantes, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180604,United States,J Med Syst,Journal of medical systems,7806056,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', '*Proteomics', 'ROC Curve']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical data', 'Proteomics data', 'Random forest', 'Stochastic local search']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10916-018-0972-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10916-018-0972-z [pii]']",epublish,J Med Syst. 2018 Jun 4;42(7):129. doi: 10.1007/s10916-018-0972-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although one form of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is successfully treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), this drug is seemingly ineffective against all other forms of AML. Here, we show that ATRA up-regulates CD38 expression on AML blasts to sufficient levels that promote antibody-mediated fratricide following the addition of anti-CD38 daratumumab (DARA). The combination of ATRA plus DARA induced Fc-dependent conjugate formation and cytotoxicity among AML blasts in vitro. Combination treatment also led to reduction in tumor volume and resulted in increased overall survival in murine engraftment models of AML. These results suggest that, although ATRA does not induce differentiation of non-APL, it may be effective as a therapy in conjunction with DARA.","['Buteyn, Nathaniel J', 'Fatehchand, Kavin', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Fang, Huiqing', 'Dettorre, Gino M', 'Gautam, Shalini', 'Harrington, Bonnie K', 'Henderson, Sally E', 'Merchand-Reyes, Giovanna', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Benson, Don M', 'Carson, William E 3rd', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Byrd, John C', 'Butchar, Jonathan P', 'Tridandapani, Susheela']","['Buteyn NJ', 'Fatehchand K', 'Santhanam R', 'Fang H', 'Dettorre GM', 'Gautam S', 'Harrington BK', 'Henderson SE', 'Merchand-Reyes G', 'Mo X', 'Benson DM', 'Carson WE 3rd', 'Vasu S', 'Byrd JC', 'Butchar JP', 'Tridandapani S']","['Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/06/06 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['5032326 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxy040 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2018 Jul 24;30(8):375-383. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxy040.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,PMC6059202,,,"['R01 CA162411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA217006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 OD010429/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA203584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding how allo-HCT impacts the HIV reservoir will inform cure strategies. Methods: A 12-year-old with perinatally acquired, CCR5-tropic HIV and acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent myeloablative conditioning and umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation from a CCR532 homozygous donor. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the rectum were sampled pre- and post-transplant. The brain, lung, lymph node (LN), stomach, duodenum, ileum, and colon were sampled 73 days after transplantation (day +73), when the patient died from graft-vs-host disease. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) were used detect the HIV reservoir in tissues. CCR5 and CD3 expression in the LN was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: HIV DNA (vDNA) was detected in PBMCs by ddPCR pretransplant but not post-transplant. vDNA was detected by ISH in the rectum at days -8 and +22, and in the LN, colon, lung, and brain day +73. vDNA was also detected in the lung by ddPCR. IHC revealed CCR5+CD3+ cells in the LN postmortem. Conclusions: HIV was detected in multiple tissues 73 days after CCR532 homozygous UCB allo-HCT despite myeloablative conditioning and complete donor marrow engraftment. These results highlight the importance of analyzing tissue during HIV cure interventions and inform the choice of assay used to detect HIV in tissue reservoirs.","['Rothenberger, Meghan', 'Wagner, John E', 'Haase, Ashley', 'Richman, Douglas', 'Grzywacz, Bartosz', 'Strain, Matthew', 'Lada, Steven', 'Estes, Jacob', 'Fletcher, Courtney V', 'Podany, Anthony T', 'Anderson, Jodi', 'Schmidt, Thomas', 'Wietgrefe, Steve', 'Schacker, Timothy', 'Verneris, Michael R']","['Rothenberger M', 'Wagner JE', 'Haase A', 'Richman D', 'Grzywacz B', 'Strain M', 'Lada S', 'Estes J', 'Fletcher CV', 'Podany AT', 'Anderson J', 'Schmidt T', 'Wietgrefe S', 'Schacker T', 'Verneris MR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Veteran's Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California."", 'Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for AIDS Research, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.', ""Veteran's Affairs (VA) San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California."", 'Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'AIDS and Cancer Virus Program and Laboratory Animal Science Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CCR532', 'HIV cure', 'HIV reservoirs', 'allogeneic bone marrow transplantation']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/06/06 06:01,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofy090 [doi]', 'ofy090 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2018 May 22;5(5):ofy090. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofy090. eCollection 2018 May.,,,PMC5965100,,,"['UM1 AI126620/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI096109/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI100879/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI124965/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI074340/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous therapeutic mAbs that have been developed for myeloid neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), are currently investigated in clinical trials. Because AML and MDS originate from malignantly transformed hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells-the so-called leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that are highly resistant to most standard drugs-these malignancies frequently relapse and have a high disease-specific mortality. Therefore, combining standard chemotherapy with antileukemic mAbs that specifically target malignant blasts and particularly LSCs or utilizing mAbs that reinforce antileukemic host immunity holds great promise for improving patient outcomes. This review provides an overview of therapeutic mAbs for AML and MDS. Antibody targets, the molecular mechanisms of action, the efficacy in preclinical leukemia models, and the results of clinical trials are discussed. New developments and future studies of therapeutic mAbs in myeloid neoplasms will advance our understanding of the immunobiology of these diseases and enhance current therapeutic strategies.","['Schurch, Christian M']",['Schurch CM'],"['Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180518,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD33', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'leukemic stem cells', 'monoclonal antibody', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'targeted therapy']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/06/06 06:01,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00152 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 May 18;8:152. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00152. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5968093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also respond to cytokines undergoing proliferation and release of cytokines/chemokines. Although at the genomic level gammadelta T-cells have the potential of an extraordinary TCR diversification, in tissues they display a restricted repertoire. Recent studies have identified various gammadelta TCR rearrangements following either hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or cytomegalovirus infection, accounting for their ""adaptive"" potential. In humans, peripheral blood gammadelta T-cells are primarily composed of Vgamma9Vdelta2 chains, while a minor proportion express Vdelta1. They do not recognize antigens in the context of MHC molecules, thus bypassing tumor escape based on MHC class I downregulation. In view of their potent antileukemia activity and absence of any relevant graft-versus-host disease-inducing effect, gammadelta T-cells may play an important role in the successful clinical outcome of patients undergoing HLA-haploidentical HSCT depleted of TCR alphabeta T/CD19(+) B lymphocytes to cure high-risk acute leukemias. In this setting, high numbers of both gammadelta T-cells (Vdelta1 and Vdelta2) and NK cells are infused together with CD34(+) HSC and may contribute to rapid control of infections and leukemia relapse. Notably, zoledronic acid potentiates the cytolytic activity of gammadelta T-cells in vitro and its infusion in patients strongly promotes gammadelta T-cell differentiation and cytolytic activity; thus, treatment with this agent may contribute to further improve the patient clinical outcome after HLA-haploidentical HSCT depleted of TCR alphabeta T/CD19(+) B lymphocytes.","['Pistoia, Vito', 'Tumino, Nicola', 'Vacca, Paola', 'Veneziani, Irene', 'Moretta, Alessandro', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Moretta, Lorenzo']","['Pistoia V', 'Tumino N', 'Vacca P', 'Veneziani I', 'Moretta A', 'Locatelli F', 'Moretta L']","['Immunology Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Immunology Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Immunology Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Immunology Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale and Centro di Eccellenza per le Ricerche Biomediche, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology and Cell and Gene Therapy, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Science, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Immunology Area, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180507,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Genes, MHC Class I', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intraepithelial Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell depletion', '*HLA-haploidentical transplantation', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*receptors', '*alphabeta T-cell', '*gammadelta T-cells']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/06/06 06:01,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00984 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 May 7;9:984. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00984. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,PMC5949323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a number of therapeutic approaches, a cure for ATL is still in its infancy. Conventional chemotherapy has short-term efficacy, particularly in the acute subtype. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation offers long-term disease control to around one third of transplanted patients, but few can reach to transplant.

Meanwhile, new data have been accumulated on biological and molecular bases of HTLV-1 transforming and infecting activity. These data offer new rational for targeted therapies of ATL. Taking into account the double-face of ATL as an hematologic malignancy as well as a viral infectious disease, this Mini-Review seeks to provide an up-to-date overview of recent efforts in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in already used therapeutic regimens showing promising results, and in selecting novel drug targets for ATL.","['Marino-Merlo, Francesca', 'Mastino, Antonio', 'Grelli, Sandro', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Macchi, Beatrice']","['Marino-Merlo F', 'Mastino A', 'Grelli S', 'Hermine O', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Macchi B']","['IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ""Bonino-Pulejo"", Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, The National Research Council, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'INSERM U1163, CNRS ERL 8654, Department of Hematology, Imagine Institute, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'IRCCS Centro Neurolesi ""Bonino-Pulejo"", Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180509,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'antiviral agents', 'biological therapy', 'targeted therapy']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/06/06 06:01,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.00925 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 May 9;9:925. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00925. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5954109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In lung this can manifest as capillary leakage with pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or even pulmonary arterial hypertension. To understand how dasatinib causes endothelial dysfunction we examined the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib on both human pulmonary arterial macro- and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). The effects of dasatinib was compared to imatinib and nilotinib, two other clinically used BCR/Abl kinase inhibitors that do not inhibit Src. Real three-dimensional morphology and high resolution stiffness mapping revealed softening of both macro- and microvascular ECs upon dasatinib treatment, which was not observed in response to imatinib. In a dose-dependent manner, dasatinib decreased transendothelial electrical resistance/impedance and caused a permeability increase as well as disruption of tight adherens junctions in both cell types. In isolated perfused and ventilated rat lungs, dasatinib increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure, which was accompanied by a gain in lung weight. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 partly reversed the dasatinib-induced changes in vitro and ex vivo, presumably by acting downstream of Src. Co-administration of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 completely blunted the increased pulmonary pressure in response to dasatinib. In conclusion, a dasatinib-induced permeability increase in human pulmonary arterial macro- and microvascular ECs might explain many of the adverse effects of dasatinib in patients. Rho-kinase inhibition might be suitable to ameliorate these effects.","['Fazakas, Csilla', 'Nagaraj, Chandran', 'Zabini, Diana', 'Vegh, Attila G', 'Marsh, Leigh M', 'Wilhelm, Imola', 'Krizbai, Istvan A', 'Olschewski, Horst', 'Olschewski, Andrea', 'Balint, Zoltan']","['Fazakas C', 'Nagaraj C', 'Zabini D', 'Vegh AG', 'Marsh LM', 'Wilhelm I', 'Krizbai IA', 'Olschewski H', 'Olschewski A', 'Balint Z']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Biological Research Centre, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Biological Research Centre, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary.', 'Institute of Biophysics, Biological Research Centre, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary.', 'Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Graz, Austria.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180515,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Rho-kinase', 'dasatinib', 'endothelial cells', 'endothelial elasticity', 'paracellular permeability', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/06/06 06:01,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2018.00537 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2018 May 15;9:537. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00537. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5962749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the T-cells subset, upon activation the expression of Ca(2+)- or voltage-activated K(+) channels, KCa or Kv, is up-regulated. In this study, by means of patch-clamp technique in the whole cell mode, we have studied in detail the characteristics of Kv and KCa currents in resting and activated human T cells, the only well explored human T-leukemic cell line Jurkat, and two additional human leukemic T cell lines, CEM and MOLT-3. Voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of Kv1.3 current were shifted up to by 15 mV to more negative potentials upon a prolonged incubation in the whole cell mode and displayed little difference at a stable state in all cell lines but CEM, where the activation curve was biphasic, with a high and low potential components. In Jurkat, KCa currents were dominated by apamine-sensitive KCa2.2 channels, whereas only KCa3.1 current was detected in healthy T and leukemic CEM and MOLT-3 cells. Despite a high proliferation potential of Jurkat cells, Kv and KCa currents were unexpectedly small, more than 10-fold lesser as compared to activated healthy human T cells, CEM and MOLT-3, which displayed characteristic Kv1.3(high):KCa3.1(high) phenotype. Our results suggest that Jurkat cells represent perhaps a singular case and call for more extensive studies on primary leukemic T cell lines as well as a verification of the therapeutic potential of specific KCa3.1 blockers to combat acute lymphoblastic T leukemias.","['Valle-Reyes, Salvador', 'Valencia-Cruz, Georgina', 'Linan-Rico, Liliana', 'Pottosin, Igor', 'Dobrovinskaya, Oxana']","['Valle-Reyes S', 'Valencia-Cruz G', 'Linan-Rico L', 'Pottosin I', 'Dobrovinskaya O']","['Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Colima, Mexico.', 'Centro Universitario de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad de Colima, Colima, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180509,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T leukemia', 'T lymphocyte', 'calcium signaling', 'current density', 'potassium channel', 'voltage gating']",2018/06/06 06:00,2018/06/06 06:01,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2018.00499 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2018 May 9;9:499. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00499. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5954129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic use of arsenic is limited due to its severe cardiovascular side effects. The cardio-protective effect of salvianolic acid A (Sal A) against ATO cardiotoxicity has been reported. However, the distinct role of the mitochondria in the cardio-protection of Sal A is not understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether Sal A preconditioning protects against ATO-induced heart injury by maintaining cardiac mitochondrial function and biogenesis. For the in vivo study, BALB/c mice were treated with ATO and/or Sal A. For the in vitro study, we determined the effects of ATO and/or Sal A in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Our results showed that ATO induced mitochondrial structural damage, abnormal mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreased the ATP content. Sal A pretreatment alleviated the ATO-induced mitochondrial structural and functional damage. In this study, ATO decreased the expression level of the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma-coactivator 1 (PGC-1alpha) and disrupted the normal division and fusion of mitochondria. Sal A pretreatment improved the dynamic balance of the damaged mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the combination treatment of Sal A and ATO significantly enhanced the ATO-induced cytotoxicity of SGC7901, HepaRG, K562 and HL60 cells in vitro. These results indicated that Sal A protects the heart from ATO-induced injury, which correlates with the modulation of mitochondrial function, and the maintenance of normal mitochondrial biogenesis.","['Zhang, Jing-Yi', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Rui-Ying', 'Sun, Xiao', 'Du, Yu-Yang', 'Ye, Jing-Xue', 'Sun, Gui-Bo', 'Sun, Xiao-Bo']","['Zhang JY', 'Wang M', 'Wang RY', 'Sun X', 'Du YY', 'Ye

Numerous malignant diseases can cause hypereosinophilia, but it is seldom caused by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the event of protracted hypereosinophilia, it is extremely important to make a correct differential diagnosis. Case presentation: We present the case of an 11-year-old boy of Moroccan origin with ALL with hypereosinophilic onset (eosinophils in peripheral blood, 10,000/microL) in the absence of other signs of neoplastic disease, and compare this case with 61 similar cases in the literature. Following hospital admission, the patient initially presented with headache-caused nocturnal awakenings, evening fever, and cough, and he also lost approximately 7 kg in weight in a month not associated with sweating or itching. We first performed bone marrow aspiration, which showed an increase in eosinophils without cellular morphological abnormalities, and bone marrow immunophenotyping showed that 4.5% of cells had a phenotype compatible with lymphoid blasts. A lumbar puncture was negative. Given the poor marrow involvement, it was necessary to repeat a new bone marrow aspiration two days later, which showed an increase in blasts to 14%. A concomitant bone marrow biopsy showed an infiltration of blasts typical of B-cell ALL equal to 20(-)30% with associated hypereosinophilia. Cytogenetic analysis showed an hyperdiploid karyotype: 53(-)55, XY, +X, add(1)(q21q25), +4, +9, +10, +14, +2, +1, +21/46, XY. Conclusions: ALL is one of the possible causes of persistent hypereosinophilia. In patients with ALL and hypereosinophilia, peripheral hypereosinophilia can precede the appearance of blasts. Due to the negative prognosis and the increased risk of complications in these patients, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are recommended if common causes of secondary hypereosinophilia are excluded.","['Ferruzzi, Valentina', 'Santi, Elisa', 'Gurdo, Grazia', 'Arcioni, Francesco', 'Caniglia, Maurizio', 'Esposito, Susanna']","['Ferruzzi V', 'Santi E', 'Gurdo G', 'Arcioni F', 'Caniglia M', 'Esposito S']","['Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Piazza Menghini 1, 06132 Perugia, Italy. ferruvale@libero.it.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Piazza Menghini 1, 06132 Perugia, Italy. elisa.santi1988@gmail.com.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera, Piazza Menghini 1, 06132 Perugia, Italy. grazia.gurdo@ospedale.perugia.it.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera, Piazza Menghini 1, 06132 Perugia, Italy. francesco.arcioni@ospedale.perugia.it.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera, Piazza Menghini 1, 06132 Perugia, Italy. maurizio.caniglia@alice.it.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, Piazza Menghini 1, 06132 Perugia, Italy. susanna.esposito@unimi.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180604,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Morocco', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*blasts', '*bone marrow', '*hypereosinophilia', '*leukemia']",2018/06/06 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph15061169 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph15061169 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018 Jun 4;15(6). pii: ijerph15061169. doi: 10.3390/ijerph15061169.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,PMC6025476,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4103-2837'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing data supports the utility of allo-HCT in fit older patients after intensive chemotherapy resulting in improvement of outcomes. With the development of reduced intensity and non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that are associated with lower rates of treatment-related toxicity and mortality, this has allowed more older patients with AML to receive allo-HCT.

Without prophylaxis, up to 25% of pediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy will develop Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the preferred agent for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Pentamidine may be an acceptable alternative for pediatric patients unable to tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. A retrospective review was conducted of pediatric oncology patients who received >/=1 dose of pentamidine for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis between January 2007 and August 2014. Electronic medical records were reviewed to determine the incidence of breakthrough Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or discontinuation of pentamidine associated with adverse events. A total of 754 patients received pentamidine prophylaxis during the period. There were no cases of probable or proven Pneumocystis pneumonia, and 4 cases (0.5%) of possible Pneumocystis pneumonia. The incidence of possible breakthrough Pneumocystis pneumonia was not significantly different between subgroups based on age (<12 months [1.7%] versus >/=12 months [0.4%], P = 0.3), route of administration (aerosolized [0%] versus intravenous [1.0%], P = 0.2), or hematopoietic stem cell transplant status (transplant [0.4%] versus no transplant [0.8%], P = 0.6). Pentamidine was discontinued due to an adverse drug event in 23 children (3.1%), more frequently for aerosolized than for intravenous administration (7.6% versus 2.2%, respectively, P = 0.004).

Among these, somatic mutations that activate RAS oncogenes and inactivate the epigenetic modifier ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) frequently co-occur in human chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMMLs) and acute myeloid leukemias, suggesting a cooperativity in malignant transformation. To test this, we applied a conditional murine model that endogenously expressed oncogenic Nras(G12D) and monoallelic loss of Tet2 and explored the collaborative role specifically within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at disease initiation. We demonstrate that the 2 mutations collaborated to accelerate a transplantable CMML-like disease in vivo, with an overall shortened survival and increased disease penetrance compared with single mutants. At preleukemic stage, N-Ras(G12D) and Tet2 haploinsufficiency together induced balanced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation and enhanced competitiveness. Nras(G12D/+)/Tet2(+/-) HSCs displayed increased self-renewal in primary and secondary transplantations, with significantly higher reconstitution than single mutants. Strikingly, the 2 mutations together conferred long-term reconstitution and self-renewal potential to multipotent progenitors, a pool of cells that usually have limited self-renewal compared with HSCs. Moreover, HSPCs from Nras(G12D/+)/Tet2(+/-) mice displayed increased cytokine sensitivity in response to thrombopoietin. Therefore, our studies establish a novel tractable CMML model and provide insights into how dysregulated signaling pathways and epigenetic modifiers collaborate to modulate HSPC function and promote leukemogenesis.","['Jin, Xi', 'Qin, Tingting', 'Zhao, Meiling', 'Bailey, Nathanael', 'Liu, Lu', 'Yang, Kevin', 'Ng, Victor', 'Higashimoto, Tomoyasu', 'Coolon, Rosemary', 'Ney, Gina', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Li, Qing']","['Jin X', 'Qin T', 'Zhao M', 'Bailey N', 'Liu L', 'Yang K', 'Ng V', 'Higashimoto T', 'Coolon R', 'Ney G', 'Figueroa ME', 'Li Q']","['Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Miami, Miami, FL; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/06/06 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018017400 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017400 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 12;2(11):1259-1271. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017400.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Nras protein, mouse)']",,PMC5998937,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['R01 HL132392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007622/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Polysorp((R)) plate coated with 50ng of antigen/well and bovine serum diluted 1:100 gave the best results during standardization. Using sera from infected and non-infected cattle we set up the cutoff point at 0.320 (OD450nm) with a sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 100.0%. Then, we tested 1.187 serum samples from dairy (736 samples) and beef cattle (451 samples) with unknown status to BLV. We found that 31.1% (229/736) and 9.5% (43/451) of samples amongst dairy and beef cattle, respectively, had IgGs to BLV.

Phase 1/2 CHAMPION-1, the first study exploring once-weekly carfilzomib dosing, established the maximum tolerated dose at 70 mg/m(2) in combination with dexamethasone. We aimed to compare progression-free survival in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma given once weekly carfilzomib or twice weekly carfilzomib. METHODS: In this prespecified interim analysis of the randomised, open-label, phase 3 A.R.R.O.W. trial, we recruited patients (aged 18 years and older) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma previously treated with two or three treatments, including a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory agent, from hospital, clinic, oncology or medical centres. Key eligibility criteria were refractory to most recent therapy (including bortezomib or ixazomib) with measurable disease, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive carfilzomib once a week (70 mg/m(2)) or twice a week (27 mg/m(2)). The randomisation sequence was generated using a validated randomisation software and implemented using an interactive response technology system that assigned patients to treatment sequentially based on the randomisation sequence as patients were enrolled at participating clinical sites. Patients were stratified by International Staging System stage at study entry or baseline, whether or not they were refractory to bortezomib treatment, and age (block size of 4). The once weekly group received carfilzomib (30 min intravenous infusion) on days 1, 8, and 15 of all cycles (20 mg/m(2) day 1 [cycle 1]; 70 mg/m(2) thereafter). The twice weekly group received carfilzomib (10 min intravenous infusion) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 (20 mg/m(2) days 1 and 2 during cycle 1; 27 mg/m(2) thereafter). All patients received dexamethasone (40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 [all cycles] and 22 [cycles 1-9 only]). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival between groups in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analysis was done in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02412878, and is no longer enrolling patients. FINDINGS: Between September, 2015, and August, 2016, 578 patients were recruited from 118 sites. 478 patients were randomly assigned and included in the efficacy analyses (240 to receive once weekly carfilzomib; 238 to receive twice weekly carfilzomib). Median progression-free survival was higher in the once weekly group than the twice weekly group (11.2 months [95% CI 8.6-13.0] vs 7.6 months [5.8-9.2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.54-0.83; p=0.0029). The incidence of grade 3 or worse adverse events was higher in the once weekly group than the twice weekly group (68% [n=161] vs 62% [n=145]); the most common events were anaemia, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia (42 [18%] vs 42 [18%], 24 [10%] vs 16 [7%], and 17 [7%] vs 16 [7%], respectively for once weekly carfilzomib vs twice weekly carfilzomib). A lower proportion of patients had grade 3 or worse cardiac failure in the once weekly group (7 [3%]) than in the twice weekly group (10 [4%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in five (2%) of 238 patients in the once weekly group (sepsis [n=1], death [n=1], acute lung injury [n=1], acute respiratory distress syndrome [n=1], and tumour lysis syndrome [n=1]) and in two (1%) of 235 patients in the twice weekly group (plasma cell myeloma [n=1] and congestive heart failure [n=1]). There were 58 deaths in the once weekly group and 68 deaths in the twice weekly group at the time of data cutoff. INTERPRETATION: Once weekly carfilzomib at 70 mg/m(2) significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus the twice weekly schedule. Overall safety was comparable between the groups. Once weekly carfilzomib appears safe and more effective with a convenient dosing regimen versus the twice weekly schedule for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

Moore, was recently identified as a novel chemotherapy drug. Tetrandrine exhibited a potential antitumor effect on multiple types of cancer. Notably, an enhanced therapeutic efficacy was identified when tetrandrine was combined with a molecularly targeted agent. H89 is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase A and is an isoquinoline sulfonamide. METHODS: The effects of H89 combined with tetrandrine were investigated in vitro with respect to cell viability, apoptosis and autophagy, and synergy was assessed by calculation of the combination index. The mechanism was examined by western blot, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. This combination was also evaluated in a mouse xenograft model; tumor growth and tumor lysates were analyzed, and a TUNEL assay was performed. RESULTS: Combined treatment with H89 and tetrandrine exerts a mostly synergistic anti-tumor effect on human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo while sparing normal cells. Mechanistically, the combined therapy significantly induced cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy, which were mediated by ROS regulated PKA and ERK signaling. Moreover, Mcl-1 and c-Myc were shown to play a critical role in H89/tetrandrine combined treatment. Mcl-1 ectopic expression significantly diminished H89/tetrandrine sensitivity and amplified c-Myc sensitized cancer cells in the combined treatment. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the combination of tetrandrine and H89 exhibits an enhanced therapeutic effect and may become a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer patients. They also indicate a significant clinical application of tetrandrine in the treatment of human cancer. Moreover, the combination of H89/tetrandrine provides new selectively targeted therapeutic strategies for patients with c-Myc amplification.","['Yu, Man', 'Liu, Ting', 'Chen, Yicheng', 'Li, Yafang', 'Li, Wenhua']","['Yu M', 'Liu T', 'Chen Y', 'Li Y', 'Li W']","[""Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Cell Homeostasis, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, People's Republic of China. whli@whu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180604,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'C-Myc', 'Combination therapy', 'H89', 'Tetrandrine']",2018/06/06 06:00,2019/05/10 06:00,['2018/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-018-0779-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-018-0779-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Jun 4;37(1):114. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0779-2.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",,PMC5987653,,,"['2014CB910600/The National Basic Research Program of China', '81273540 and 81472684/The National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2042017KF0242/Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to determine whether miR-196a/b expression can serve as a prognostic factor for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Methods We enrolled 124 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. We measured miR-196a/b expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We classified patients into high and low expression groups based on the median expression value. Cox regression analyses were carried out to assess the prognostic significance of miR-196a/b expression in the context of well-established predictors. Results Patients with high miR-196a/b expression were older in age, and had higher white blood cell and platelet counts than did patients with low miR-196a/b expression. Patients with high miR-196a/b expression were associated with the French-American-British classification M5 subtype and with the presence of nucleophosmin and FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations, but were not associated with the favourable karyotype risk subgroup. Moreover, patients with high miR-196a/b expression had a shorter event-free survival rate compared with those with low miR-196a/b expression in univariate and multivariate analyses.

This study aimed to optimize the extraction conditions of the drimanes sesquiterpenes identified as 1-beta-(p-coumaroyloxy)-polygodial 1, drimanial 2 and 1-beta-(p-methoxycinnamoyl)-polygodial 3 in stem bark extracts. The HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated for the quantification of drimanes 1-3. The cytotoxic activity of these drimanes in human cancer cells, and the toxicological effects of the hydroethanolic extract, were determined. The extracts were prepared using different extractive conditions (solvents, plant: solvent ratio and time). The cytotoxicity effect was evaluated against leukemia, lymphomas, carcinomas and sarcomas cells using the tetrazolium assay (MTT). Furthermore, the acute toxicity was determined by measuring the biochemical parameters and by histopathological analysis. The hemolytic activity and micronucleus test were also performed. The method was linear, sensitive, precise and accurate for both drimanes 1-3. The best condition for extraction was using dichloromethane with plant: solvent proportion 1:10 (w/v) for six hours under dynamic maceration. Isolated drimanes exhibited cytotoxic effects with IC50 values ranging from 0.13 to 112.67 muM.

Anthocyanins are natural flavonoid pigments that possess a wide range of biological activities, including protection against cardiovascular diseases and induction of tumour cell apoptosis. We investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of cyanidin-3-o-beta-glucoside (Cy-3-g, the major bioactive compound in anthocyanins) on the apoptosis of human primary megakaryocytes and Meg-01 cell line in vitro. We found that Cy-3-g dose-dependently increased the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity in megakaryocytes from patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia but not in those from healthy volunteers. In Meg-01 cells, Cy-3-g regulated the distribution of Bak, Bax and Bcl-xL proteins in the mitochondria and cytosol, subsequently increasing cytochrome c release and stimulating caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine exposure. However, Cy-3-g did not exert significant effects on factor-associated suicide (Fas), Fas ligand, caspase-8 or Bid expression. Cy-3-g inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 activation by down-regulating inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase (IKK)alpha and IKKbeta expression, followed by the inhibition of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB)alpha phosphorylation and degradation and subsequent inhibition of the translocation of the p65 sub-unit into the nucleus, and finally stimulating caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine exposure. The inhibitory effect of Cy-3-g on NF-kappaB activation was mediated by the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling. U0126 (Erk1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) and 740 Y-P (PI3K agonist) significantly reversed Cy-3-g-reduced phosphorylation of p65. Taken together, our data indicate that Cy-3-g induces megakaryocyte apoptosis via the inhibition of NF-kappaB signalling, which may play important roles in regulating thrombopoiesis.","['Ya, Fuli', 'Li, Qing', 'Wang, Dongliang', 'Xie, Shuangfeng', 'Song, Fenglin', 'Gallant, Reid C', 'Tian, Zezhong', 'Wan, Jianbo', 'Ling, Wenhua', 'Yang, Yan']","['Ya F', 'Li Q', 'Wang D', 'Xie S', 'Song F', 'Gallant RC', 'Tian Z', 'Wan J', 'Ling W', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'School of Food Science, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Toronto Platelet Immunobiology Group, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China.', 'Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University (Northern Campus), Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180604,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,IM,"['Anthocyanins/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thrombopoiesis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/06/05 06:00,2019/09/17 06:00,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0038-1656551 [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2018 Jul;118(7):1215-1229. doi: 10.1055/s-0038-1656551.

However the ubiquitous expression of CD47, especially on the RBC, makes the targeted therapy facing safety risk issues. So, how to balance the safety and efficacy during CD47 inhibition is currently a major question. We had reported an anti-CD47 antibody ZF1 with potent anti-tumor effect. In this study, we further developed and assessed a novel fully human anti-CD47 antibody, AMMS4-G4, derived from ZF1 using affinity maturation. AMMS4-G4 exhibited equivalent anticancer effects with Hu5F9-G4, a humanized anti-CD47 antibody in clinical trial, on the potential of inducing significant phagocytosis of tumor cells in vitro and prolonging the survival of leukemia xenografted mice. Additionally, AMMS4-G4 significantly inhibited the growth of grafted solid tumors by enhancing macrophage infiltration and modestly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of opsonizing antibody and antiangiogenic therapy. In cynomolgus monkeys, AMMS4-G4 was safely administered, was well tolerated at doses of 30 and 60mg/kg, and did not produce serious adverse events, except for the reversible anemia, which was observed after 3 days and started to recover from 9 days later. Remarkably, it was proved by in vitro assay that Hu5F9-G4 induced RBC hemagglutination which wasn't observed in AMMS4-G4. On the whole, AMMS4-G4 was demonstrated to be a promising candidate with great potential and safe profile for cancer immunotherapy.","['Yu, Xiao-Yan', 'Qiu, Wei-Yi', 'Long, Feng', 'Yang, Xiao-Peng', 'Zhang, Chang', 'Xu, Lei', 'Chang, Hong-Yan', 'Du, Peng', 'Hou, Xiao-Juan', 'Yu, Yun-Zhou', 'Zeng, Da-di', 'Wang, Shuang', 'Sun, Zhi-Wei']","['Yu XY', 'Qiu WY', 'Long F', 'Yang XP', 'Zhang C', 'Xu L', 'Chang HY', 'Du P', 'Hou XJ', 'Yu YZ', 'Zeng DD', 'Wang S', 'Sun ZW']","['Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 20 Dongdajie Street, Fengtai District, Beijing, 100071, China.

However, little is known about the effects of RASSF6 on sorafenib resistance or the underlying mechanism. Here, we show that RASSF6 expression positively correlates with sorafenib sensitivity in RCC cells and human samples. Stable ectopic overexpression of RASSF6 in RCC cell lines reduces resistance to sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. At a molecular level, RASSF6 activates the JNK signaling pathway, which further contributes to Mcl-1 inhibition. Suppression of the JNK pathway can partially restore Mcl-1 expression and sorafenib resistance. Together, these findings suggest that RASSF6 inhibits sorafenib resistance by repressing Mcl-1 through the JNK-dependent pathway. RASSF6 may serve as a novel regulator for sorafenib therapy in RCC.","['Liang, Ying-Ying', 'Deng, Xu-Bin', 'Zeng, Li-Si', 'Lin, Xian-Tao', 'Shao, Xun-Fan', 'Wang, Bin', 'Mo, Zhi-Wen', 'Yuan, Ya-Wei']","['Liang YY', 'Deng XB', 'Zeng LS', 'Lin XT', 'Shao XF', 'Wang B', 'Mo ZW', 'Yuan YW']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

The aim of this study was to report the 10-year incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of MGCT at Thailand's national pediatric tertiary referral center. This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with MGCT at the Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital during 2005 to 2014. Eight patients (all male) were diagnosed with MGCT. Five of 8 patients were found to have hematologic abnormalities. Three patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (one patient with M1, another having M7, and the other with M0). Another patient had mixed MGCT with mediastinal myeloid sarcoma (MMS). The other patient had malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (M-HLH). Isochromosome 12p was detected in 3 patients (AML [2], mixed MGCT/MMS [1]). Four of 5 patients with hematologic abnormalities died of hematologic abnormalities or treatment complication (AML [3], M-HLH [1]). One patient with mixed MGCT/MMS survived with chemotherapy. All patients with AML and MMS were nonseminomatous MGCT and the onset of myeloid malignancies were within 1 year after the diagnosis of MGCT. Associated hematologic malignancies should be suspected in MGCT with abnormal blood count or hematologic symptoms. Isochromosome 12p was the most common cytogenetic finding in MGCT-associated myeloid malignancies patients. Those with nonseminomatous MGCT should have their blood count carefully monitored especially during the first year after the diagnosis of MGCT. Better treatment alternatives for MGCT with associated hematologic malignancies are warranted to ameliorate adverse outcomes.","['Sowithayasakul, Panjarat', 'Sinlapamongkolkul, Phakatip', 'Treetipsatit, Jitsupa', 'Vathana, Nassawee', 'Narkbunnam, Nattee', 'Sanpakit, Kleebsabai', 'Buaboonnam, Jassada']","['Sowithayasakul P', 'Sinlapamongkolkul P', 'Treetipsatit J', 'Vathana N', 'Narkbunnam N', 'Sanpakit K', 'Buaboonnam J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, PathumThani, Thailand.', 'Departments of Pathology.', 'Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok.', 'Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok.', 'Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok.', 'Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Mediastinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', '*Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Thailand']",,,2018/06/05 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001233 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Aug;40(6):450-455. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001233.,,,,,,,,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Apr;41(3):247-249.

However, the relapse rate by this treatment is high. Treatment of CD19 B-cell relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL) with allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells is safe and effective. Use of allogeneic CD19-CAR-T cells as a part of RIC regimens for treatment of r/r ALL patients with haploidentical HSCT has not been investigated yet. CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old girl with CD19 r/r ALL underwent haploidentical HSCT. The patient received fludarabine, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide combined with haploidentical donor-derived CD19-CAR-T cells as the conditioning regimen. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized bone marrow were infused on days 1 and 2, respectively. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus were administered on day 1, antithymocyte globulin was administered on days +14 and +15, and a short course of methotrexate was administered to prevent graft-versus-host disease. The time of peak CAR-T cell proliferation was detected after the first infusion of CAR-T cells on day 7. The patient's engraftment and full-donor cell engraftment were established. The disease was in complete remission with minimal residual disease, which was undetectable by flow cytometry. No graft-versus-host disease or serious cytokine-release syndrome was found. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of r/r ALL with RIC including CD19-CAR-T cells followed by allo-HSCT was safe and effective, which suggest that CAR-T cells can be used as a part of RIC regimens in the treatment of r/r ALL in haploidentical HSCT.","['Zhang, Cheng', 'Kong, Pei-Yan', 'Li, Shiqi', 'Chen, Ting', 'Ni, Xun', 'Li, Yunyan', 'Wang, Meiling', 'Liu, Yao', 'Gao, Lei', 'Gao, Li', 'Peng, Xian-Gui', 'Sun, Ai-Hua', 'Wang, Ping', 'Yang, Zhi', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Qian, Cheng']","['Zhang C', 'Kong PY', 'Li S', 'Chen T', 'Ni X', 'Li Y', 'Wang M', 'Liu Y', 'Gao L', 'Gao L', 'Peng XG', 'Sun AH', 'Wang P', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang X', 'Qian C']","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Center of Biological Therapy, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Center of Biological Therapy, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Center of Biological Therapy, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.', 'Center of Biological Therapy, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Center of Biological Therapy, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,"['Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/06/05 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000233 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2018 Jul/Aug;41(6):306-311. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000233.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Randomization to the hyper-C arm did not increase the CR rate or prolong EFS or OS. As a result of worse treatment tolerance, advanced age continuously affected CR rate, EFS, and OS, with 55 years as the best age cutoff. At 5 years, EFS was 55.7% (95% CI, 51.8% to 59.4%) for patients younger than 55 years of age versus 25.8% (95% CI, 19.9% to 35.6%) in older patients (hazard ratio, 2.16; P < .001). Patients >/= 55 years of age, in whom a lower compliance to the whole planned chemotherapy was observed, benefited significantly from hyper-C, whereas younger patients did not. Conclusion No significant benefit was associated with the introduction of a hyper-C sequence into a frontline pediatric-like adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Overall, tolerability of an intensive pediatric-derived treatment was poor in patients >/= 55 years of age.","['Huguet, Francoise', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Leguay, Thibaut', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Bonmati, Caroline', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Chalandon, Yves', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Huguet F', 'Chevret S', 'Leguay T', 'Thomas X', 'Boissel N', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Chevallier P', 'Hunault M', 'Vey N', 'Bonmati C', 'Lepretre S', 'Marolleau JP', 'Pabst T', 'Rousselot P', 'Buzyn A', 'Cahn JY', 'Lheritier V', 'Bene MC', 'Asnafi V', 'Delabesse E', 'Macintyre E', 'Chalandon Y', 'Ifrah N', 'Dombret H']","['Francoise Huguet, Eric Delabesse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer, Toulouse; Sylvie Chevret, Nicolas Boissel, Herve Dombret, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP); Universite Paris Diderot; Agnes Buzyn, Vahid Asnafi, Elizabeth Macintyre, Hopital Necker, AP-HP; Universite Paris Descartes, Paris; Thibaut Leguay, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Pessac; Xavier Thomas, Veronique Lheritier, Hopital Lyon-Sud, Pierre Benite; Martine Escoffre-Barbe, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Rennes; Patrice Chevallier, Marie C.

Widely known as a critical regulator in cellular physiology, BMI1 is essential in self-renewal and differentiation in different lineages of stem cells. BMI1 also plays a significant role in cancer etiology for its involvement in pathological progress such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell maintenance, propagation, and differentiation. Importantly, overexpression of BMI1 is predictive for drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and eventual therapy failure of various cancer subtypes, which renders the pharmacological targeting at BMI1 as a novel and promising therapeutic approach. The study on prostate cancer, a prevalent hormone-related cancer among men, has promoted enormous research advancements in cancer genetics and epigenetics. This review summarizes the role of BMI1 as an oncogenic and epigenetic regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and relapse of prostate cancer.","['Liu, Qipeng', 'Li, Qiaqia', 'Zhu, Sen', 'Yi, Yang', 'Cao, Qi']","['Liu Q', 'Li Q', 'Zhu S', 'Yi Y', 'Cao Q']","['Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Center for Inflammation and Epigenetics, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,China,Asian J Androl,Asian journal of andrology,100942132,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region 1', '*oncogene', '*polycomb repressive complex 1', '*prostate cancer']",2018/06/05 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['233684 [pii]', '10.4103/aja.aja_38_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian J Androl. 2019 May-Jun;21(3):224-232. doi: 10.4103/aja.aja_38_18.,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,PMC6498728,,,['R01 CA208257/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the immunomodulatory effects of Curcuma longa L., purple sweet potato, and mixtures of the two (CPM) were investigated in C57BL/6 mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV). Mice were divided into seven groups as follows: normal control, infected control (LP-BM5 MuLV infection), positive control (LP-BM5 MuLV infection+dietary supplement of red ginseng 300 mg/kg body weight), the original powder of C. longa L. (C; LP-BM5 MuLV infection+dietary supplement of C 189 mg/kg body weight), the original powder of purple sweet potato (P; LP-BM5 MuLV infection+dietary supplement of P 1811 mg/kg body weight), CPM Low (CPL; LP-BM5 MuLV infection+CPM 2 g/kg body weight), and CPM High (CPH; LP-BM5 MuLV infection+CPM 5 g/kg body weight). Dietary supplementation lasted for 12 weeks. Dietary supplementation of CPM inhibited LP-BM5 MuLV-induced lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and inhibited reduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II. Moreover, CPM reduced the decrease in T- and B cell proliferation, reduced the population of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells, and remedied the unbalanced production of T helper-1 (Th1)/T helper-2 (Th2) cytokines in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mice. In addition, CPM inhibited reduction of phagocytosis in peritoneal macrophages and decreased serum levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin E (IgE), and immunoglobulin G (IgG). These results suggest that CPM had a positive effect on immunomodulation in C57BL/6 mice induced by LP-BM5 leukemia retrovirus infection.","['Park, Soo-Jeung', 'Lee, Dasom', 'Lee, Minhee', 'Kwon, Han-Ol', 'Kim, Hyesook', 'Park, Jeongjin', 'Jeon, Woojin', 'Cha, Minseok', 'Jun, Suhwa', 'Park, Kwangjin', 'Lee, Jeongmin']","['Park SJ', 'Lee D', 'Lee M', 'Kwon HO', 'Kim H', 'Park J', 'Jeon W', 'Cha M', 'Jun S', 'Park K', 'Lee J']","['1 Department of Medical Nutrition, Kyung Hee University , Yongin, Korea.', '1 Department of Medical Nutrition, Kyung Hee University , Yongin, Korea.', '1 Department of Medical Nutrition, Kyung Hee University , Yongin, Korea.', '2 Korea Ginseng Corporation Research Institute , Korea Ginseng Corporation, Daejeon, Korea.', '3 Department of East-West Medicine, Kyung Hee University , Yongin, Korea.', '4 Department of Food and Nutrition, Chonnam National University , Gwangju, Korea.', '4 Department of Food and Nutrition, Chonnam National University , Gwangju, Korea.', '5 SDC Research & Development Center , Damyang-gun, Korea.', '5 SDC Research & Development Center , Damyang-gun, Korea.', '5 SDC Research & Development Center , Damyang-gun, Korea.', '1 Department of Medical Nutrition, Kyung Hee University , Yongin, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180604,United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Curcuma/*chemistry', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ipomoea batatas/*chemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Curcuma longa L002E', 'LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses', 'immunomodulation']",2018/06/05 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jmf.2017.4093 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2018 Jul;21(7):689-700. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2017.4093.

The aim of this work was to retrospectively analyze the long-term survival rate and frequency of therapy-related myeloid neoplasia (t-MN) occurring in a large cohort of APL patients. A total of 760 newly diagnosed patients with APL between January 1999 and May 2016 were evaluated. The early death rate was 9.2% (70/760). Of the remaining 690 patients with complete remission, patients were grouped according to front-line regimens: ATRA plus ATO with or without chemotherapy (ATO group) and ATRA with chemotherapy (non-ATO group). The median duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (1.0-18.3 years). ATO group showed significant superior 10-year estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) up to 90.3% comparing with 65.5% in the non-ATO group (P < 0.0001). In addition, the 10-year estimated overall survival (OS) was 93.9% for patients in the ATO group and 89.1% for those in the non-ATO group (P = 0.03). In the subgroup analysis, the RFS rate was also higher in ATO group comparing with non-ATO group in both low-to-intermediate-risk (94.2% vs 64.6%, P < 0.0001) and high-risk subgroup (89.6% vs 74.7%, P = 0.04). Notably, the 3-year RFS and OS rates in the chemotherapy-free subgroup of the low-to-intermediate-risk patients (n = 88) were 100% and 100%, respectively. In the entire cohort, a total of 10 patients developed secondary malignant neoplasms, including 7 patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). The estimated 5-year cumulative incidence risk of t-MN in the ATO and non-ATO groups was 1.0% and 0.4%, respectively (P = 0.34). Thus, our data revealed that the long-term outcome of patients treated with ATRA plus ATO-based regimens was associated with continuing high efficacy in all Sanz risk patients with newly diagnosed APL.","['Lou, Yinjun', 'Lu, Ying', 'Zhu, Zhijuan', 'Ma, Yafang', 'Suo, Shanshan', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Chen, Dong', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Qian, Wenbin', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Mai, Wenyuan', 'Yu, Wenjun', 'Xu, Weilai', 'Wang, Lei', 'Mao, Liping', 'Pei, Renzhi', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lou Y', 'Lu Y', 'Zhu Z', 'Ma Y', 'Suo S', 'Wang Y', 'Chen D', 'Tong H', 'Qian W', 'Meng H', 'Mai W', 'Yu W', 'Xu W', 'Wang L', 'Mao L', 'Pei R', 'Jin J']","[""Department of Hematology, Leukemia center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, College of Medicine;

Lenalidomide had activity in early monotherapy trials, but tumour lysis and flare proved major obstacles in its development. We combined lenalidomide in increasing doses with six cycles of fludarabine and rituximab (FR), followed by lenalidomide/rituximab maintenance. In 45 chemo-naive patients, included in this trial, individual tolerability of the combination was highly divergent and no systematic toxicity determining a maximum tolerated dose was found. Grade 3/4 neutropenia (71%) was high, but only 7% experienced grade 3 infections. No tumour lysis or flare > grade 2 was observed, but skin toxicity proved dose-limiting in nine patients (20%). Overall and complete response rates after induction were 89 and 44% by intention-to-treat, respectively. At a median follow-up of 78.7 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 60.3 months. Minimal residual disease and immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain mutation state predicted PFS and TP53 mutation most strongly predicted OS. Baseline clinical factors did not predict tolerance to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, but pretreatment immunophenotypes of T cells showed exhausted memory CD4 cells to predict early dose-limiting non-haematologic events.

Given the gonadotoxicity of high-dose induction chemotherapy and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplant, it is paramount that fertility preservation options are discussed and explored at the time of diagnosis as fertility preservation has been associated with greater quality of life in survivors. Starting the conversation early is especially important for female patients given the time needed for all currently available fertility preservation techniques. Furthermore, due to a lack of current guidelines for the optimal timing of treatment, patients often encounter difficulties trying to balance life-saving treatment and fertility preservation. We present a case of female patient of reproductive age diagnosed with AML who opted for ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, and subsequent IVF following a cycle of induction chemotherapy with satisfactory results for both embryo generation and disease treatment.","['Ye, Rebecca', 'Tomlinson, Benjamin', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Malek, Ehsan']","['Ye R', 'Tomlinson B', 'de Lima M', 'Malek E']","['Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Adult Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplant Section, Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Adult Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplant Section, Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Adult Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplant Section, Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180513,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,2018/06/05 06:00,2018/06/05 06:01,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2017/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/9807047 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2018 May 13;2018:9807047. doi: 10.1155/2018/9807047. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5971287,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8568-4522', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4719-4327']",,['K12 CA076917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have synthesized several oxidation products of DIM-Ph-4-CF3, focusing on analogs with electron-withdrawing or donating groups at their phenyl ring 4-positions, and examined their anti-cancer activity and mechanism-of-action. Mesylates (DIM-Ph-4-X(+) OMs(-)s) having CF3, CO2Me and Cl groups were more effective inhibitors of cancer cell viability than their precursors. (19)F NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry strongly indicated interactions of DIM-Ph-4-CF3(+) OMs(-) with the NR4A1 ligand binding domain, and compound-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells was dependent on NR4A1. DIM-Ph-4-CF3(+) OMs(-) showed robust inhibition of LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts with no apparent toxicity. In vitro and in vivo, DIM-Ph-4-CF3(+) OMs(-) activated proapoptotic unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling in prostate cancer cells. Independently of DIM-Ph-4-CF3(+) OMs(-), the bulk of NR4A1 localized to the cytoplasm in various cancer cell lines, suggesting a cytoplasmic mechanism-of-action of DIM-Ph-4-CF3(+) OMs(-) in UPR induction and cell death.

Recently, we demonstrated that oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) is a predominant pathway in CLL for energy production and is further augmented in the presence of the stromal microenvironment. Importantly, CLL cells from patients with poor prognostic markers showed increased OxPhos. From these data, we theorized that OxPhos can be targeted to treat CLL. IACS-010759, currently in clinical development, is a small-molecule, orally bioavailable OxPhos inhibitor that targets mitochondrial complex I. Treatment of primary CLL cells with IACS-010759 greatly inhibited OxPhos but caused only minor cell death at 24 and 48 h. In the presence of stroma, the drug successfully inhibited OxPhos and diminished intracellular ribonucleotide pools. However, glycolysis and glucose uptake were induced as compensatory mechanisms. To mitigate the upregulated glycolytic flux, we used 2-deoxy-D-glucose in combination with IACS-010759. This combination reduced both OxPhos and glycolysis and induced cell death. Consistent with these data, low-glucose culture conditions sensitized CLL cells to IACS-010759. Collectively, these data suggest that CLL cells adapt to use a different metabolic pathway when OxPhos is inhibited and that targeting both OxPhos and glycolysis pathways is necessary for biological effect.","['Vangapandu, Hima V', 'Alston, Brandon', 'Morse, Joshua', 'Ayres, Mary L', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Marszalek, Joseph R', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Vangapandu HV', 'Alston B', 'Morse J', 'Ayres ML', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Marszalek JR', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Applied Cancer Science and the Center for Co-Clinical Trials, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180518,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-dG', 'IACS-010759', 'OxPhos', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria']",2018/06/05 06:00,2018/06/05 06:01,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2017/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25166 [doi]', '25166 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 18;9(38):24980-24991. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25166. eCollection 2018 May 18.,,,PMC5982765,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no financial or other conflicts of', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2017, 553 consecutive patients with de novo AML were screened for CEBPA mutations. Out of these, 81 patients classified as CEBPA(dm) were analyzed further by a sensitive next-generation sequencing assay for mutations in 112 candidate genes. Within the CEBPA gene itself, we found 164 mutations. The most common mutated sites were c.936_937insGAG (n = 11/164, 6.71%) and c.939_940insAAG (n = 11/164, 6.71%), followed by c.68dupC (n = 10/164, 6.10%). The most common co-occurring mutations were found in the CSF3R (n = 16/81, 19.75%), WT1 (n = 15/81, 18.52%), and GATA2 (n = 13/81, 16.05%) genes. Patients with CSF3R mutations had an inferior four-year relapse-free survival (RFS) than those with the wild-type gene (15.3% versus 46.8%, respectively; P = 0.021). Patients with WT1 mutations had an inferior five-year RFS compared with those without such mutations (0% versus 26.6%, respectively, P = 0.003). However, GATA2, CSF3R, WT1 mutations had no significant influence on the overall survival. There were some differences in the location of mutational hotspots within the CEBPA gene, as well as hotspots of other co-occurring genetic mutations, between AML patients from Chinese and Caucasian populations. Some co-occurring mutations may be potential candidates for refining the prognoses of AML patients with CEBPA(dm) in the Chinese population.","['Su, Long', 'Tan, YeHui', 'Lin, Hai', 'Liu, XiaoLiang', 'Yu, Li', 'Yang, YanPing', 'Liu, ShanShan', 'Bai, Ou', 'Yang, Yan', 'Jin, FengYan', 'Sun, JingNan', 'Liu, ChunShui', 'Liu, QiuJu', 'Gao, SuJun', 'Li, Wei']","['Su L', 'Tan Y', 'Lin H', 'Liu X', 'Yu L', 'Yang Y', 'Liu S', 'Bai O', 'Yang Y', 'Jin F', 'Sun J', 'Liu C', 'Liu Q', 'Gao S', 'Li W']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180103,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CEBPA mutations', 'Chinese population', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'next generation sequencing', 'prognoses']",2018/06/05 06:00,2018/06/05 06:01,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.23873 [doi]', '23873 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jan 3;9(38):24970-24979. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.23873. eCollection 2018 May 18.,,,PMC5982761,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably EBV(+) RT was associated with a trend for older age at onset (median 72 vs. 63 years, p value >0.05), longer interval between CLL and RT diagnosis (median 4.2 vs. 2.9 years, p value >0.05), and shorter overall survival (median 4 vs. 10 months, p value >0.05). These differences were not significant, probably due to small sample size. Immunohistochemical profiling suggested more frequent overexpression of TP53 and MYC in EBV(-) compared to EBV(+) secondary lymphoma. Based on this small retrospective single center series, we hypothesize that EBV(+) RT may constitute a separate subgroup of RT. Larger series are required to validate this suggestion.","['Morscio, Julie', 'Bittoun, Emilie', 'Volders, Nathalie', 'Lurquin, Eveline', 'Wlodarska, Iwona', 'Gheysens, Olivier', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Demaerel, Philippe', 'Dierickx, Daan', 'Sagaert, Xavier', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Tousseyn, Thomas']","['Morscio J', 'Bittoun E', 'Volders N', 'Lurquin E', 'Wlodarska I', 'Gheysens O', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Verhoef G', 'Demaerel P', 'Dierickx D', 'Sagaert X', 'Janssens A', 'Tousseyn T']","['1Department of Imaging and Pathology, Lab for Translational Cell and Tissue Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '1Department of Imaging and Pathology, Lab for Translational Cell and Tissue Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '1Department of Imaging and Pathology, Lab for Translational Cell and Tissue Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '2Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '3Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '4Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '3Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '5Hematology Department, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '6Department of Radiology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '5Hematology Department, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '1Department of Imaging and Pathology, Lab for Translational Cell and Tissue Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '2Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '5Hematology Department, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f', '1Department of Imaging and Pathology, Lab for Translational Cell and Tissue Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0001 0668 7884grid.5596.f', '2Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.0000 0004 0626 3338grid.410569.f']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160521,Germany,J Hematop,Journal of hematopathology,101491976,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'Immunodeficiency-related lymphoma', 'Immunomodulatory agent-related lymphoproliferation', 'Immunosuppression-related lymphoproliferation', 'Richter transformation']",2016/05/21 00:00,2016/05/21 00:01,['2018/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12308-016-0273-8 [doi]', '273 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematop. 2016 May 21;9:113-120. doi: 10.1007/s12308-016-0273-8. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5962620,,,,,"['Compliance with ethical standardsJulie Morscio, Emilie Bittoun, Nathalie Volders,', 'Eveline Lurquin, Iwona Wlodarska, Olivier Gheysens, Peter Vandenberghe, Gregor', 'Verhoef, Philippe Demaerel, Daan Dierickx, Xavier Sagaert, Ann Janssens, and', 'Thomas Tousseyn declare that they have no conflict of interest.This study was', 'funded by the K.U.

With the aim of finding promising candidates for chemotherapy, 91 native and naturalized plants collected from the central region of Argentina were screened for their cytotoxic effect toward sensitive and MDR P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpressing human leukemia cells by means of MTT assays. The ethanol extracts obtained from Aldama tucumanensis, Ambrosia elatior, Baccharis artemisioides, Baccharis coridifolia, Dimerostemma aspilioides, Gaillardia megapotamica, and Vernonanthura nudiflora presented outstanding antiproliferative activity at 50 mug/mL, with inhibitory values from 93 to 100%, when tested on the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line CCRF-CEM and the resistant derivative CEM-ADR5000, while 70-90% inhibition was observed against the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell K562 and its corresponding resistant subline, Lucena 1. Subsequent investigation showed these extracts to possess marked cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.37 to 29.44 mug/mL, with most of them being below 7 mug/mL and with ALL cells, including the drug-resistant phenotype, being the most affected. G. megapotamica extract found to be one of the most effective and bioguided fractionation yielded helenalin (1). The sesquiterpene lactone displayed IC50 values of 0.63, 0.19, 0.74, and 0.16 mug/mL against K562, CCRF-CEM, Lucena 1, and CEM/ADR5000, respectively. These results support the potential of these extracts as a source of compounds for treating sensitive and multidrug-resistant leukemia cells and support compound 1 as a lead for developing effective anticancer agents.","['Gonzalez, Maria Laura', 'Joray, Mariana Belen', 'Laiolo, Jeronimo', 'Crespo, Maria Ines', 'Palacios, Sara Maria', 'Ruiz, Gustavo Miguel', 'Carpinella, Maria Cecilia']","['Gonzalez ML', 'Joray MB', 'Laiolo J', 'Crespo MI', 'Palacios SM', 'Ruiz GM', 'Carpinella MC']","['Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, IRNASUS-CONICET, Catholic University of Cordoba, Avda.

During the long culture period, the cESCs showed typical ES cell morphology and expressed primitive stem cell markers with a relatively stable proliferation rate and high telomerase activity. These cells also exhibited the capability to differentiate into cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells, neural cells, osteoblast, and adipocyte in vitro.

Moreover, cell migration molecules, Fascin-1 and Versican are involved in proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. They are linked to many human cancers. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate both the plasma and leukocytes concentrations of tumor necrosis factor receptor super family 2 (TNFRSF2), TNFRSF9, Fascin-1 and Versican in patients with acute leukemia, as well as to correlate these values with clinical features and treatment outcome. Therefore, forty-eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), thirty-two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and fifteen control subjects were included. TNFRSF2, TNFRSF9, Fascin-1 and Versican were measured in plasma and leukocytes of all subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that plasma TNFRSF9 was highly elevated in ALL and AML as compared with the control group. In addition, AML patients who failed to achieve complete remission showed a significant increase in leukocytes TNFRSF9 level. TNFRSF2 is significantly increased in plasma and leukocytes of ALL patients when compared with the control group and AML patients. Fascin-1 significantly increased in AML, but not in ALL cases. Plasma and leukocytes levels of Versican significantly increased in AML compared to both control and ALL subjects. Plasma Versican correlated with poor response to induction of chemotherapy in AML cases. In conclusion, TNFRSF2 and TNFRSF9 could act as a possible prognostic biomarkers for the outcomes of ALL patients and TNFRSF9 could be a potential target in AML. Versican may be used as a diagnostic biomarker and as a predictor of the response to chemotherapy in AML. In addition, plasma Fascin-1 is a potential biomarker for AML.","['El Kramani, Nabila', 'Elsherbiny, Nehal M', 'El-Gayar, Amal M', 'Ebrahim, Mohamed A', 'Al-Gayyar, Mohammed M H']","['El Kramani N', 'Elsherbiny NM', 'El-Gayar AM', 'Ebrahim MA', 'Al-Gayyar MMH']","['Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Delta University for Science and Technology, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Mansoura, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Mansoura, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Mansoura, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Mansoura, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia.

The piggyBac transposon system offers a less complex and more economical means for generating CAR19 T cells compared to viral vectors. We have previously optimized a protocol for the generation of CAR19 T cells using the piggyBac system, but we found that CAR19 T cells had poor in vivo efficacy and persistence, probably due to deleterious FcgammaR interactions with the CAR's IgG1 Fc-containing spacer domain. We therefore designed three CD19-specifc CARs that lacked the IgG1 Fc region, and we incorporated combinations of CD28 or 4-1BB transmembrane and co-stimulatory domains. PiggyBac-generated CAR19 T cells expressing these re-designed constructs all demonstrated reactivity in vitro specifically against CD19(+) cell lines. However, those combining CD28 transmembrane and co-stimulatory domains showed CD4 predominance and inferior cytotoxicity. At high doses, CAR19 T cells were effective against B-ALL in a xenograft mouse model, regardless of co-stimulatory domain. At diminishing doses, 4-1BB co-stimulation led to greater potency and persistence of CAR19 T cells, and it provided protection against B-ALL re-challenge. Production of potent CAR T cells using piggyBac is simple and cost-effective, and it may enable wider access to CAR T cell therapy.","['Bishop, David C', 'Xu, Ning', 'Tse, Benjamin', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Gottlieb, David J', 'Dolnikov, Alla', 'Micklethwaite, Kenneth P']","['Bishop DC', 'Xu N', 'Tse B', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Gottlieb DJ', 'Dolnikov A', 'Micklethwaite KP']","['Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Blood & Marrow Transplant Facility, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Blood & Marrow Transplant Facility, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Department of Medicine, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Blood & Marrow Transplant Facility, Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy in IDH1-mutated AML. Safety and efficacy were assessed in all treated patients. The primary efficacy population included patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving 500 mg of ivosidenib daily with at least 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 258 patients received ivosidenib and had safety outcomes assessed. Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML (179 patients), treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred in at least 3 patients were prolongation of the QT interval (in 7.8% of the patients), the IDH differentiation syndrome (in 3.9%), anemia (in 2.2%), thrombocytopenia or a decrease in the platelet count (in 3.4%), and leukocytosis (in 1.7%). In the primary efficacy population (125 patients), the rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery was 30.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.5 to 39.3), the rate of complete remission was 21.6% (95% CI, 14.7 to 29.8), and the overall response rate was 41.6% (95% CI, 32.9 to 50.8). The median durations of these responses were 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.0), 9.3 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 18.3), and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3), respectively. Transfusion independence was attained in 29 of 84 patients (35%), and patients who had a response had fewer infections and febrile neutropenia episodes than those who did not have a response. Among 34 patients who had a complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, 7 (21%) had no residual detectable IDH1 mutations on digital polymerase-chain-reaction assay. No preexisting co-occurring single gene mutation predicted clinical response or resistance to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced IDH1-mutated relapsed or refractory AML, ivosidenib at a dose of 500 mg daily was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and with transfusion independence, durable remissions, and molecular remissions in some patients with complete remission.

Management of infectious complications during chemotherapy has a key role in the supportive care of AML patients. METHODS: By using case report forms collected in December 2001 and December 2005, we retrospectively analyzed the infectious complications in adult patients treated by using the JALSG AML201 protocols against AML (excluding promyelocytic leukemia). RESULTS: Of 980 patients, 80.2% experienced febrile neutropenia (FN), 8.3% bacteremia/fungemia, and 10.3% pulmonary infection at least once during remission-induction chemotherapy. Gram-positive bacteremia accounted for 65.1% of bacteremia/fungemia in 2001-2005, compared with 38.2% in 1987-1991 and 45.9% in 1992-1995. Of 750 patients, 81.9% experienced FN, 21.9% bacteremia/fungemia, and 9.1% pulmonary infection at least once during consolidation chemotherapy. During consolidation chemotherapy, bacteremia/fungemia and pulmonary infection were significantly more frequent in the high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) arm than in the conventional multiagent arm (25.9 vs. 17.9% and 12.7 vs. 7.7%, respectively). Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis accounted for 15.8% of pulmonary infections during remission induction and 19.7% during consolidation chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patterns of infectious complications have changed between 1987 and 2005, possibly because of chemoprophylaxis with oral fluoroquinolones and improved diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by serum antigen analysis.","['Kato, Hideaki', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Akiyama, Nobu', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Hiramoto, Nobuhiro', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Takahashi, Tsutomu', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Minamiguchi, Hitoshi', 'Miyatake, Junichi', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Yoshida, Minoru', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Kato H', 'Fujita H', 'Akiyama N', 'Kimura SI', 'Hiramoto N', 'Hosono N', 'Takahashi T', 'Shigeno K', 'Minamiguchi H', 'Miyatake J', 'Handa H', 'Kanda Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Miyawaki S', 'Ohtake S', 'Naoe T', 'Kiyoi H', 'Matsumura I', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saiseikai Yokohama Nanbu Hospital, Yokohama, Japan. fujitah@nanbu.saiseikai.or.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sakai Hospital Kinki University Faculty of Medicine, Sakai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Mizonokuchi Hospital, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Higashiosaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20180602,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bacteremia', 'Febrile neutropenia', 'Infectious complication', 'Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG)']",2018/06/04 06:00,2018/12/15 06:00,['2018/06/04 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-018-4292-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-018-4292-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2018 Dec;26(12):4187-4198. doi: 10.1007/s00520-018-4292-0.

The evolution from low-risk to high-risk MDS and finally to sAML suggests that leukemogenesis is a multistep process. However, even before an overt neoplasm, such as an MDS, develops, ""prediagnostic"" clonal conditions may be identified. With the advent of large-scale genomic screens, such conditions may be detected quite frequently and early in apparently healthy individuals. Recent data suggest that these conditions increase with age and are indeed associated with an increased risk of the occurrence of MDS or another myeloid neoplasm. In other patients, unexplained cytopenia may be detected and may precede MDS. More recently, diagnostic criteria for potential pre-MDS conditions, including idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance and clonal hematopoiesis with indeterminate potential, have been proposed. The current article provides an overview of pre-MDS states and related criteria through which these conditions can be discriminated from each other and from MDS. In addition, the clinical implications and management of pre-MDS states are discussed.","['Valent, Peter']",['Valent P'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austriapeter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austriapeter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180601,Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*diagnosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Clonal cytopenia of unknown significance', 'Clonal hematopoiesis with indeterminate potential', 'Diagnostic criteria', 'Idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance', 'Idiopathic dysplasia of unknown significance', 'Myeloid neoplasms']",2018/06/04 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2018/06/04 06:00'],"['2018/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['000489042 [pii]', '10.1159/000489042 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2019;86(1):30-38. doi: 10.1159/000489042.

Although direct BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as imatinib, were initially successful in the treatment of leukemia, many patients developed drug resistance over time due to the gatekeeper mutation of BCR-ABL T315I. In the present study, we found that taxodione, a quinone methide diterpene isolated from Taxodium distichum, significantly induced apoptosis in human myelogenous leukemia-derived K562 cells, which were transformed by BCR-ABL. Taxodione reduced the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes III and V, which appeared to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant agent, canceled taxodione-induced ROS production, reductions in MRC activities, particularly complex V, and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, in K562 cells treated with taxodione, BCR-ABL and its major signaling molecules, such as STAT5 and Akt were sequestered in mitochondrial fraction, and their localization changes decrease their abilities to stimulate cell proliferation, suggesting that these actions seem to be a mechanism how taxodione functions as an anti-tumor drug. Strikingly, NAC canceled these taxodione-caused anti-cancer effects. Taxodione induced apoptosis in transformed Ba/F3 cells induced not only by BCR-ABL, but also T315I-mutated BCR-ABL through the generation of ROS. Collectively, the present results suggest that in the treatment of leukemia, taxodione has potential as a compound with high efficacy to overcome BCR-ABL T315I mutation-mediated resistance in leukemia cells.","['Uchihara, Yuki', 'Tago, Kenji', 'Taguchi, Hidetoshi', 'Narukawa, Yuji', 'Kiuchi, Fumiyuki', 'Tamura, Hiroomi', 'Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi']","['Uchihara Y', 'Tago K', 'Taguchi H', 'Narukawa Y', 'Kiuchi F', 'Tamura H', 'Funakoshi-Tago M']","['Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Structural Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi-ken 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Natural Medicines, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Natural Medicines, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.', 'Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.

Quizartinib is an oral, highly potent, and selective next-generation FLT3 inhibitor with clinical antileukaemic activity in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent quizartinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We did an open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at 76 hospitals and cancer centres in the USA, Europe, and Canada. We enrolled patients with morphologically documented primary acute myeloid leukaemia or acute myeloid leukaemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 into two predefined, independent cohorts: patients who were aged 60 years or older with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia within 1 year after first-line therapy (cohort 1), and those who were 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory disease following salvage chemotherapy or haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (cohort 2). Patients with an FLT3-ITD allelic frequency of more than 10% were considered as FLT3-ITD positive, whereas all other patients were considered as FLT3-ITD negative. Patients received quizartinib once daily as an oral solution; the initial 17 patients received 200 mg per day but the QTcF interval was prolonged for more than 60 ms above baseline in some of these patients. Subsequently, doses were amended for all patients to 135 mg per day for men and 90 mg per day for women. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a composite complete remission (defined as complete remission + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery + complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery) and the proportion of patients who achieved a complete remission. Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of quizartinib (ie, the intention-to-treat population). Patients with a locally assessed post-treatment bone marrow aspirate or biopsy were included in efficacy analyses by response; all other patients were considered to have an unknown response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00989261, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2009-013093-41, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 19, 2009, and Oct 31, 2011, a total of 333 patients were enrolled (157 in cohort 1 and 176 in cohort 2). In cohort 1, 63 (56%) of 112 FLT3-ITD-positive patients and 16 (36%) of 44 FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieved composite complete remission, with three (3%) FLT3-ITD-positive patients and two (5%) FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieving complete remission. In cohort 2, 62 (46%) of 136 FLT3-ITD-positive patients achieved composite complete remission with five (4%) achieving complete remission, whereas 12 (30%) of 40 FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieved composite complete remission with one (3%) achieving complete remission. Across both cohorts (ie, the intention-to-treat population of 333 patients), grade 3 or worse treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (76 [23%] of 333), anaemia (75 [23%]), thrombocytopenia (39 [12%]), QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) prolongation (33 [10%]), neutropenia (31 [9%]), leucopenia (22 [7%]), decreased platelet count (20 [6%]), and pneumonia (17 [5%]). Serious adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (126 [38%] of 333; 76 treatment related), acute myeloid leukaemia progression (73 [22%]), pneumonia (40 [12%]; 14 treatment related), QTcF prolongation (33 [10%]; 32 treatment related), sepsis (25 [8%]; eight treatment related), and pyrexia (18 [5%]; nine treatment related). Notable serious adverse events occurring in less than 5% of patients were torsades de pointes (one [<1%]) and hepatic failure (two [1%]). In total, 125 (38%) of 333 patients died within the study treatment period, including the 30-day follow-up. 18 (5%) patients died because of an adverse event considered by the investigator to be treatment related (ten [6%] of 157 patients in cohort 1 and eight [5%] of 176 in cohort 2. INTERPRETATION: Single-agent quizartinib was shown to be highly active and generally well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, particularly those with FLT3-ITD mutations. These findings confirm that targeting the FLT3-ITD driver mutation with a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor is a promising clinical strategy to help improve clinical outcomes in patients with very few options. Phase 3 studies (NCT02039726; NCT02668653) will examine quizartinib at lower starting doses.

Diagnosis of HCSS is crucial for implementation of surveillance protocols. We identified children who fulfilled criteria for HCSS in Saudi Arabia using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, addressing the utility of these guidelines in a highly consanguineous population. METHODS: This multi-center cross-sectional study recruited 1858 children with cancer between January 2011 and December 2014. HCSS criteria were based on the ACMG guidelines. RESULTS: Seven hundred and four (40.4%) out of 1742 eligible patients fulfilled criteria for HCSS. Consanguinity was reported in 629 (38%) patients, with 50 (2.9%) first-degree, 535 (30.7%) second-degree, and 272 (15.6%) third-degree relatives affected with cancer. Two hundred and eighty eight (17.4%) leukemia and 87 (5.3%) brain tumour patients fulfilled HCSS criteria, with parental consanguinity being the most frequent criterion in both (leukemia 85.4%, brain tumors 83.9%). However, leukemia was less frequent in patients of consanguineous parents (p=0.023). CONCLUSION: Four out of 10 children with cancer fulfilled criteria for HCSS, most often due to consanguinity. This higher than expected prevalence suggests the need to validate consanguinity as a criterion for HCSS in highly consanguineous populations.","['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Aljefri, Abdullah', 'Ayas, Mouhab', 'Alharbi, Musa', 'Alkhayat, Nawaf', 'Al-Anzi, Faisal', 'Yassin, Fawwaz', 'Alkasim, Fawaz', 'Alharbi, Qasim', 'Abdullah, Shaker', 'Abrar, Mohammed Burhan', 'Alsultan, Abdulrahman']","['Jastaniah W', 'Aljefri A', 'Ayas M', 'Alharbi M', 'Alkhayat N', 'Al-Anzi F', 'Yassin F', 'Alkasim F', 'Alharbi Q', 'Abdullah S', 'Abrar MB', 'Alsultan A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia; Chairman Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

METHODS: The Malignant Germ Cell International Consortium (MaGIC) has created a database of the GCT clinical trials conducted since 1983 by COG (United States, Canada and Australia), which used cisplatin-based regimens, and by CCLG (United Kingdom), which used carboplatin-based regimens. Using the parametric cure model, this study compared the overall 4-year event-free survival (EFS), stratified by age, stage, site and the a-priori defined MaGIC 'risk' groups: standard risk ((SR) 1 (EFS >80%; age <11 years), SR2 (EFS >80%, age >/= 11y) and poor risk (PR) (EFS </= 70%, age >/= 11y). RESULTS: Cisplatin-based therapy was used in 620 patients; carboplatin was used in 163 patients. In the overall multivariate cure model, the two regimens did not differ significantly (cisplatin: 4-year EFS 86%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 83-89% versus carboplatin 4-year EFS 86%; 95% CI 79-90%; p = 0.87). No significant differences were noted in stratified analyses by site, stage, age and MaGIC risk groups: SR1 (p = 0.20), SR2 (p = 0.55) or PR (p = 0.72) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In these trials conducted contemporaneously, there is no significant difference in outcome observed overall, or any subset of patients, who were treated with regimens containing cisplatin versus carboplatin These results suggested sufficient equipoise to justify a randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of carboplatin versus cisplatin in the treatment of children, adolescents and young adults with standard risk GCT, which is currently underway.","['Frazier, A Lindsay', 'Stoneham, Sara', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Dang, Ha', 'Xia, Caihong', 'Olson, Thomas A', 'Murray, Matthew J', 'Amatruda, James F', 'Shaikh, Furqan', 'Pashankar, Farzana', 'Billmire, Deborah', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Stark, Dan', 'Brougham, Mark F H', 'Nicholson, James C', 'Hale, Juliet P']","['Frazier AL', 'Stoneham S', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Dang H', 'Xia C', 'Olson TA', 'Murray MJ', 'Amatruda JF', 'Shaikh F', 'Pashankar F', 'Billmire D', 'Krailo M', 'Stark D', 'Brougham MFH', 'Nicholson JC', 'Hale JP']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.

Aberrant expression of ROR1 is seen in many malignancies and has been linked to Rho-GTPase activation and cancer stem cell self-renewal. For patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), self-renewing, neoplastic B cells express ROR1 in 95% of cases. High-level leukemia cell expression of ROR1 is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We conducted a phase 1 study involving 26 patients with progressive, relapsed, or refractory CLL. Patients received four biweekly infusions, with doses ranging from 0.015 to 20 mg/kg. Cirmtuzumab had a long plasma half-life and did not have dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of ROR1 signaling was observed, including decreased activation of RhoA and HS1. Transcriptome analyses showed that therapy inhibited CLL stemness gene expression signatures in vivo.

Their high frequency suggests these mutations drive oncogenesis, yet the molecular explanation for this process is unclear. SRSF2 mutations could directly affect pre-mRNA splicing of a vital gene product; alternatively, a whole network of gene products could be affected. Here we determine how SRSF2 mutations globally affect RNA binding and splicing in vivo using HITS-CLIP. Remarkably, the majority of differential binding events do not translate into alternative splicing of exons with SRSF2(P95H) binding sites. Alternative splice alterations appear to be dominated by indirect effects. Importantly, SRSF2(P95H) targets are enriched in RNA processing and splicing genes, including several members of the hnRNP and SR families of proteins, suggesting a ""splicing-cascade"" phenotype wherein mutation of a single splicing factor leads to widespread modifications in multiple RNA processing and splicing proteins. We show that splice alteration of HNRNPA2B1, a splicing factor differentially bound and spliced by SRSF2(P95H), impairs hematopoietic differentiation in vivo. Our data suggests a model whereby the recurrent mutations in splicing factors set off a cascade of gene regulatory events that together affect hematopoiesis and drive cancer.","['Liang, Yang', 'Tebaldi, Toma', 'Rejeski, Kai', 'Joshi, Poorval', 'Stefani, Giovanni', 'Taylor, Ashley', 'Song, Yuanbin', 'Vasic, Radovan', 'Maziarz, Jamie', 'Balasubramanian, Kunthavai', 'Ardasheva, Anastasia', 'Ding, Alicia', 'Quattrone, Alessandro', 'Halene, Stephanie']","['Liang Y', 'Tebaldi T', 'Rejeski K', 'Joshi P', 'Stefani G', 'Taylor A', 'Song Y', 'Vasic R', 'Maziarz J', 'Balasubramanian K', 'Ardasheva A', 'Ding A', 'Quattrone A', 'Halene S']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, 510060, Guangzhou, China.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, 38123, Trento, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, 38123, Trento, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA.', 'Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, 38123, Trento, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06511, USA. stephanie.halene@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180601,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Exons/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/*genetics']",,,2018/06/03 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0152-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0152-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Dec;32(12):2659-2671. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0152-7.

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are novel immunotherapeutics that can redirect immune cells against AML. We now report a tetravalent (2+2) humanized BsAb in the immunoglobulin G light chain single chain fragment variable [IgG(L)-scFv] format to engage polyclonal T cells to kill CD33(+) AML targets. In vitro, this BsAb demonstrated strong antigen-specific T-cell-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (TDCC) with an 50% effective concentration (EC50) in the femtomolar range that translated into treatment of established human AML IV xenografts in vivo. Importantly, it could redirect intraperitoneally injected T cells to ablate established and rapidly growing extramedullary subcutaneous AML xenografts in vivo. Furthermore, internalization of CD33 upon BsAb binding was identical to that of a bivalent (1+1) heterodimer, both being substantially less than anti-CD33 IgG. In contrast to the heterodimer, the tetravalent IgG-scFv BsAb was >10-fold more efficient in TDCC of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. This BsAb did not react with and did not kill CD38(-)CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood. We conclude that the novel anti-CD33 IgG(L)-scFv BsAb construct reported here is a potential candidate for clinical development.","['Hoseini, Sayed Shahabuddin', 'Guo, Hongfen', 'Wu, Zhihao', 'Hatano, Miho Nakajima', 'Cheung, Nai-Kong V']","['Hoseini SS', 'Guo H', 'Wu Z', 'Hatano MN', 'Cheung NV']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['*AC133 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*pharmacology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/06/03 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/06/03 06:00'],"['2017/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017014373 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014373 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 12;2(11):1250-1258. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014373.,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)']",,PMC5998923,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9940-4571', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6323-5171']",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular p53 inhibitors like the mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) commonly suppress the p53 function in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Moreover, fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) growth factor signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) cascade (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) are highly active in AML cells. Consequently, the combined administration of MDM2 and MEK inhibitors may present a promising anti-leukemic treatment strategy. Here we assessed the MDM2 antagonist idasanutlin and the MEK1 inhibitor cobimetinib as single agents and in combination in a variety of AML cell lines and primary AML blast cells for their ability to induce apoptosis and cell death. AML cell lines and blast cells comprised all major AML subtypes based on the mutational status of TP53, FLT3 and NPM1 genes. We observed a considerably varying anti-leukemic efficacy of idasanutlin and cobimetinib. AML cells with high sensitivity to the single compounds as well as to the combined treatment emerged with normal karyotype, wild-type TP53 and elevated FLT3 and MDM2 protein levels. Our data indicate that AML cells with normal karyotype (NK) and wild-type status of TP53 with elevated FLT3 and MDM2 expression emerge to be most sensitive to the combined treatment with cobimetinib and idasanutlin. FLT3 and MDM2 are biomarkers for treatment response to idasanutlin and cobimetinib in AML.","['Seipel, Katja', 'Marques, Miguel A T', 'Sidler, Corinne', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Seipel K', 'Marques MAT', 'Sidler C', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department for Biomedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, 3008 Bern, Switzerland. katja.seipel@dbmr.unibe.ch.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Bern, 3010 Bern, Switzerland. katja.seipel@dbmr.unibe.ch.', 'Department for Biomedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, 3008 Bern, Switzerland.

However, drug treatments targeting WT MLL are lacking. We used an in vitro histone methyltransferase assay to screen a library consists of 592 FDA-approved drugs for MLL1 inhibitors by measuring alterations in HTRF signal and found that Piribedil represented a potent activity. Piribedil specifically inhibited the proliferation of MLL-r cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and myeloid differentiation with little toxicity to the non-MLL cells. Mechanism study showed Piribedil blocked the MLL1-WDR5 interaction and thus selectively reduced MLL1-dependent H3K4 methylation. Importantly, MLL1 depletion induced gene expression that was similar to that induced by Piribedil and rendered the MLL-r cells resistant to Piribedil-induced toxicity, revealing Piribedil exerted anti-leukemia effects by targeting MLL1. Furthermore, both the Piribedil treatment and MLL1 depletion sensitized the MLL-r cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

For example, targeting the canonical myeloid marker CD33 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in toxicity from destruction of normal myeloid cells. We hypothesized that a leukemia-specific antigen could be created by deleting CD33 from normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), thereby generating a hematopoietic system resistant to CD33-targeted therapy and enabling specific targeting of AML with CAR T cells. We generated CD33-deficient human HSPCs and demonstrated normal engraftment and differentiation in immunodeficient mice. Autologous CD33 KO HSPC transplantation in rhesus macaques demonstrated long-term multilineage engraftment of gene-edited cells with normal myeloid function. CD33-deficient cells were impervious to CD33-targeting CAR T cells, allowing for efficient elimination of leukemia without myelotoxicity. These studies illuminate a novel approach to antigen-specific immunotherapy by genetically engineering the host to avoid on-target, off-tumor toxicity.","['Kim, Miriam Y', 'Yu, Kyung-Rok', 'Kenderian, Saad S', 'Ruella, Marco', 'Chen, Shirley', 'Shin, Tae-Hoon', 'Aljanahi, Aisha A', 'Schreeder, Daniel', 'Klichinsky, Michael', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Kozlowski, Miroslaw S', 'Cummins, Katherine D', 'Shan, Xinhe', 'Shestov, Maksim', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Sekhri, Palak', 'Lazzarotto, Cicera R', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Kuhns, Douglas B', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Behbehani, Gregory K', 'Tsai, Shengdar Q', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Gill, Saar']","['Kim MY', 'Yu KR', 'Kenderian SS', 'Ruella M', 'Chen S', 'Shin TH', 'Aljanahi AA', 'Schreeder D', 'Klichinsky M', 'Shestova O', 'Kozlowski MS', 'Cummins KD', 'Shan X', 'Shestov M', 'Bagg A', 'Morrissette JJD', 'Sekhri P', 'Lazzarotto CR', 'Calvo KR', 'Kuhns DB', 'Donahue RE', 'Behbehani GK', 'Tsai SQ', 'Dunbar CE', 'Gill S']","['Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; Department of Chemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 20057, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Clinical Services Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21701, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) affects the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to increased vulnerability to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in ALL cells. In vitro, metformin causes ALL cell death via AMPK-mediated inhibition of the UPR. It was evaluated whether ER stress could be induced in relapsed ALL through a phase I study investigating the safety and feasibility of metformin in combination with relapse induction chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Metformin was administered twice daily for 28 days in addition to vincristine, dexamethasone, PEG-asparaginase and doxorubicin (VXLD). Dose escalation of metformin was evaluated using a 3+3 design. Pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation of the AMPK and ER stress/UPR pathways, and treatment response were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled; all were evaluable for toxicity. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was Dose level 2, 1,000 mg/m(2) /day. A single dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), hypoglycemia with acidosis, was observed at the RP2D and two DLTs, diarrhea and acidosis, were observed at Dose Level 3. Nine patients were evaluable for response as defined by the protocol, receiving at least 85% of planned metformin doses. Five complete remissions, one partial response, and one stable disease were observed. PD evaluation showed induction of ER stress, activation of AMPK, and inhibition of the UPR. CONCLUSIONS: The VXLD with metformin was tolerable with a RP2D for metformin of 1,000 mg/m(2) /day and yielded responses in a heavily pretreated population. ER stress was induced and toxicities attributable to metformin occurred in all dose levels.","['Trucco, Matteo', 'Barredo, Julio C', 'Goldberg, John', 'Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Gill, Jonathan', 'Setty, Bhuvana', 'Smith, Tiffany', 'Lush, Richard', 'Lee, Jae K', 'Reed, Damon R']","['Trucco M', 'Barredo JC', 'Goldberg J', 'Leclerc GM', 'Hale GA', 'Gill J', 'Setty B', 'Smith T', 'Lush R', 'Lee JK', 'Reed DR']","['University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.', 'UM Department of Pediatrics, Miami, FL.', 'University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.', 'UM Department of Pediatrics, Miami, FL.', 'UM Department of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'UM Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Miami, FL.', 'H3 Biomedicine Inc., St. Petersburg, FL.', 'University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.', 'UM Department of Pediatrics, Miami, FL.', ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, FL."", 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, FL."", 'Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180601,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Metformin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AMPK', '*metformin', '*pediatric', '*phase I', '*unfolded protein response']",2018/06/02 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27224 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Sep;65(9):e27224. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27224.

The aim of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of an inactivated varicella zoster vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster after auto-HSCT. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 135 medical centres (ie, stem-cell transplant centres and hospitals) in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, scheduled to receive an auto-HSCT within 60 days of enrolment, and had a history of varicella infection or were seropositive for antibodies to varicella zoster virus, or both. Exclusion criteria included a history of herpes zoster within the previous year of enrolment, and intended antiviral prophylaxis for longer than 6 months after transplantation. Participants were randomly assigned according to a central randomisation schedule generated by the trial statistician, to receive either the inactivated-virus vaccine from one of three consistency lots, a high-antigen lot, or placebo, stratified by age (<50 vs >/=50 years) and intended duration of antiviral prophylaxis after transplantation (</=3 months vs >3 to </=6 months). Participants, investigators, trial staff, and the funder's clinical and laboratory personnel were masked to group assignment. Participants were given four doses of inactivated vaccine or placebo, with the first dose 5-60 days before auto-HSCT, and the second, third, and fourth doses at about 30, 60, and 90 days after transplantation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of herpes zoster, confirmed by PCR or adjudication by a masked clinical committee, or both, assessed in all participants randomly assigned to the vaccine consistency lot group or placebo group who received at least one dose of vaccine and had auto-HSCT. Safety was assessed in all randomised participants who received at least one dose of vaccine and had follow-up data. A prespecified vaccine efficacy success criterion required the lower bound of the 95% CI be higher than 25% for the relative reduction of the hazard ratio of herpes zoster infection in participants given the vaccine from one of the consistency lots compared with those given placebo. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01229267) and EudraCT (2010-020150-34). FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2010, and April 25, 2013, 560 participants were randomly assigned to the vaccine consistency lot group, 106 to the high-antigen lot group, and 564 to the placebo group. 249 (44%) of patients in the vaccine consistency lot group, 35 (33%) in the high-antigen lot group, and 220 (39%) in the placebo group discontinued before study end, mostly because of death or withdrawal. 51 participants were excluded from the primary efficacy endpoint analyses because they did not undergo auto-HSCT or were not vaccinated, or both (22 [4%] in the vaccine consistency lot group, and 29 [5%] in the placebo group). Mean follow-up for efficacy was 2.4 years (SD 1.3) in the vaccine consistency lot group and 2.3 years (SD 1.3) in the placebo group. 42 (8%) of 538 participants in the vaccine consistency lot group (32.9 per 1000 person-years) and 113 (21%) of 535 in the placebo group (91.9 per 1000 person-years) had a confirmed case of herpes zoster. The estimated vaccine efficacy was 63.8% (95% CI 48.4-74.6), meeting the pre-specified success criterion. For the combined vaccine groups versus the placebo group, the proportion of patients with serious adverse events (216 [33%] of 657 vs 181 [33%] of 554; risk difference 0.2%, 95% CI -5.1 to 5.5) and serious vaccine-related adverse events (five [1%] vs five [1%]; risk difference 0.1%, -1.4 to 1.1) were similar. Vaccine-related injection-site adverse events occurred more frequently in participants given vaccine than those given placebo (191 [29%] vs 36 [7%]; risk difference 22.6%, 95% CI 18.5-26.6; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: This study shows for the first time in a large phase 3 trial that early vaccination of auto-HSCT recipients during the peri-transplant period can be effective for the prevention of an opportunistic infection like herpes zoster and that the vaccine is well tolerated.

But it induces limited apoptosis in cancer cells with high level of Bcl-2. The nuclear receptor PPARgamma and its agonist rosiglitazone can suppress various malignancies. More importantly, rosiglitazone is able to enhance the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy drugs such as carboplatin and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that rosiglitazone could sensitize (-)-G to induce apoptosis in cancer cells with high level of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that (-)-G increased the mRNA level and protein stability of Mcl-1, which weakened the pro-apoptotic effect of (-)-G. Rosiglitazone attenuated the (-)-G-induced Mcl-1 stability through decreasing JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, rosiglitazone upregulated dual-specificity phosphatase 16 (DUSP16), leading to a reduction of (-)-G-triggered JNK phosphorylation. Animal experiments showed that rosiglitazone could sensitize (-)-G to repress the growth of cancer cells with high level of Bcl-2 in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that the PPARgamma agonists may enhance the therapeutic effect of BH3 mimetics in cancers with high level of Bcl-2 through regulating the DUSP16/JNK/Mcl-1 singling pathway. This study may provide novel insights into the cancer therapeutics based on the combination of PPARgamma agonists and BH3 mimetics.","['Li, Xinzhe', 'He, Jintao', 'Li, Bo', 'Gao, Min', 'Zeng, Yijun', 'Lian, Jiqin', 'Shi, Chunmeng', 'Huang, Yan', 'He, Fengtian']","['Li X', 'He J', 'Li B', 'Gao M', 'Zeng Y', 'Lian J', 'Shi C', 'Huang Y', 'He F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Combined Injury, College of Preventive Medicine, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Chinese PLA 44 Hospital, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Combined Injury, College of Preventive Medicine, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Cancer Center, Daping Hospital and Research Institute of Surgery, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180612,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rosiglitazone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*(-)-gossypol', '*Bcl-2', '*Mcl-1', '*rosiglitazone', '*sensitization']",2018/06/02 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.22837 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2018 Sep;57(9):1213-1222. doi: 10.1002/mc.22837.

Dysregulation of their activity has been implicated in several types of human cancer. Patients and methods Here, in order to investigate whether GLP/G9a exerts any impact on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), GLP/G9a expression levels were assessed in a cohort of 50 patients and the effects of their inhibition were verified for the viability of CLL cells. Also, qRT-PCR was used to investigate the transcriptional levels of GLP/G9a in CLL patients. In addition, patient samples were classified according to ZAP-70 protein expression by flow cytometry and according to karyotype integrity by cytogenetics analysis. Finally, a selective small molecule inhibitor for GLP/G9a was used to ascertain whether these methyltransferases influenced the viability of MEC-1 CLL cell lineage. Results mRNA analysis revealed that CLL samples had higher levels of GLP, but not G9a, when compared to non-leukemic controls. Interestingly, patients with unfavorable cytogenetics showed higher expression levels of GLP compared to patients with favorable karyotypes. More importantly, GLP/G9a inhibition markedly induced cell death in CLL cells. Conclusion Taken together, these results indicate that GLP is associated with a worse prognosis in CLL, and that the inhibition of GLP/G9a influences CLL cell viability. Altogether, the present data demonstrate that these methyltransferases can be potential markers for disease progression, as well as a promising epigenetic target for CLL treatment and the prevention of disease evolution.","['Alves-Silva, Juliana Carvalho', 'de Carvalho, Juliana Lott', 'Rabello, Doralina Amaral', 'Serejo, Teresa Raquel Tavares', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Neves, Francisco Assis Rocha', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio Roberto', 'Pittella-Silva, Fabio', 'Saldanha-Araujo, Felipe']","['Alves-Silva JC', 'de Carvalho JL', 'Rabello DA', 'Serejo TRT', 'Rego EM', 'Neves FAR', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Pittella-Silva F', 'Saldanha-Araujo F']","['Laboratorio de Patologia Molecular do Cancer, Universidade de Brasilia, Av.

They represent a critical component of the immune suppressive niche described in cancer, where they support immune escape and tumor progression through direct effects on both the innate and adaptive immune responses, largely by contributing to maintenance of a high oxidative stress environment. The number of MDSCs positively correlates with protumoral activity, and often diminishes the effectiveness of immunotherapies, which is particularly problematic with the emergence of personalized medicine. Approaches targeting MDSCs showed promising results in preclinical studies and are under active investigation in clinical trials in combination with various immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Recently, poliovirus receptor (PVR) and poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) have been identified as novel immune checkpoints. In this investigation we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and AML patient samples highly express the T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) ligands PVR and PVRL2. Using two independent patient cohorts, we could demonstrate that high PVR and PVRL2 expression correlates with poor outcome in AML. We show for the first time that antibody blockade of PVR or PVRL2 on AML cell lines or primary AML cells or TIGIT blockade on immune cells increases the anti-leukemic effects mediated by PBMCs or purified CD3(+) cells in vitro. The cytolytic activity of the BiTE(R) antibody construct AMG 330 against leukemic cells could be further enhanced by blockade of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis. This increased immune reactivity is paralleled by augmented secretion of Granzyme B by immune cells. Employing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PVR and PVRL2 in MV4-11 cells, the cytotoxic effects of antibody blockade could be recapitulated in vitro. In NSG mice reconstituted with human T cells and transplanted with either MV4-11 PVR/PVRL2 knockout or wildtype cells, prolonged survival was observed for the knockout cells. This survival benefit could be further extended by treating the mice with AMG 330.

For both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), alloHCT provides the best chance of long-term disease-free survival for significant subsets of patients. During this interval, we have witnessed an evolution of HCT from a therapy based on high-dose conditioning to our current understanding that its success depends both on cytoreduction and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by adoptively transferred donor immune cells. Improvements in conditioning, infectious disease monitoring and management, histocompatibility testing and graft selection have successively improved outcomes, primarily due to a reduction in non-relapse mortality. Unfortunately, disease relapse remains a significant cause of treatment failure in both AML and ALL. Here, two distinguished experts, Prof. Charles Craddock and Prof. Dieter Hoelzer, reflect on the significant challenge of disease relapse following allogeneic HCT for AML and ALL, respectively. This is a review of the biology, current approaches, and future directions in the field and reflects concepts that were presented at the Third International Workshop on Biology, Prevention, and Treatment of Relapse after Stem Cell Transplantation held in Hamburg, Germany in November 2016 under the auspices of the EBMT and the ASBMT.","['Craddock, Charles', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Komanduri, Krishna V']","['Craddock C', 'Hoelzer D', 'Komanduri KV']","['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, B15 2TH, UK.

However, its molecular function in DNA damage survival is unclear. Here, we show that hst4 deficiency in the fission yeast causes S phase delay and DNA synthesis defects. We identified a novel functional link between hst4 and the replisome component mcl1 in a suppressor screen aimed to identify genes that could restore the slow growth and Methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) sensitivity phenotypes of the hst4Delta mutant. Expression of the replisome component Mcl1 rescues hst4Delta phenotypes. Interestingly, hst4 and mcl1 show an epistatic interaction and suppression of hst4Delta phenotypes by mcl1 is H3K56 acetylation dependent. Furthermore, Hst4 was found to regulate the expression of mcl1. Finally, we show that hSIRT2 depletion results in decreased levels of And-1 (human orthologue of Mcl1), establishing the conservation of this mechanism. Moreover, on induction of replication stress (MMS treatment), Mcl1 levels decrease upon Hst4 down regulation. Our results identify a novel function of Hst4 in regulation of DNA replication that is dependent on H3K56 acetylation. Both SIRT2 and And-1 are deregulated in cancers. Therefore, these findings could be of therapeutic importance in future.","['Konada, Lahiri', 'Aricthota, Shalini', 'Vadla, Raghavendra', 'Haldar, Devyani']","['Konada L', 'Aricthota S', 'Vadla R', 'Haldar D']","['Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Survey Nos. 728, 729, 730 & 734, Opposite Uppal Water Tank, Beside BSNL T E Building, Uppal, Ranga Reddy District, Hyderabad, 500039, India.', 'Graduate Studies, Manipal University, Manipal, India.', 'Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Survey Nos. 728, 729, 730 & 734, Opposite Uppal Water Tank, Beside BSNL T E Building, Uppal, Ranga Reddy District, Hyderabad, 500039, India.', 'Graduate Studies, Manipal University, Manipal, India.', 'Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Survey Nos. 728, 729, 730 & 734, Opposite Uppal Water Tank, Beside BSNL T E Building, Uppal, Ranga Reddy District, Hyderabad, 500039, India.', 'Graduate Studies, Manipal University, Manipal, India.', 'Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Survey Nos. 728, 729, 730 & 734, Opposite Uppal Water Tank, Beside BSNL T E Building, Uppal, Ranga Reddy District, Hyderabad, 500039, India. devyani@cdfd.org.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180531,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Acetylation', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Genomic Instability/*physiology', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*genetics/metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2018/06/02 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-26476-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-26476-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 May 31;8(1):8496. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-26476-4.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,PMC5981605,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1445-1374'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological cancers such as lymphoma and certain forms of leukemia are paradigmatic examples of such scenario. Recent evidence indicates that the efficacy of many of the alkylating and intercalating agents, antimetabolites, topoisomerase, and kinase inhibitors used in cancer therapy is largely due to p53 stabilization and activation consequent to the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis. In this context, innovative drugs specifically hindering ribosome biogenesis showed preclinical activity and are currently in early clinical development in hematological malignancies. The mechanism of p53 stabilization after ribosome biogenesis inhibition is a multistep process, depending on specific factors that can be altered in tumor cells, which can affect the antitumor efficacy of ribosome biogenesis inhibitors (RiBi). In the present review, the basic mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of RiBi are discussed based on the evidence deriving from available preclinical and clinical studies, with the purpose of defining when and why the treatment with drugs inhibiting ribosomal biogenesis could be highly effective in hematological malignancies.","['Derenzini, Enrico', 'Rossi, Alessandra', 'Trere, Davide']","['Derenzini E', 'Rossi A', 'Trere D']","['European Institute of Oncology, Via Ripamonti 435, 20141, Milan, Italy. enrico.derenzini@ieo.it.', 'European Institute of Oncology, Via Ripamonti 435, 20141, Milan, Italy.', 'DIMES, Universita di Bologna, Via Massarenti 9, Bologna, Italy. davide.trere@unibo.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180531,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Organelle Biogenesis', 'Ribosomes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma', '*MDM2', '*Ribosomal proteins', '*Ribosome biogenesis inhibitors', '*p53', '*pRb']",2018/06/02 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0609-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0609-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 May 31;11(1):75. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0609-1.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,PMC5984324,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7154-8140'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children who underwent allo-HSCT at our hospital from January 2014 to May 2017 due to thalassemia major, aplastic anemia, leukemia, and mucopolysaccharidosis were included. Among the children, 53 received xinruibai injections and 33 received filgrastim injections. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the average time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, the incidence of post-operative complications after allo-HSCT, the number of red blood cell and PLT infusions, or the incidence of adverse events related to the injection between two groups (P > 0.05). The pain score was 3.06 (SD 0.41) for the xinruibai group and 25.18 (SD 6.22) for the filgrastim group, indicating significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.001). No difference was found in the hospitalization cost. The cost of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was 257.11 +/- 61.87 Euro in the xinruibai group and 214.79 +/- 0.00 Euro in the filgrastim group, showing significant difference (P < 0.001).

This pathway's emergence as a rational therapeutic target in NHL led to development of BCR-directed agents, including inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K). Several drugs have become valuable assets in the anti-lymphoma armamentarium. AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview of the BCR pathway, its dysregulation in B cell NHL, and the drugs developed to target BCR signaling in lymphoma. Mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and toxicity of currently available BTK, SYK, and PI3K inhibitors are described. EXPERT OPINION: While the excellent response rates and favorable toxicity profile of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in certain NHL subtypes have propelled it to consideration as frontline therapy in selected populations, additional data and clinical studies are needed before other agents targeting BCR signaling influence clinical practice similarly. PI3K inhibitors remain an option for some relapsed indolent lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but their widespread use may be limited by adverse effects.

This patient was diagnosed several months after pediatric heart transplant, with radiographs showing evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis. Although NE does not typically affect solid organ transplant patients, this patient had a variety of risk factors that may have predisposed her to development of NE such as severe neutropenia, supratherapeutic tacrolimus level, immunosuppression with cytotoxic agents, and elevated Epstein-Barr viral load. Fortunately, this patient improved with bowel rest, fluids, antibiotics, and alteration of her immunosuppressive regimen.

A case is described in which a patient was successfully treated for AML and in whom a JAK2 V617F-positive MPN was diagnosed after seven years in remission. Retrospective evaluation of the JAK2 V617F detected a low allele burden at AML diagnosis and following one course of induction chemotherapy. This putative chemoresistant clone subsequently expanded over the intervening seven years, resulting in a hematologically overt MPN. As AML relapse has not occurred, the MPN may have arose in a separate initiating cell from that of the AML. Alternatively, both malignancies possibly evolved from a common precursor defined by a predisposition mutation with divergent evolution into MPN through acquisition of the JAK2 V617F and AML through acquisition of different mutations. This case emphasizes the protracted time frame from acquisition of a disease-driving mutation to overt MPN and further underscores the clonal complexity in MPN evolution.","['Langabeer, Stephen E', 'Haslam, Karl', 'Smyth, Maria Anne', 'Quinn, John', 'Murphy, Philip T']","['Langabeer SE', 'Haslam K', 'Smyth MA', 'Quinn J', 'Murphy PT']","[""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180509,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,2018/06/02 06:00,2018/06/02 06:01,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/8713020 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2018 May 9;2018:8713020. doi: 10.1155/2018/8713020. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5966691,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6119-158X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0042-7947']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five cases occurred as primary MS, without evidence of AML on bone marrow examination or prior history of hematologic disorders, and progressed to AML within a range of three weeks to seven months. None of these cases were started on conventional chemotherapy for AML prior to progression. Due to its rarity, primary MS of the prostate is often diagnosed incidentally, but prompt AML-targeted treatment is crucial to delaying the progression to AML.","['Nguyen, Ryan', 'Sayar, Hamid']","['Nguyen R', 'Sayar H']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180429,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,2018/06/02 06:00,2018/06/02 06:01,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/3604298 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2018 Apr 29;2018:3604298. doi: 10.1155/2018/3604298. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5949173,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8863-6649', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1047-8783']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to develop a genetic counseling format for adult Bangladeshi patients with AML. Taking this into account, a draft format was prepared by reviewing relevant documents available online which was later analyzed by an expert panel through a group discussion and thus a proposed format was developed. To make the format effective in the perspective of Bangladeshi population, the proposed format was applied in counseling, and thus a final format was developed in the English language. This format will educate the counselors, clinicians, and patients about the utility and importance of the genetic counseling and genetic tests. Also, the patients feel comfort regarding the whole counseling process and going for postcounseling treatments and advice.

Methods: PCR analysis for feline haemoplasmas was performed on surplus EDTA blood samples from 373 cats from the Belgrade region, Serbia. An ELISA was used to determine the prevalence of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and FIV; PCR was performed on a subpopulation of these cats. FIV subtyping was performed using PCR. Results: Within this population, 64/373 cats (17.2%) were infected with one or more haemoplasma species. Mycoplasma haemofelis was detected in 20/373 cats (5.4%), 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' in 47/373 cats (12.6%) and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' in 23/373 cats (6.2%). Coinfections were observed in 21/373 cats (5.6%). Based on ELISA serological retroviral testing, 4/310 cats (1.3%) were infected with FeLV, whereas 78/331 (23.6%) were infected with FIV. Multivariable analysis identified significant associations between haemoplasma infection and anaemia (anaemic/non-anaemic, odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-7.1; P = 0.041]), male gender (male/female, OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.22-9.03; P <0.0005), outdoor access (yes/no, OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.28-11.92; P <0.0005), non-pedigree breed (non-pedigree/pedigree, OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.24-24.84; P = 0.025) and FIV seropositive status (positive/negative, OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.21-4.83; P = 0.012). PCR analysis of the FIV ELISA-positive samples revealed clade D as being the most prevalent. Conclusions and relevance: All three known species of feline haemoplasma were detected, confirming their presence in Serbia; 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' was the most prevalent. We found a high prevalence of FIV-infected cats and FIV clade D was most prevalent.","['Sarvani, Elpida', 'Tasker, Severine', 'Kovac evic Filipovic, Milica', 'Francuski Andric, Jelena', 'Andric, Nenad', 'Aquino, Larissa', 'English, Sarah', 'Attipa, Charalampos', 'Leutenegger, Christian M', 'Helps, Chris R', 'Papasouliotis, Kostas']","['Sarvani E', 'Tasker S', 'Kovac evic Filipovic M', 'Francuski Andric J', 'Andric N', 'Aquino L', 'English S', 'Attipa C', 'Leutenegger CM', 'Helps CR', 'Papasouliotis K']","['Diagnostic Laboratories, Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Langford Vets and School of Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Langford, UK.', 'Diagnostic Laboratories, Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Langford Vets and School of Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Langford, UK.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department for Equine, Small Animal, Poultry and Wild Animal Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Pathology, College of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, University of Brasilia, Campus Universitario Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Diagnostic Laboratories, Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Langford Vets and School of Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Langford, UK.', 'Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane, Hatfield, UK.', 'IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Kovr Dr. West Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Diagnostic Laboratories, Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Langford Vets and School of Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Langford, UK.', 'Diagnostic Laboratories, Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Langford Vets and School of Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Langford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,,2018/06/02 06:00,2018/06/02 06:01,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116918770037 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116918770037 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2018 May 22;4(1):2055116918770037. doi: 10.1177/2055116918770037. eCollection 2018 Jan-Jun.,,,PMC5971391,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6039-6586'],,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current chemotherapy is quite toxic in growing children and more directed therapeutics are being sought. The IL-7R pathway is a major driver of ALL and here we evaluate two drugs directed to that pathway using a model of T cell ALL. Mutant gain-of-function IL-7Ralpha was transduced into an IL-7-dependent murine thymocyte line conferring ligand-independent survival and growth. JAK1 is associated with IL-7Ralpha and mediates signaling from the mutant receptor. In vitro, treating the transformed cell line with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib inhibited ligand-independent signaling and induced cell death. Transfer of the transformed cell line into mice resulted in aggressive leukemia and untreated mice succumbed in about three weeks. Treatment with ruxolitinib incorporated into chow showed a potent therapeutic benefit with reduction in leukemic burden and extension of survival.

The SKI proto-oncogene is highly upregulated in different solid tumors and leukemic cells, but little is known about its transcriptional regulation during leukemogenesis. MYB is an important hematopoietic transcription factor involved in proliferation as well as differentiation and upregulated in most human acute leukemias. Here, we find that MYB protein binds within the regulatory region of the SKI gene in AML cells. Reporter gene assays using MYB binding sites present in the SKI gene locus show MYB-dependent transcriptional activation. SiRNA-mediated depletion of MYB in leukemic cell lines reveals that MYB is crucial for SKI gene expression. Consistently, we observed a positive correlation of MYB and SKI expression in leukemic cell lines and in samples of AML patients. Moreover, MYB and SKI both were downregulated by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Strikingly, differentiation of AML cells induced by depletion of MYB is attenuated by overexpression of SKI. Our findings identify SKI as a novel MYB target gene, relevant for the MYB-induced differentiation block in leukemic cells.","['Frech, Miriam', 'Teichler, Sabine', 'Feld, Christine', 'Bouchard, Caroline', 'Berberich, Hannah', 'Sorg, Katharina', 'Mernberger, Marco', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Bauer, Uta-Maria', 'Neubauer, Andreas']","['Frech M', 'Teichler S', 'Feld C', 'Bouchard C', 'Berberich H', 'Sorg K', 'Mernberger M', 'Bullinger L', 'Bauer UM', 'Neubauer A']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT), School of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT), School of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT), School of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm 89081, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT), School of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.', 'University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg 35033, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180427,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MYB', 'SKI', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'oncogene', 'transcriptional regulation']",2018/06/02 06:00,2018/06/02 06:01,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25051 [doi]', '25051 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 27;9(32):22423-22435. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25051. eCollection 2018 Apr 27.,,,PMC5976475,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here scaled molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the conformational dynamics of these interference peptides in aqueous solution to characterise their structure and dynamics. Transitions from disordered to alpha-helical conformation, stabilised by hydrogen bonds and proline-aromatic interactions, were observed throughout the simulations. The backbone of the wild-type peptide folds to a similar conformation as that found in ternary complexes of anterior Hox proteins with conserved hexapeptide motifs important for recognition of pre-B-cell leukemia Homeobox 1, indicating that the motif may possess an intrinsic preference for helical structure. The predicted NMR chemical shifts of these peptides are consistent with the Hox hexapeptides in solution and Engrailed 2 NMR data. These findings highlight the importance of aromatic residues in determining the structure of Engrailed 1 interference peptides, shedding light on the rational design strategy of molecules that could be adopted to inhibit other transcription factors overexpressed in other cancer types, potentially including other transcription factor families that require highly conserved and cooperative protein-protein partnerships for biological activity.","['Gandhi, Neha S', 'Blancafort, Pilar', 'Mancera, Ricardo L']","['Gandhi NS', 'Blancafort P', 'Mancera RL']","['School of Mathematical Sciences and Institute for Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point Campus, Brisbane QLD 4000, Australia.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, The Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, Perth WA 6009, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute and Curtin Institute for Computation, Curtin University, Perth WA 6845, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180427,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Engrailed homeodomain', 'breast cancer', 'iPep', 'molecular dynamics', 'transcription factor']",2018/06/02 06:00,2018/06/02 06:01,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25025 [doi]', '25025 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 27;9(32):22383-22397. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25025. eCollection 2018 Apr 27.,,,PMC5976472,,,"['R01 CA170370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA036906/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify BCR-ABL1-independent genetic mediators of response to the TKI dasatinib, we performed in vivo and in vitro RNA interference (RNAi) screens in a transplantable syngeneic mouse model of BCR-ABL1(+) BCP-ALL. By using a novel combination of a longitudinal screen design and independent component analysis of screening data, we identified hairpins that have distinct behavior in different therapeutic contexts as well as in the in vivo vs in vitro settings. In the set of genes whose loss sensitized BCR-ABL1(+) BCP-ALL cells to dasatinib, we identified Pafah1b3, which regulates intracellular levels of platelet-activating factor (PAF), as an in vivo-specific mediator of therapeutic response. Pafah1b3 loss significantly sensitized leukemia cells to the multiple TKIs, indicating that inhibition of PAFAH1B3 in combination with TKI treatment may be an effective therapeutic strategy for BCR-ABL1(+) BCP-ALL patients. PAF-induced cell death as well as surface levels of PAF receptor (PAFR) in our model are altered upon dasatinib treatment and depend on the local leukemia microenvironment; the response of Pafah1b3 KO vs overexpressing cells to dasatinib is also dependent on microenvironmental context. Antagonism of the PAFR partially reverses the observed sensitization to TKI treatment upon Pafah1b3 loss in vivo, suggesting that signaling via the PAF/PAFR pathway is at least partially responsible for this effect.","['Fiedler, Eleanor R C', 'Bhutkar, Arjun', 'Lawler, Emily', 'Besada, Rana', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Fiedler ERC', 'Bhutkar A', 'Lawler E', 'Besada R', 'Hemann MT']","['The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.', 'The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",,,2018/06/02 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/06/02 06:00'],"['2017/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017015610 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015610 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 12;2(11):1229-1242. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015610.,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.1.47 (1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.47 (PAFAH1b3 protein, mouse)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,PMC5998924,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['P30 CA014051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007287/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its clinical application is limited by cardiotoxicity, such as cardiomyopathy, that once developed carries a poor prognosis and is frequently fatal. The controlled release of doxorubicin by means of a smart carrier is a strategy to overcome the aforementioned drawback. Herein, doxorubicin/keratin nanoparticles were prepared by loading the drug through ionic gelation and aggregation methods, without using cross linkers, organic solvents neither surfactants. Both methodologies afford nanoparticles with yields up to 100wt%, depending on the loading amount of doxorubicin. Although aggregation yield smaller nanoparticles ( approximately 100nm), ionic gelation allows a higher drug loading (up to 30wt%,). More importantly, nanoparticles obtained through this procedure display a pH-responsive release of the drug: indeed Peppas-Salhin model suggests that, the doxorubicin release mechanism is predominantly controlled by diffusion at pH7.4 and by protein swelling at pH5. Moreover, nanoparticles prepared by ionic gelation resulted in more efficient cell killing of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells than those prepared by aggregation. Based on the herein presented preliminary results, ionic gelation emerges as a promising approach for the preparation of keratin-based doxorubicin nanocarriers for cancer therapy, that is worth to further investigate.","['Aluigi, Annalisa', 'Ballestri, Marco', 'Guerrini, Andrea', 'Sotgiu, Giovanna', 'Ferroni, Claudia', 'Corticelli, Franco', 'Gariboldi, Marzia Bruna', 'Monti, Elena', 'Varchi, Greta']","['Aluigi A', 'Ballestri M', 'Guerrini A', 'Sotgiu G', 'Ferroni C', 'Corticelli F', 'Gariboldi MB', 'Monti E', 'Varchi G']","['Institute of Organic Synthesis and Photoreactivity - Italian National Research Council, Via P.

The experimental results of this highly sensitive and specific genosensor with clinical samples of CML positive patients and control negative patients indicate its potential for clinical diagnostics.","['Soni, Amrita', 'Pandey, Chandra Mouli', 'Solanki, Shipra', 'Kotnala, R K', 'Sumana, Gajjala']","['Soni A', 'Pandey CM', 'Solanki S', 'Kotnala RK', 'Sumana G']","['Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi 110012, India; CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi 110012, India.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Delhi Technological University, Delhi 110042, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi 110012, India; CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi 110012, India.', 'CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi 110012, India.', 'CSIR-National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi 110012, India.

In general, the physical conjugation of selected vaccine components, e.g. antigen and adjuvant, has been shown to enhance the immunogenicity and hence, can increase effectiveness of the vaccine. In our proof-of-concept study, we generated non-infectious, replication deficient Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV)-derived virus-like particles (VLPs) that physically link antigen and adjuvant in a modular fashion by co-displaying them on their surface. For this purpose, we selected the immunodominant peptides of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and the cytokine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as non-classical adjuvant. Our results show that murine GM-CSF displayed on MLV-VLPs mediates expansion and proliferation of CD11b(+) cells within murine bone marrow and total spleen cells. Moreover, we show increased immunogenicity of modular VLPs co-displaying OVA peptides and GM-CSF by their elevated capacity to induce OVA-specific T cell-activation and -proliferation within OT-I and OT-II splenocyte cultures. These enhanced effects were not achieved by using an equimolar mixture of VLPs displaying either OVA or GM-CSF. Taken together, OVA and GM-CSF co-displaying MLV-VLPs are able to target and expand antigen presenting cells which in turn results in enhanced antigen-specific T cell activation and proliferation in vitro. These data suggest MLV-VLPs to be an attractive platform to flexibly combine antigen and adjuvant for novel modular vaccination approaches.","['Gogesch, Patricia', 'Schulke, Stefan', 'Scheurer, Stephan', 'Muhlebach, Michael D', 'Waibler, Zoe']","['Gogesch P', 'Schulke S', 'Scheurer S', 'Muhlebach MD', 'Waibler Z']","['Section ""Product Testing of Immunological Biomedicines"", Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, D-63225, Langen, Germany.', 'Section Molecular Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, D-63225, Langen, Germany.', 'Section Molecular Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, D-63225, Langen, Germany.', 'Section Product Testing of IVMP, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, D-63225, Langen, Germany.

Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), the unique glycoprotein component of Lp(a), contains sequences homologous to plasminogen. Plasminogen activation is markedly accelerated in the presence of cell surface receptors and can be inhibited in this context by apo(a). METHODS: We evaluated the role of potential receptors in regulating plasminogen activation and the ability of apo(a) to mediate inhibition of plasminogen activation on vascular and monocytic/macrophage cells through knockdown (siRNA or blocking antibodies) or overexpression of various candidate receptors. Binding assays were conducted to determine apo(a) and plasminogen receptor interactions. RESULTS: The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) modulates plasminogen activation as well as plasminogen and apo(a) binding on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells, and THP-1 macrophages as determined through uPAR knockdown and overexpression. Apo(a) variants lacking either the kringle V or the strong lysine binding site in kringle IV type 10 are not able to bind to uPAR to the same extent as wild-type apo(a). Plasminogen activation is also modulated, albeit to a lower extent, through the Mac-1 (alphaMbeta2) integrin on HUVECs and THP-1 monocytes. Integrin alphaVbeta3 can regulate plasminogen activation on THP-1 monocytes and to a lesser extent on HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate cell type-specific roles for uPAR, alphaMbeta2, and alphaVbeta3 in promoting plasminogen activation and mediate the inhibitory effects of apo(a) in this process.","['Romagnuolo, Rocco', 'Scipione, Corey A', 'Bazzi, Zainab A', 'Boffa, Michael B', 'Koschinsky, Marlys L']","['Romagnuolo R', 'Scipione CA', 'Bazzi ZA', 'Boffa MB', 'Koschinsky ML']","['Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.

It has been shown that inhibition of PUMA can provide a profound benefit for the long-term survival of the mice, without an increased risk of malignancies after irradiation. It becomes to be a potential target for developing an effective treatment aimed to protect cells from lethal radiation. CLZ-8, a novel small-molecular inhibition targeting PUMA, could have considerable protection against cell apoptosis and DNA damage. The aim of the present study is to evaluate CLZ-8's radioprotective ability to enhance survival rate of mice exposed to gamma radiation, prevent radiation-induced apoptosis, and repair DNA damage in cultured cells. We have determined the best effective dose in vivo is 200mg/kg. This dose of CLZ-8 administered at 30min before radiation can notably enhance mice survival rate. CLZ-8 ameliorates radiation-induced HUVEC cells damage and reduces apoptosis counts compared to vehicle-treated cells. Western blotting analysis indicates that CLZ-8 selectively inhibits overexpressed PUMA induced by radiation. The results demonstrate that CLZ-8 ameliorates radiation-induced cell depletion, promotes DNA recovery, and protects mice from radiation injury.","['Feng, Tian', 'Liu, Jiyuan', 'Zhou, Nan', 'Wang, Libin', 'Liu, Xueying', 'Zhang, Shengyong', 'Wang, Siwang', 'Chen, Hui']","['Feng T', 'Liu J', 'Zhou N', 'Wang L', 'Liu X', 'Zhang S', 'Wang S', 'Chen H']","[""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China; Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shaanxi, China.

After relocalization from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane SHIP1 terminates PI3-kinase mediated signaling processes. Furthermore, SHIP1 is also found in distinct puncta in the cell nucleus and nuclear SHIP1 has a pro-proliferative function. Here we report the identification of five nuclear export signals (NESs) which regulate together with the two known nuclear localization signals (NLSs) the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SHIP1. Mutation of NLSs reduced the nuclear import and mutation of NESs decreased the nuclear export of SHIP1 in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line UKE-1. Interestingly, four SHIP1 mutants (K210R, N508D, V684E, Q1153L) derived from AML patients showed a nuclear accumulation after expression in UKE-1 cells. In addition, overexpression of the AML patient-derived mutation N508D caused an increased proliferation rate of UKE-1 cells in comparison to wild type SHIP1. Furthermore, we identified serine and tyrosine phosphorylation as a molecular mechanism for the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SHIP1 where tyrosine phosphorylation of distinct residues i.e. Y864, Y914, Y1021 reduces nuclear localization, whereas serine phosphorylation at S933 enhances nuclear localization of SHIP1. In summary, our data further implicate nuclear SHIP1 in cellular signaling and suggest that enhanced accumulation of SHIP1 mutants in the nucleus may be a contributory factor of abnormally high proliferation of AML cells.","['Nalaskowski, Marcus M', 'Ehm, Patrick', 'Rehbach, Christoph', 'Nelson, Nina', 'Tager, Maike', 'Modest, Kathrin', 'Jucker, Manfred']","['Nalaskowski MM', 'Ehm P', 'Rehbach C', 'Nelson N', 'Tager M', 'Modest K', 'Jucker M']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.

Currently, an effective treatment option for C481S patients exhibiting relapse to ibrutinib does not exist, and these patients have poor outcomes. To address this, we have developed a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) that induces degradation of both wild-type and C481S mutant BTK. We selected a lead PROTAC, MT-802, from several candidates on the basis of its potency to induce BTK knockdown. MT-802 recruits BTK to the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to trigger BTK ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. MT-802 binds fewer off-target kinases than ibrutinib does and retains an equivalent potency (>99% degradation at nanomolar concentrations) against wild-type and C481S BTK. In cells isolated from CLL patients with the C481S mutation, MT-802 is able to reduce the pool of active, phosphorylated BTK whereas ibrutinib cannot. Collectively, these data provide a basis for further preclinical study of BTK PROTACs as a novel strategy for treatment of C481S mutant CLL.","['Buhimschi, Alexandru D', 'Armstrong, Haley A', 'Toure, Momar', 'Jaime-Figueroa, Saul', 'Chen, Timothy L', 'Lehman, Amy M', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Crews, Craig M']","['Buhimschi AD', 'Armstrong HA', 'Toure M', 'Jaime-Figueroa S', 'Chen TL', 'Lehman AM', 'Woyach JA', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Crews CM']","['Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Center for Biostatistics , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06520-8107 , United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06520-8066 , United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180614,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Piperidines', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00391 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2018 Jul 3;57(26):3564-3575. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00391.

A 9-month-old, indoors-only, female spayed, domestic medium hair cat presented for vomiting, open-mouth breathing and acute collapse. The initial physical examination identified moderate to severe hypothermia [35 degrees C (95 degrees F)], obtunded mentation, weak femoral pulses, tachycardia (heart rate 240 beats per min), pale pink mucous membranes and significant splenomegaly on abdominal palpation. Immediate diagnostics performed [packed cell volume and total solids (PCV, TS), venous blood gas and electrolytes] revealed severe anaemia (PCV 12%), hypoproteinaemia (TS = 2.2 g/dl), and severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.956). Additional diagnostics performed included Feline Leukaemia Virus and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus testing (FeLV/FIV), complete blood count (CBC) with pathology review, serum biochemistry profile, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), urinalysis, and abdominal radiographs. Abdominal radiographs were consistent with gas within hepatic and splenic veins and parenchyma, small intestinal walls and colonic wall. Due to the guarded prognosis, euthanasia was elected. Necropsy was performed and the most significant gross and histopathological findings included intra-luminal and intra-mural intestinal haemorrhage and vascular congestion with mild neutrophilic hepatitis, and marked hepatic periportal emphysema. Clostridium perfrigens and Escherichia coli were cultured from the bowel wall; no bacterial growth from the liver or spleen was identified. This case report describes idiopathic emphysematous hepatitis, with concurrent emphysema of the spleen and intestinal wall and intestinal haemorrhage.

Their dermatological adverse event profile is poorly described. AIM: To characterize a rare cutaneous adverse event from PI3K inhibitors in order to help dermatologists and oncologists identify and effectively manage such eruptions. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients receiving PI3K inhibitors referred to the Skin Toxicities Program in The Center for Cutaneous Oncology. RESULTS: Three patients on PI3K inhibitors for treatment of malignancy developed diffuse erythroderma and keratoderma. Clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP)-like reactions. All patients improved with topical and oral corticosteroids, oral acitretin, and drug discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: PRP-like cutaneous eruptions may develop secondary to PI3K inhibition. Early dermatological evaluation of cutaneous toxicities to PI3K inhibitors as well as rapid initiation of disease-specific treatments may help keep patients on life-prolonging anti-cancer therapies.","['Dewan, A K', 'Sowerby, L', 'Jadeja, S', 'Lian, C', 'Wen, P', 'Brown, J R', 'Fisher, D C', 'LeBoeuf, N R']","['Dewan AK', 'Sowerby L', 'Jadeja S', 'Lian C', 'Wen P', 'Brown JR', 'Fisher DC', 'LeBoeuf NR']","[""Department of Dermatology, The Center for Cutaneous Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Dermatology, The Center for Cutaneous Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Center and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Dermatology, The Center for Cutaneous Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180530,England,Clin Exp Dermatol,Clinical and experimental dermatology,7606847,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodendroglioma/drug therapy', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2019/01/18 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ced.13608 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Dermatol. 2018 Dec;43(8):890-894. doi: 10.1111/ced.13608.

This is conventionally achieved through regular lumbar punctures with intrathecal injections of methotrexate into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ommaya reservoirs are subcutaneous implantable devices that provide a secure route of drug delivery into the CSF via an intraventricular catheter. They are an important alternative in cases where intrathecal injection via lumbar puncture is difficult. Among UK Paediatric Principal Treatment Centres for ALL we found considerable variation in methotrexate dosing when using an Ommaya reservoir. We review the current safety and theoretical considerations when using Ommaya reservoirs and evidence for methotrexate dose adjustments via this route. We conclude by summarising the pragmatic consensus decision to use 50% of the conventional intrathecal dose of methotrexate when it is administered via Ommaya reservoir in front-line ALL therapy.,"['Wilson, Ruairi', 'Osborne, Caroline', 'Halsey, Christina']","['Wilson R', 'Osborne C', 'Halsey C']","['School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', ""Pharmacy Department, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK."", 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. chris.halsey@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Catheters, Indwelling', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Delivery Systems/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intraventricular', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2018/09/12 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40272-018-0298-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40272-018-0298-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2018 Aug;20(4):293-301. doi: 10.1007/s40272-018-0298-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5449-5246'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ROR1 is highly upregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. NOD-scid IL2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice engrafted with human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (huNSG) achieved multilineage human immune cell reconstitution including B cells, T cells, NK cells, and DCs. Like the CLL patients, huNSG mice have abnormally high percentage of CD5-expressing B cells in the periphery. In light of this, we aim to determine whether ROR1 is expressed on huNSG B cells. Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that ROR1 was highly expressed in a proportion of bone marrow, spleen, and blood B cells, which were mostly immature B cells. Transplantation of the oncogene TCL-1-transduced CD34(+) cells in neonatal NSG mice did not increase the frequency of ROR1-expressing B cells, but the mouse with the highest engraftment of transduced cells developed a tumor-like lump consisting of a high percentage of ROR1-expressing B cells. This study highlights the potential use of huNSG mice to study B cell malignant diseases and to evaluate immunotherapeutics targeting ROR1.","['Leung, Carol S']",['Leung CS'],"['Department of Hematology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180418,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/2480931 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2018 Apr 18;2018:2480931. doi: 10.1155/2018/2480931. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",,PMC5932492,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1545-7228'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown that in patients with acute leukemia given haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, donor-derived NK cells play a key role in the eradication of cancer cells. The antileukemic effect is mostly related to the presence of ""alloreactive"" NK cells, that is, mature KIR+ NK cells that express inhibitory KIR mismatched with HLA class I (KIR-L) of the patient. A genotypic analysis detecting KIR B haplotype and the relative B content is an additional donor selection criterion. These data provided the rationale for implementing phase I/II clinical trials of adoptive infusion of either selected or ex vivo-activated NK cells, often from an HLA-mismatched donor. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on the role played by NK cells in patients with acute leukemia, focusing also on the various approaches to adoptive NK cell therapy and the unresolved issues therein. In addition, we outline new methods to enhance NK activity, including anti-KIR monoclonal antibody, bi-/trispecific antibodies linking NK cells to cytokines and/or target antigens, and CAR-engineered NK cells.","['Mavers, Melissa', 'Bertaina, Alice']","['Mavers M', 'Bertaina A']","['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, Stanford Children's Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA."", 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu' Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180415,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia/*immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, KIR/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/1586905 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2018 Apr 15;2018:1586905. doi: 10.1155/2018/1586905. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",,PMC5925205,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5452-9530', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3729-436X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early treatment with the anti-viral drug, acyclovir, is life-saving. In view of the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms associated with HSV hepatitis, diagnosis is often made late during the course of the disease; a factor that largely contributes to the high mortality rate of this treatable disease complication. There is thus a growing consensus in the field to initiate empirical treatment with acyclovir once suspicion of HSV hepatitis is raised even before reaching a conclusive diagnosis. Presentation of case: We present clinical evidence on the benefit of starting empirical acyclovir treatment on the outcome of patients suffering from HSV hepatitis. We report two cases of HSV hepatitis in children with cancer. One case presented with fulminant hepatitis which was fatal and the diagnosis was only reached post mortem. In the second case, there was enough suspicion of HSV hepatitis to start early empirical acyclovir therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed 48hours following the initiation of treatment and the early intervention with anti-virals proved to be life-saving. Discussion: In both cases above, the following symptoms were shared; fever, elevated transaminase levels and mucositis without clear cutaneous lesions. HSV hepatitis should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of immuonocomprimised patients exhibiting the above symptoms. Conclusion: Due to the frequent delay in HSV diagnosis and the safety of acyclovir, we recommend empirically administering acyclovir in patients suspected of HSV hepatitis.","['Faqih, Nesreen A', 'Alfaqih, Mahmoud A', 'Salami, Khadra', 'Herron, Brian', 'Sultan, Iyad', 'Al-Hussaini, Maysa']","['Faqih NA', 'Alfaqih MA', 'Salami K', 'Herron B', 'Sultan I', 'Al-Hussaini M']","['Departments of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Queen Rania Street, Amman, Jordan.', 'Department of Physiology Biochemistry, Jordan University of Science Technology, Irbid, Jordan.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Queen Rania Street, Amman, Jordan.', 'Department of Pathology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Queen Rania Street, Amman, Jordan.', 'Departments of Pathology, King Hussein Cancer Center, Queen Rania Street, Amman, Jordan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Case Reports']",20180221,Netherlands,IDCases,IDCases,101634540,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Acyclovir', '*Empirical treatment', '*Hepatitis', '*Herpes simplex virus']",2018/06/01 06:00,2018/06/01 06:01,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.idcr.2018.02.006 [doi]', 'S2214-2509(17)30252-4 [pii]']",epublish,IDCases. 2018 Feb 21;12:10-12. doi: 10.1016/j.idcr.2018.02.006. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5966627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, assessing the drug resistance and especially the drug resistance genes of leukemic cells is important in any treatment. The impact of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and hypoxic condition have been observed in the biological performance of majority of leukemic cells. Methods: MOLT-4 cells were co-cultured with MSCs in the hypoxic condition induced by Cobalt Chloride (CoCl2) for 6 and 24 hr. Then, apoptosis of cells was analyzed using annexin-V/PI staining and expression of the drug resistance genes including MDR1, MRP, and BCRP along with apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, including BAX and BCL2, was evaluated by real-time PCR. Results: The hypoxic condition for MOLT-4 cells co-cultured with MSCs could significantly increase the expression of MDR1 and BCRP genes (p<0.05) which are involved in drug resistance. Also, the results indicated that this condition significantly increases the expression of BCL2 (p<0.05) and reduces the apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells co-cultured with MSCs in the hypoxic condition. Conclusion: These effects can demonstrate the important role of hypoxia and MSCs on the biological behavior of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cells that may lead to particular treatment outcomes.","['Baharaghdam, Sina', 'Yousefi, Mehdi', 'Movasaghpour, Aliakbar', 'Solali, Saeed', 'Talebi, Mehdi', 'Ahani-Nahayati, Milad', 'Lotfimehr, Hamid', 'Shamsasanjan, Karim']","['Baharaghdam S', 'Yousefi M', 'Movasaghpour A', 'Solali S', 'Talebi M', 'Ahani-Nahayati M', 'Lotfimehr H', 'Shamsasanjan K']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology,101511065,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'Hypoxia', 'Mesenchymal stem cell']",2018/06/01 06:00,2018/06/01 06:01,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/01 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol. 2018 Apr-Jun;10(2):62-68.,,,PMC5960061,,,,,"['Conflict of Interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest', 'regarding the publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plasma samples for the nontargeted metabolite profiling analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were taken when fever rose over 38 degrees and on the next morning. Results: Altogether, 90 differential molecular features were shown to explain the differences between patients with complicated (bacteremia, severe sepsis, or fatal outcome) and noncomplicated courses of febrile neutropenia. The most differential compounds were an androgen hormone, citrulline, and phosphatidylethanolamine PE(18:0/20:4). The clinical relevance of the findings was evaluated by comparing them with conventional biomarkers like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Conclusion: These results hold promise to find out novel biomarkers for febrile neutropenia, including citrulline.

Bcl-extra large (xL)/myeloid cell leukemia sequence (Mcl)-1 was demonstrated to be expressed at relatively high levels in clinically aggressive basal-like cancers and inhibiting Bcl-xL overexpression could potentially provoke cell death. A molecule able to target Bcl-xL/Mcl-1, JY-1-106, is herein under investigation. It is also known that vitamin A-derived compounds exhibit antitumor activity in a variety of in vitro experimental models, promoting their effects via nuclear receptor isoforms including retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Pre-clinical observation highlighted that triple negative (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor)-breast cancer cells displayed resistance to retinoids due to the RARgamma high expression profile. The present study used the triple-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, to analyze the effects of the Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 synthetic inhibitor, JY-1-106, alone or in combination with retinoids on cell viability. The results revealed a synergistic effect in reducing cell viability primarily by using JY-1-106 with the selective RARgamma antagonist SR11253, which induces massive autophagy and necrosis. Furthermore, the results highlighted that JY-1-106 alone is able to positively influence the gene expression profile of p53 and RARalpha, providing a therapeutic advantage in human triple-negative breast cancer treatment.","['Perri, Mariarita', 'Yap, Jeremy L', 'Fletcher, Steven', 'Cione, Erika', 'Kane, Maureen A']","['Perri M', 'Yap JL', 'Fletcher S', 'Cione E', 'Kane MA']","['Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, Ed.

In this strategy, the T cell genome is modified by integration of viral vectors or transposons encoding chimaeric antigen receptors (CARs) that direct tumour cell killing. However, this approach is often limited by the extent of expansion and persistence of CAR T cells(4,5). Here we report mechanistic insights from studies of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with CAR T cells targeting the CD19 protein. Following infusion of CAR T cells, anti-tumour activity was evident in the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and bone marrow; this activity was accompanied by complete remission. Unexpectedly, at the peak of the response, 94% of CAR T cells originated from a single clone in which lentiviral vector-mediated insertion of the CAR transgene disrupted the methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 gene. Further analysis revealed a hypomorphic mutation in this patient's second TET2 allele. TET2-disrupted CAR T cells exhibited an epigenetic profile consistent with altered T cell differentiation and, at the peak of expansion, displayed a central memory phenotype. Experimental knockdown of TET2 recapitulated the potency-enhancing effect of TET2 dysfunction in this patient's CAR T cells. These findings suggest that the progeny of a single CAR T cell induced leukaemia remission and that TET2 modification may be useful for improving immunotherapies.","['Fraietta, Joseph A', 'Nobles,

However, targeting ROR1 with small-molecules has been challenging due to the absence of ROR1 kinase activity. To identify genes that regulate ROR1 expression and may, therefore, serve as surrogate drug targets, we employed an siRNA screening approach and determined that the epigenetic regulator and E3 ubiquitin ligase, UHRF1, is required for t(1;19) pre-B-ALL cell viability in a ROR1-dependent manner. Upon UHRF1 silencing, ROR1 protein is reduced without altering ROR1 mRNA, and ectopically expressed UHRF1 is sufficient to increase ROR1 levels. Additionally, proteasome inhibition rescues loss of ROR1 protein after UHRF1 silencing, suggesting a role for the proteasome in the UHRF1-ROR1 axis. Finally, we show that ROR1-positive cells are twice as sensitive to the UHRF1-targeting drug, naphthazarin, and undergo increased apoptosis compared to ROR1-negative cells. Naphthazarin elicits reduced expression of UHRF1 and ROR1, and combination of naphthazarin with inhibitors of pre-B cell receptor signaling results in further reduction of cell survival compared with either inhibitor alone. Therefore, our work reveals a mechanism by which UHRF1 stabilizes ROR1, suggesting a potential targeting strategy to inhibit ROR1 in t(1;19) pre-B-ALL and other malignancies.","['Chow, Marilynn', 'Gao, Lina', 'MacManiman, Jason D', 'Bicocca, Vincent T', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Alumkal, Joshi J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W']","['Chow M', 'Gao L', 'MacManiman JD', 'Bicocca VT', 'Chang BH', 'Alumkal JJ', 'Tyner JW']","['Department of Cell, Developmental, and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA."", 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA. tynerj@ohsu.edu.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA. tynerj@ohsu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA. tynerj@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180530,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Naphthoquinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0299-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0299-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Sep;37(38):5221-5232. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0299-8.

Recently, we designed, synthesized, and identified the Ru(II)-thymine complex [Ru(PPh(3))(2)(Thy)(bipy)]PF(6) (where PPh = triphenylphosphine, Thy = thymine and bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a potent cytotoxic agent with the ability to bind to DNA and human and bovine serum albumins. In this study, the underlying cytotoxic mechanism of the [Ru(PPh(3))(2)(Thy)(bipy)]PF(6) complex was assessed. This complex displayed potent cytotoxicity in different cancer cell lines; the morphology that is associated with apoptotic cell death, increased internucleosomal DNA fragmentation without cell membrane permeability, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increased phosphatidylserine externalization, and caspase-3 activation were observed in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that were treated with the complex. Moreover, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, partially reduced the apoptosis that was induced by the complex, indicating that the apoptotic cell death occurred through a caspase-mediated pathway. In conclusion, the [Ru(PPh(3))(2)(Thy)(bipy)]PF(6) complex displays potent cytotoxicity to different cancer cells and induces caspase-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['de Souza Oliveira, Maiara', 'de Santana, Adila Angelica Dantas', 'Correa, Rodrigo S', 'Soares, Milena Botelho Pereira', 'Batista, Alzir Azevedo', 'Bezerra, Daniel Pereira']","['de Souza Oliveira M', 'de Santana AAD', 'Correa RS', 'Soares MBP', 'Batista AA', 'Bezerra DP']","['Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, Salvador 40296-710, Bahia, Brazil. msoliveira87@hotmail.com.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, Salvador 40296-710, Bahia, Brazil. dantas.adila@gmail.com.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto 35400-000, Minas Gerais, Brazil. rodrigoquimic@gmail.com.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, Salvador 40296-710, Bahia, Brazil. milenabpsoares@gmail.com.', 'Center of Biotechnology and Cell Therapy, Hospital Sao Rafael, Salvador 41253-190, Bahia, Brazil. milenabpsoares@gmail.com.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos 13561-901, Sao Paulo, Brazil. daab@ufscar.br.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, Salvador 40296-710, Bahia, Brazil. danielpbezerra@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180530,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Ruthenium Compounds/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thymine/*chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60', 'apoptosis', 'cytotoxicity', 'ruthenium', 'thymine']",2018/06/01 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2018/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19061609 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19061609 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 May 30;19(6). pii: ijms19061609. doi: 10.3390/ijms19061609.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ruthenium Compounds)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)']",,PMC6032384,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6774-2063'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case reports.,128-137,S0003469X18028166 [pii],"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cancer in the world, susceptible to potentially curative liver resection (LR) in selected cases. Centrally located HCC (CL-HCC) are sited in central liver segments and may require complex LR because of their relationship to major vascular and biliary structures and deep parenchymal location. Even though extended segment-oriented resections are recommended for oncological reasons, more conservative LR may be indicated in patients with cirrhosis to preserve an adequate function of the future remnant liver (FRL). To extend the indication to LR and to increase the safety of the surgical procedure, preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) or sequential transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (TAE/TACE) and PVE have been widely used, to induce atrophy of the embolized segments involved by the tumor and compensatory hypertrophy of the FLR. The most appropriate surgical strategy for small uninodular CL-HCC remains controversial, and should be decided according to the features of the tumor at preoperative imaging, the relationship with major intrahepatic vessels and the expected function of the FRL. We report here two cases of elderly cirrhotic patients with unifocal small CL-HCC, where the surgical strategy was decided according to the kind of relationship of the tumor with the hepatic hilum at preoperative imaging. In the first case there was no clear evidence of neoplastic infiltration of the hilar vessels, so that a minor conservative LR was preferred. In the second patient the tumor was suspected to infiltrate the right portal vein, and a major LR was performed after sequential TACE/PVE.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Of the 1363 patients seen with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and other IgM-secreting B cell lymphoproliferative disorders seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1996 and 2015, 57 kidney biopsies were retrospectively studied. The biopsy findings were correlated with clinical, kidney, and hematologic characteristics. Criteria for inclusion were evidence of a monoclonal IgM protein and availability of a kidney and a bone marrow biopsy for review. Glomerular and tubulointerstitial pathologies were categorized according to whether they were related to the monoclonal IgM. RESULTS: Of the 57 patients identified, monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney lesions were identified in 82% (47 of 57 biopsies), whereas nonmonoclonal gammopathy-related kidney lesions were seen in 18% (ten of 57). Monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney lesions included monoclonal Ig-related amyloidosis (n=19; 33%), nonamyloid glomerulopathy (n=20, 35%), and tubulointerstitial nephropathies (n=8; 14%). The most common monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney lesion was monoclonal Ig-related amyloidosis (n=19; 33%) followed by cryoglobulinemic GN (n=13; 28%). Lymphoma infiltration was the most common tubulointerstitial lesion (n=4; 9%). The hematologic diagnosis was Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in 74% (n=42), monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance in 16% (n=9), and marginal zone lymphoma (n=2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=2), and low-grade B cell lymphoma (n=2) in 4% each.

Transfusion dependence (TD) may hinder or delay enrollment, because hospice organizations typically disallow transfusions. We examined the association between TD and end-of-life outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries with leukemia. From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we selected beneficiaries with acute and chronic leukemias who died in 2001-2011. We defined TD as >/=2 transfusions within 30 days before death or hospice enrollment. End points included hospice enrollment and length of stay, reporting relative risk (RR) adjusted for key covariates. Among 21 033 patients with a median age of 79 years, 20% were transfusion dependent before death/hospice enrollment. Use of hospice increased from 35% in 2001 to 49% in 2011. Median time on hospice was 9 days and was shorter for transfusion-dependent patients (6 vs 11 days; P < .001). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, TD was associated with a higher use of hospice services (RR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.12) but also with 51% shorter hospice length of stay (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.44-0.54). Hospice enrollees had a lower likelihood of inpatient death and chemotherapy use and lower median Medicare spending at end-of-life, regardless of TD status. In conclusion, relatively increased hospice use combined with a markedly shorter length of stay among transfusion-dependent patients suggests that they have a high and incompletely met need for hospice services and that they experience a barrier to timely referral. Policy solutions supporting palliative transfusions may maximize the benefits of hospice for leukemia patients.","['LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'Egan, Pamela C', 'Olszewski, Adam J']","['LeBlanc TW', 'Egan PC', 'Olszewski AJ']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Medicine, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI.', 'Department of Medicine, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI; and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180530,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Chronic Disease', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', '*Hospice Care', 'Humans', '*Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', '*Quality of Health Care']",,,2018/06/01 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/06/01 06:00'],"['2018/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31983-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-03-842575 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Aug 16;132(7):717-726. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-03-842575.

To identify potent therapeutic targets with the ability to block multiple cancer-driving pathways is thus imperative. The unique peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1 has been reported to promote tumorigenesis through upregulation of numerous cancer-driving pathways. Although Pin1 is a key drug target for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) caused by a fusion oncogene, much less is known about the role of Pin1 in other heterogeneous leukemia. METHODS: The mRNA and protein levels of Pin1 were detected in samples from de novo leukemia patients and healthy controls using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The establishment of the lentiviral stable-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system and the tetracycline-inducible shRNA system for targeting Pin1 were used to analyze the biological function of Pin1 in AML cells. The expression of cancer-related Pin1 downstream oncoproteins in shPin1 (Pin1 knockdown) and Pin1 inhibitor all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treated leukemia cells were examined by western blot, followed by evaluating the effects of genetic and chemical inhibition of Pin1 in leukemia cells on transformed phenotype, including cell proliferation and colony formation ability, using trypan blue, cell counting assay, and colony formation assay in vitro, as well as the tumorigenesis ability using in vivo xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: First, we found that the expression of Pin1 mRNA and protein was significantly increased in both de novo leukemia clinical samples and multiple leukemia cell lines, compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, genetic or chemical inhibition of Pin1 in human multiple leukemia cell lines potently inhibited multiple Pin1 substrate oncoproteins and effectively suppressed leukemia cell proliferation and colony formation ability in cell culture models in vitro. Moreover, tetracycline-inducible Pin1 knockdown and slow-releasing ATRA potently inhibited tumorigenicity of U937 and HL-60 leukemia cells in xenograft mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Pin1 is highly overexpressed in human AML and is a promising therapeutic target to block multiple cancer-driving pathways in AML.","['Lian, Xiaolan', 'Lin, Yu-Min',

The CAR T cell therapy is nevertheless associated with toxicities, especially if the CARs are not entirely tumor-specific. Therefore, strategies for controlling the CAR T cell activity are required to improve their safety profile. Here, by using the multiple myeloma (MM)-associated CD38 molecule as target molecule, we tested the feasibility and utility of a doxycycline (DOX) inducible Tet-on CD38-CAR design to control the off-target toxicities of CAR T cells. Using CARs with high affinity to CD38, we demonstrate that this strategy allows the proper induction of CD38-CARs and CAR-mediated T cell cytotoxicity in a DOX-dose dependent manner. Especially when the DOX dose was limited to 10ng/ml, its removal resulted in a relatively rapid decay of CAR- related off-tumor effects within 24 hours, indicating the active controllability of undesired CAR activity. This Tet-on CAR design also allowed us to induce the maximal anti-MM cytotoxic activity of affinity-optimized CD38-CAR T cells, which already display a low toxicity profile, hereby adding a second level of safety to these cells. Collectively, these results indicate the possibility to utilize this DOX inducible CAR-design to actively regulate the CAR-mediated activities of therapeutic T cells. We therefore conclude that the Tet-on system may be more advantageous above suicide-genes to control the potential toxicities of CAR T cells without the need to destroy them permanently.","['Drent, Esther', 'Poels, Renee', 'Mulders, Manon J', 'van de Donk, Niels W C J', 'Themeli, Maria', 'Lokhorst, Henk M', 'Mutis, Tuna']","['Drent E', 'Poels R', 'Mulders MJ', 'van de Donk NWCJ', 'Themeli M', 'Lokhorst HM', 'Mutis T']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180530,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197349 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-40674 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 30;13(5):e0197349. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197349. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,PMC5976165,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0140-9708'],,,,"['Tuna Mutis, Henk Lokhorst and Niels van de Donk received project grant support', 'from Genmab, Janssen and Celgene.

Unmanipulated haploidentical-related donor transplantation based on a myeloablative conditioning regimen (HAPLO-MAC) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) as prophylaxis against graft vs host disease (GvHD) is now a promising rescue strategy that could become universally available. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of HAPLO-MAC with PT-Cy in patients with AL and MDS reported to the Haploidentical Transplantation Subcommittee of the Spanish Group for Hematopoietic Transplantation (GETH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our multicenter experience using an IV busulfan-based HAPLO-MAC regimen and PT-Cy for treatment of 65 adults with high-risk AL and MDS. RESULTS: Engraftment was recorded in 64 patients (98.5%), with a median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery of 16 and 27 days, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD was 28.6% and 27.5%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 31 months for survivors, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse at 2 years was 18.8% and 25%, respectively. Estimated 30-month event-free survival and overall survival were 56% and 54.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: HAPLO-MAC comprising an IV busulfan-based conditioning regimen enabled long-term disease control with acceptable toxicity in high-risk AL and MDS.","['Gayoso, Jorge', 'Balsalobre, Pascual', 'Kwon, Mi', 'Herrera, Pilar', 'Bermudez, Arancha', 'Sampol, Antonia', 'Jimenez, Santiago', 'Lopez-Corral, Lucia', 'Serrano, David', 'Pinana, Jose Luis', 'Pascual, Maria J', 'Heras, Inmaculada', 'Bento, Leyre', 'Varela, Rosario', 'Humala, Karem', 'Zabalza, Amaya', 'Laiglesia, Almudena', 'Bastos-Oreiro, Mariana', 'Perez-Corral, Ana', 'Martinez-Laperche, Carolina', 'Buno, Ismael', 'Diez-Martin, Jose L']","['Gayoso J', 'Balsalobre P', 'Kwon M', 'Herrera P', 'Bermudez A', 'Sampol A', 'Jimenez S', 'Lopez-Corral L', 'Serrano D', 'Pinana JL', 'Pascual MJ', 'Heras I', 'Bento L', 'Varela R', 'Humala K', 'Zabalza A', 'Laiglesia A', 'Bastos-Oreiro M', 'Perez-Corral A', 'Martinez-Laperche C', 'Buno I', 'Diez-Martin JL']","['Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Doctor Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Regional Universitario, Malaga, Spain.', 'HGU Morales Meseguer, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de A Coruna, A Coruna, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina Universidad Complutense, HGU Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180803,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'haploidentical transplantation', 'myeloablative conditioning', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'post-transplant cyclophosphamide']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13103 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Sep;101(3):332-339. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13103.

Extensively established key effectors of such apoptotic bypass mechanisms, the antiapoptotic BCL-2 (apoptosis regulator BCL-2) proteins, determine the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. Within this background, research and development of antiapoptotic BCL-2 inhibitors were considered to have a tremendous amount of potential toward the discovery of novel pharmacological modulators in cancer. In this review, milestone achievements in the development of selective antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins inhibitors for BCL-2, BCL-XL (BCL-2-like protein 1), and MCL-1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL-1) were summarized and their future implications were discussed. In the first section, the design and development of BCL-2/BCL-XL dual inhibitor navitoclax, as well as the recent advances and clinical experience with selective BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, were synopsized. Preclinical data from selective BCL-XL inhibitors, which are currently undergoing extensive testing as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents, were further summarized. In the second section, MCL-1 inhibitors developed as potential anticancer agents were reviewed regarding their specificity toward MCL-1. Explicitly, studies leading to the identification of MCL-1, nonselective and selective targeting of MCL-1, and recently initiated clinical trials were compiled in chronological order. Based on these concepts, future directions were further discussed for increasing selectivity in the design of prosurvival BCL-2 member inhibitors.","['Timucin, Ahmet Can', 'Basaga, Huveyda', 'Kutuk, Ozgur']","['Timucin AC', 'Basaga H', 'Kutuk O']","['Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Uskudar University, Uskudar, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Molecular Biology, Genetics and Bioengineering Program, Sabanci University, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Molecular Biology, Genetics and Bioengineering Program, Sabanci University, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Adana Medical and Research Center, School of Medicine, Baskent University, Yuregir, Adana, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180530,United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins', '*cancer', '*small molecules', '*targeted therapy']",2018/05/31 06:00,2019/02/20 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/med.21516 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2019 Jan;39(1):146-175. doi: 10.1002/med.21516.

We analyzed data from 339 patients with CML who were extracted from the CML Cooperative Study Group database. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated to assess the risk of SMs using data from the Cancer Registries in Japan. The median follow-up was 65 months. SMs developed in 14 patients (4.1%, 10 men, 4 women) after the start of TKIs. The median age was 69 years at the time of the CML diagnosis and 72.5 years at the time of the SM diagnosis. Ten patients were treated with imatinib, three with dasatinib, and one with nilotinib as the initial treatment. The SIR for all malignancies was 1.05 (95% CI 0.50-1.93) for men and 1.08 (95% CI 0.29-2.76) for women. The difference in the overall survival (OS) of patients with or without SMs was not statistically significant (5-year OS: 82.5% vs. 92.9%; p = 0.343). A subgroup analysis of 166 patients treated with second-generation TKIs (92 dasatinib, 74 nilotinib) showed that the SIRs for all malignancies were 1.33 (95% CI 0.36-3.41) for men and 0 for women.

There was no evidence of an increase in the incidence of SMs during second-generation TKI treatment.

METHODS: B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells of 2 different donors were exposed to ambient conditions. Samples were taken at different days and measured with MFI, FlowCAM, hemocytometry and automated cell counting. Dead and live cells from a fresh B-ALL cell suspension were fractionated by flow cytometry in order to derive software filters based on morphological parameters of separate cell populations with MFI and FlowCAM. The filter sets were used to assess cell viability in the measured samples. RESULTS: All techniques gave fairly similar cell concentration values over the whole incubation period. MFI showed to be superior with respect to precision, whereas FlowCAM provided particle images with a higher resolution. Moreover, both FIM methods were able to provide similar results for cell viability as the conventional methods (hemocytometry and automated cell counting). CONCLUSION: FIM-based methods may be advantageous over conventional cell methods for determining total cell concentration and cell viability, as FIM measures much larger sample volumes, does not require labeling, is less laborious and provides images of individual cells.","['Sediq, A S', 'Klem, R', 'Nejadnik, M R', 'Meij, P', 'Jiskoot, Wim']","['Sediq AS', 'Klem R', 'Nejadnik MR', 'Meij P', 'Jiskoot W']","['Division of BioTherapeutics, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Division of BioTherapeutics, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Division of BioTherapeutics, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Division of BioTherapeutics, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands. w.jiskoot@lacdr.leidenuniv.nl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180530,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,IM,"['Cell Count/*instrumentation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Microscopy/instrumentation', 'Optical Imaging/*instrumentation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['FlowCAM', 'cell based medicinal product', 'cell viability', 'hemocytometry', 'micro-flow imaging', 'particle analysis']",2018/05/31 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11095-018-2422-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11095-018-2422-5 [pii]']",epublish,Pharm Res. 2018 May 30;35(8):150. doi: 10.1007/s11095-018-2422-5.,,,PMC5976703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies in adult oncology patients have suggested a potential negative association between VTE and survival, but this association has not been examined in pediatric patients yet. The aim of this study was to assess the association of VTE with survival in pediatric oncology patients. Data from all pediatric oncology patients treated at the two tertiary care centers in Atlantic Canada were pooled to create a population-based cohort. The association between VTE and survival was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by diagnosis group (leukemia, lymphoma, and other; sarcoma) and adjusted for age at diagnosis and sex. Out of 939 patients included in this study, 73 had a VTE (8%) and 131 (14%) patients died during the study period. Children in the leukemia/lymphoma/other group with a VTE had significantly poorer survival relative to children in the same group who did not have a VTE. Although children with sarcoma and VTE had poorer survival compared to children with sarcoma with no VTE, this association was not statistically significant. In this population-based study, we found a negative association between VTE and survival in pediatric oncology patients. If future studies confirm this association, this finding may have prognostic implications and potentially offer new avenues for the management of pediatric patients with cancer.","['Forbrigger, Zara', 'Kuhle, Stefan', 'Brown, Mary Margaret', 'Moorehead, Paul C', 'Digout, Carol', 'Kulkarni, Ketan']","['Forbrigger Z', 'Kuhle S', 'Brown MM', 'Moorehead PC', 'Digout C', 'Kulkarni K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, IWK Health Centre, 5850/5980 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Perinatal Epidemiology Research Unit, Departments of Pediatrics and Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Perinatal Epidemiology Research Unit, Departments of Pediatrics and Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Janeway Pediatric Research Unit, Janeway Children's Health and Rehabilitation Centre, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, IWK Health Centre, 5850/5980 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, IWK Health Centre, 5850/5980 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, B3K 6R8, Canada. ketan.kulkarni@iwk.nshealth.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180530,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sarcoma/mortality', 'Tertiary Care Centers/statistics & numerical data', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric oncology', 'Population-based', 'Survival', 'Venous thromboembolism']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/08/24 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3371-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3371-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Oct;97(10):1903-1908. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3371-0.

Recent studies have provided a clearer understanding of the mechanisms whereby blast-derived exosomes act to suppress hematopoiesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RECENT FINDINGS: Exosomes released from leukemia blasts have been shown to suppress hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) functions indirectly through stromal reprogramming of niche-retention factors and also as a consequence of AML exosome-directed microRNA delivery to HPC. Furthermore, exosomes secreted by AML blasts remodel the bone marrow niche into a leukemia growth-permissive microenvironment. SUMMARY: Exosomes suppress hematopoiesis in AML. Strategies to block the production, secretion and reprogramming that exosomes induce may be a novel therapeutic approach in AML and other leukemias.","['Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Whiteside, Theresa L']","['Boyiadzis M', 'Whiteside TL']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Departments of Medicine.', 'Pathology, Immunology and Otolaryngology, University of Pittsburgh, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Exosomes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2019/03/08 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000439 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Jul;25(4):279-284. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000439.,,,,,,"['R21 CA205644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA168628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) and the third-generation TKI, ponatinib, have added opportunities but also complexity in the settings of CML treatment. AREAS COVERED: Different definitions of intolerance have been used through several clinical trials, making the published data non homogenous. In most cases, only the severity of acute adverse events (AEs), graded by conventional scales such as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, was reported. Limited attention to long-term events or more in general, to the impact of AEs on patient quality of life (QoL), remains a problem. Ponatinib is active against all BCR-ABL1 mutants, including T315I, and is widely used to treat patients who developed resistance to other TKIs in any CML phase; however, only limited data is available on the possible role of ponatinib for intolerant patients. EXPERT OPINION: We review the different definitions of intolerance used in sponsored trials and in clinical practice, and we discuss how such definitions impact on the management of AEs. We summarize how to evaluate QoL during treatment with TKIs and how to include ponatinib among possible option for intolerant patients.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Minotti, Giorgio']","['Breccia M', 'Efficace F', 'Iurlo A', 'Luciano L', 'Abruzzese E', 'Gozzini A', 'Pregno P', 'Tiribelli M', 'Rosti G', 'Minotti G']","[""a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Policlinico Umberto 1, 'Sapienza' University , Rome , Italy."", 'b GIMEMA data center.', ""c Hematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda - Maggiore Policlinico Hospital Foundation , University of Milan , Milan , Italy."", ""d Hematology , Federico II' University of Naples , Naples , Italy."", 'e Hematology , S.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the endometrial stromal cells were isolated enzymatically and mechanically, and cultured to the fourth passage. Next, their immunophenotype was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis as mesenchymal stromal cells. The cells were cultured as either the experimental group in the presence of E2 (0.3 nmol) and P4 (63.5 nmol) or control group without any hormone treatment. Mouse blastocysts were co-cultured with endometrial mesenchymal stromal cells in both groups for 48 hours. Their interaction was assessed under an inverted microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Expressions of alphaV and beta3 integrins, LIFR, and IL-1R genes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Similar observations were seen in both groups by light microscopy and SEM. We observed the presence of pinopode-like structures and cell secretions on the apical surfaces of endometrial mesenchymal stromal cells in both groups. The trophoblastic cells expanded and interacted with the mesenchymal monolayer cells. At the molecular level, expression of IL-1R significantly increased in the hormonal treated group compared to the control (P</=0.05). Expressions of the other genes did not differ. Conclusion: This study has shown that co-culture of endometrial mesenchymal stromal cells with mouse embryo in media that contained E2 (0.3 nmol) and P4 (63.5 nmol) could effectively increase the expression of IL-1R, which is involved in embryo implantation. However, there were no significant effects on expressions of alphaV and beta3 integrins, LIFR, and on the morphology and ultrastructure of endometrial mesenchymal stromal cells.","['Rahimipour, Marzieh', 'Salehnia, Mojdeh', 'Jafarabadi, Mina']","['Rahimipour M', 'Salehnia M', 'Jafarabadi M']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Reproductive Health Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The soluble version of the construct self-organizes as regular 11 nm planar entities that are highly cytotoxic in cultured CXCR4(+) cancer cells upon short time exposure, with a determined IC50 in the nanomolar order of magnitude. The chemical inhibition of CXCR4 binding sites in exposed cells results in a dramatic reduction of the cytotoxic potency, proving the receptor-dependent mechanism of cytotoxicity. The insoluble version of T22-mRTA-H6 is, contrarily, moderately active, indicating that free, nanostructured protein is the optimal drug form. In animal models of acute myeloid leukemia, T22-mRTA-H6 nanoparticles show an impressive and highly selective therapeutic effect, dramatically reducing the leukemia cells affectation of clinically relevant organs. Functionalized T22-mRTA-H6 nanoparticles are then promising prototypes of chemically homogeneous, highly potent antitumor nanostructured toxins for precise oncotherapies based on self-mediated intracellular drug delivery.","['Diaz, Raquel', 'Pallares, Victor', 'Cano-Garrido, Olivia', 'Serna, Naroa', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Laura', 'Falgas, Aida', 'Pesarrodona, Mireia', 'Unzueta, Ugutz', 'Sanchez-Chardi, Alejandro', 'Sanchez, Julieta M', 'Casanova, Isolda', 'Vazquez, Esther', 'Mangues, Ramon', 'Villaverde, Antonio']","['Diaz R', 'Pallares V', 'Cano-Garrido O', 'Serna N', 'Sanchez-Garcia L', 'Falgas A', 'Pesarrodona M', 'Unzueta U', 'Sanchez-Chardi A', 'Sanchez JM', 'Casanova I', 'Vazquez E', 'Mangues R', 'Villaverde A']","['Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB-Sant Pau) and Josep Carreras Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, 08025, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB-Sant Pau) and Josep Carreras Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, 08025, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB-Sant Pau) and Josep Carreras Research Institute, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, 08025, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Servei de Microscopia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, 08193, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas y Tecnologicas (IIBYT) (CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Cordoba), ICTA and Catedra de Quimica Biologica, Departamento de Quimica, FCEFyN, UNC, Av.

Here, we document a significant inverse correlation between the function of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CTL (Tax-CTL), as assessed by ex vivo cytokine production in response to cognate peptide, and the HTLV-1 provirus load in PBMC in both HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC) (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [Rs] = -0.494, P = .037, n = 18) and ATL patients (Rs = -0.774, P = .001, n = 15). There was also a significant correlation between the HTLV-1 provirus load and the percentage of PD-1-positive Tax-CTL in both HTLV-1 AC (Rs = 0.574, P = .013) and ATL patients (Rs = 0.676, P = .006). Furthermore, the percentage of PD-1-positive Tax-CTL was inversely correlated with their function in HTLV-1 AC (Rs = -0.542, P = .020), and ATL patients (Rs = -0.639, P = .010). These findings indicate that the function of Tax-CTL decreased as their programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) levels increased, parallel to the increased HTLV-1 provirus load in PBMC. We propose that functional Tax-CTL are crucial for determining the HTLV-1 provirus load in PBMC, not only in HTLV-1 AC, but also in ATL, and that PD-1 expression levels are reliable markers of Tax-CTL function. Thus, modulating the immunological equilibrium between Tax-CTL and HTLV-1-infected cells to achieve dominance of functional effectors could represent an ideal strategy for controlling HTLV-1-associated disease.","['Masaki, Ayako', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Narita, Tomoko', 'Kinoshita, Shiori', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Iida, Shinsuke']","['Masaki A', 'Ishida T', 'Suzuki S', 'Ito A', 'Narita T', 'Kinoshita S', 'Ri M', 'Kusumoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Inagaki H', 'Ueda R', 'Iida S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180627,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['CTL', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'programmed cell death protein 1']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13654 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Aug;109(8):2383-2390. doi: 10.1111/cas.13654.

However, patients receiving dasatinib frequently require dose reductions and treatment interruptions (treatment alteration). METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the frequency and significance of treatment alteration during dasatinib therapy in patients with CML. In all patients, trough plasma concentrations of dasatinib (Cmin) at steady state were assessed on day 28 of therapy. RESULTS: 28% of patients had their doses reduced at a median of 42 days, and 25% of patients had temporarily interrupted at a median of 54 days after treatment initiation. The overall dasatinib treatment alteration-free rate at 1 year was 66%. Age was significantly correlated with Cmin on day 28 (p = 0.014), and the correlation remained significant after adjusting dasatinib dose (g), body weight (kg) (Cmin/D/W) (p = 0.026). In the univariate analysis, deep molecular response, advanced PS, higher Cmin/D/W were associated with a significantly higher risk of treatment alteration (HR 4.19, 95% CI: 1.06-16.60, p = 0.041; HR 5.26, 95% CI: 1.33-20.80, p = 0.018; and HR 10.15, 95% CI: 2.55-40.48, p = 0.001, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, advanced PS and higher Cmin/D/W were correlated with the incidence of treatment alteration (HR 4.78, 95% CI: 1.01-22.70, p = 0.049; HR 6.17, 95% CI: 1.17-32.50, respectively). CONCLUSION: Current data demonstrate that patients treated with dasatinib who displayed a high Cmin/D/W value and/or advanced PS were at a high risk for altered treatment.","['Mizuta, Shuichi', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi', 'Matsumoto, Kana', 'Miyao, Kotaro', 'Hara, Takeshi', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Sakemura, Reona', 'Kojima, Hiroshi', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Oba, Mari S', 'Morita, Satoshi', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Emi, Nobuhiko']","['Mizuta S', 'Sawa M', 'Tsurumi H', 'Matsumoto K', 'Miyao K', 'Hara T', 'Takahashi T', 'Sakemura R', 'Kojima H', 'Kohno A', 'Oba MS', 'Morita S', 'Sakamoto J', 'Emi N']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan. mizuta@spacelan.ne.jp.', 'Hematology and Immunology, Kanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Daigaku, Uchinada, Kahoku-gun, Ishikawa, 920-0293, Japan. mizuta@spacelan.ne.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', ""Department of Clinical Pharmaceutics, Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts, Kyoto, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Gifu Municipal Hospital, Gifu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Daido Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, JA Aichi Konan Kosei Hospital, Konan, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Statistics, Faculty of Medicine, Toho University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Tokai Central Hospital, Kagamigahara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180529,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Individualized dasatinib therapy', 'Plasma concentration', 'Treatment adherence']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/11/09 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-018-1300-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-018-1300-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2018 Oct;23(5):980-988. doi: 10.1007/s10147-018-1300-9.

In quantitative evaluation of response to ATRA treatment, lymphocytes must be excluded as they do not originally have t(15;17). We categorized peripheral blood leukocytes by nuclear morphology into polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) comprising segmented granulocytes, and non-polymorphonuclear cells (NPMs) which includes lymphocytes, monocytes, band cells, and immature myeloid cells. We consecutively evaluated the ratio of t(15;17)-positive cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization in eight newly diagnosed patients with APL. We confirmed the differentiation of APL cells until cytogenetic complete remission; the association of a decrease of t(15;17)-positive NPMs and an increase of t(15;17)-positive PMNs was followed by a decrease of t(15;17)-positive PMNs. The kinetic pattern of t(15;17)-positive NPMs and PMNs was consistent in most patients, irrespective of leukocyte counts at diagnosis, additional chromosomal changes, and ATRA with or without chemotherapies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received 0.16 mg/kg ATO per day. ATO was given for 40 min infusion on the first day followed by 18-20 h daily at a very slow rate with infusion speed of 8 drips/min. During the first week, plasma samples were collected immediately before next administration on each day, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 h after administration, at the end of infusion (18 h) on day 7. Total arsenic was determined by ICPMS. Arsenic species, arsenious acid (As(III)) and its metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)), were quantified by UHPLC-ICPMS. Safety assessment and PK analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Hyperleukocytosis occurred in two patients and no severe toxicity was observed. Total arsenic gradually accumulated from 15.84 to 34.12 ng/mL during the first week of therapy. MMA(V)/iAs increased and remained stable at value about 0.6 after day 4, while DMA(V)/MMA(V) declined under 2 after day 4. Compared with 2 h infusion, clearance (CL) of As(III) was significantly lower (0.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.7 L/kg/h, P = 0.002) while AUC0-t of As(III) was significantly increased (213.9 +/- 38.6 vs. 82.6 +/- 55.7 L/kg/h, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Continuous slow-rate ATO infusion provided an alternative administration for ATO therapy with few toxic effects. Degree of methylation from MMA to DMA is inconsistent with that from iAs to MMA. PK of arsenic species is considered important for clinical use of ATO.","['Gao, Chunlu', 'Hu, Shuang', 'Guo, Meihua', 'Hai, Xin', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Gao C', 'Hu S', 'Guo M', 'Hai X', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Pharmacy, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, China. hai_xin@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, China. zj_hmu@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180529,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*Arsenic metabolite', '*Arsenic trioxide', '*High-performance liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass', 'spectrometry', '*Pharmacokinetics', '*Slow-rate infusion']",2018/05/31 06:00,2019/08/02 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-018-3606-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-018-3606-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2018 Aug;82(2):229-236. doi: 10.1007/s00280-018-3606-8.

However, the function of miR135a in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely unknown. In the present study, it was demonstrated that miR135a expression was significantly downregulated in AML cells compared with normal control cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of miR135a in patients with AML predicted poor prognosis. Through functional experiments, overexpression of miR135a was demonstrated to significantly inhibit the proliferation and cell cycle of AML cells, while it promoted cellular apoptosis. miR135a directly targeted HOXA10 in AML cells. miR135a overexpression significantly suppressed the mRNA and protein levels of HOXA10 in AML cells. Moreover, there was an inverse association between miR135a expression and HOXA10 level in AML samples. Additionally, by ectopic expression of HOXA10, restoration of HOXA10 significantly abolished the effects of miR135a overexpression on AML cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR135a serves as a tumor suppressor in AML by targeting HOXA10, and miR135a may be a promising prognostic biomarker for AML patients.","['Xu, Hongwei', 'Wen, Quan']","['Xu H', 'Wen Q']","['Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150086, P.R.

The pathogenesis of AD is primarily associated with hyperactivated mast cells, which makes them an effective treatment target. After crosslinking the antigen/immunoglobulin (Ig) E complex binds to its high affinity receptor FcepsilonRl on the surface of mast cells. The cells subsequently secrete excessive proinflammatory mediators, including histamine and cytokines, which lead to pruritus and immune cell infiltration in the skin lesions. The present study screened natural compounds that have an inhibitory effect on IgE/antigenmediated secretory activity. It was revealed that cryptotanshinone (CRT), a natural compound extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, had inhibitory effects on the IgE/antigen complex. The underlying mechanism by which CRT exerted an antiallergy/inflammatory function was investigated using rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells for degranulation assays and a 1chloro2,4dinitrobenzene (DNCB)induced AD Balb/c mouse model for in vivo study. CRT effectively mitigated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factoralpha and interleukin 1beta, as well as immune cell infiltration into skin lesions in a mouse model of ADlike skin disease induced by dinitrochlorobenzene. The inhibitory effect of CRT on IgEmediated mast cell degranulation was mediated by the inhibition of tyrosine kinasedependent degranulation signalling pathways involving spleen tyrosine kinase and Lyn. The present study revealed CRT as an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation. Therefore, CRT may be considered for development as a therapeutic drug to treat IgEmediated skin diseases.","['Buyanravjikh, Sumiyasuren', 'Han, Sora', 'Lee, Sunyi', 'Jeong, Ae Lee', 'Ka, Hye In', 'Park, Ji Young', 'Boldbaatar, Ariundavaa', 'Lim, Jong-Seok', 'Lee, Myeong-Sok', 'Yang, Young']","['Buyanravjikh S', 'Han S', 'Lee S', 'Jeong AL', 'Ka HI', 'Park JY', 'Boldbaatar A', 'Lim JS', 'Lee MS', 'Yang Y']","[""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Biological Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/chemically induced/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Syk Kinase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/mmr.2018.9042 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2018 Jul;18(1):1095-1103. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9042.

However, their curative potential appears limited, probably as a consequence of TKI-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that persist as a result of aberrant pathways independent of the well-established oncoprotein Bcr-Abl. One such pathway involves signaling through leukotrienes (LTs), bioactive compounds that have been suggested to play a role in several other malignancies. Cysteinyl LT1 receptor (CysLT1R) has been reported to be overexpressed in a number of solid cancers, and blocking of this receptor with the antagonist montelukast (treatment approved for bronchial asthma) has resulted in the killing of cancer cells. We recently demonstrated that montelukast, alone or in combination with imatinib, can effectively reduce the growth of CML cells, while normal bone marrow cells were left unaffected. Herein, we further investigated the importance of CysLT1R for the survival of CML cells and the mechanisms by which montelukast induces cell death. Knockdown of the CysLT1R of K562 cells with siRNA reduced their growth by 25%. Montelukast had no effect on these cells, while it killed more than 50% of CysLT1R-expressing cells. Growth inhibition exerted by imatinib was unaffected by CysLT1R status. Montelukast-induced killing of K562/JURL-MK1 CML cells was paralleled by Bax overexpression, cytochrome c release, PARP-1 cleavage, and caspase-3 activation, an event further increased in a setting where montelukast was added to imatinib.

However, the role of 9(11)DHEP toward the malignant melanoma cells has not been investigated. In the present study, the steroid from Ganoderma lucidum was purified on a submerged culture, and its antitumor mechanisms on A375 human malignant melanoma cells was investigated by MTT, flow cytometry and western blotting. The studies demonstrated that apoptotic mechanisms of the steroid were caspasedependent and mediated via the mitochondrial pathway. The steroid did not cause significant changes in the expression levels of Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family proteins, Bcl2like protein 11, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis, Bcl2associated X protein, BH3 interactingdomain death agonist, Bcl2associated death promoter and Bcl2, but it significantly downregulated induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl1 (Mcl1) in melanoma cells, suggesting the key role of Mcl1 in regulating apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by the steroid. These properties of 9(11)DHEP advocate its usage as supplements in human malignant melanoma chemoprevention. The present study also suggests that mycelium of G. lucidum has a potential for producing bioactive substances and extracts with applications in medicine.","['Zheng, Lin', 'Wong, Yum-Shing', 'Shao, Mumin', 'Huang, Shiying', 'Wang, Fochang', 'Chen, Jianping']","['Zheng L', 'Wong YS', 'Shao M', 'Huang S', 'Wang F', 'Chen J']","['Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Hospital Chinese Medicine Preparation, Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518033, P.R.

Accordingly, we analyzed the cost of treatment and utility of children treated with two protocols in Iran. Methods: The entire medical direct costs of patients in ""BFM ALL"" protocol and ""UK ALL"" protocol in multi-centers calculated from Apr 2010 to Jun 2015. For calculating utility and Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) of the patients, we used standard questionnaire Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3). The patients and their parents were interviewed. Data were analyzed using software SPSS18 and EXCEL. Results: The average direct medical cost for each patient for BFM-ALL was 15026 USD and UK-ALL was 8282 USD which showed a significant difference in the total cost of the treatment in the two protocols (P</=0.02). Finally, there was a significant difference in the utility score of the maintenance phase of these two methods (P</=0.003). Conclusion: UK-ALL is dominant and BFM protocol is dominated by both sides total costs and utility and QALY. Mainly, more hospital stay in ""BFM ALL"" protocol is the cause of raised costs in this protocol. Consequently, by considering different QALYs in the methods and low costs in ""UK ALL"" protocol, ""UK ALL"" protocol is more preferred.","['Hayati, Hadi', 'Kebriaeezadeh, Abbas', 'Ehsani, Mohammad Ali', 'Nikfar, Shekoufeh', 'Akbari Sari, Ali', 'Mehrvar, Azim', 'Shahgholi, Elham']","['Hayati H', 'Kebriaeezadeh A', 'Ehsani MA', 'Nikfar S', 'Akbari Sari A', 'Mehrvar A', 'Shahgholi E']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pharmacoeconomics and Pharmaceutical Administration, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pharmacoeconomics and Pharmaceutical Administration, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bahrami Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pharmacoeconomics and Pharmaceutical Administration, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Health Management and Economics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MAHAK Pediatric Cancer Treatment and Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bahrami Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Public Health,Iranian journal of public health,7505531,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'BFM-ALL', 'Children', 'Cost-utility', 'UK-ALL']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/05/31 06:01,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Public Health. 2018 Mar;47(3):407-412.,,,PMC5971178,,,,,['Conflict of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known concerning its function in cell invasion and migration. In the present study, cell migration and invasion assays revealed that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein induced migration and invasion without affecting cell proliferation in the BCap37 breast cancer cell line. In addition, it was found that the overexpression of Bcl-2 in BCap37 cells increased metastasis to the lung in a mouse model. Using western blotting and RT q-PCR analysis, it was demonstrated that the overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, whereas it increased the levels of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. Therefore, the results suggested that Bcl-2 may induce cellular metastasis in breast cancer via the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.","['Du, Chengyong', 'Zhang, Xiaochen', 'Yao, Minya', 'Lv, Kezhen', 'Wang, Jiannan', 'Chen, Luyan', 'Chen, Yaomin', 'Wang, Shuqian', 'Fu, Peifen']","['Du C', 'Zhang X', 'Yao M', 'Lv K', 'Wang J', 'Chen L', 'Chen Y', 'Wang S', 'Fu P']","['Department of Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, P.R.

In bone marrow samples of AML patients, PDIA3 expression was higher than that in the samples of healthy controls. We aimed at exploring the effect of PDIA3 siRNA on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of AML HL-60 and HEL cells. Materials and methods: RT-PCR was performed to identify PDIA3 expression. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT. Flow cytometry analysis and transwell were used to detect cell apoptosis, migration and invasion. Gene set enrich-ment analysis (GSEA) was employed to explore the PDIA 3-associated pathways in AML. Western blotting was used for protein expression detection. Results: PDIA3 siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of AML cells at 24 and 48 h. PDIA3 siRNA notably enhanced the percentage of apoptotic cells. The migration and invasion abilities of HL-60 and HEL cells in the PDIA3 siRNA group were significantly suppressed compared with those in the control and siNC groups. GSEA of the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes oxidative phosphorylation and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways could be correlated with PDIA3 expression; this was further confirmed in AML cells by Western blotting. MAPK signaling was also blocked by PDIA3 siRNA. Conclusion: PDIA3 siRNA effectively enhanced apoptosis, and suppressed proliferation, invasion, and migration of AML cells by regulating oxidative phosphorylation and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways, and MAPK signaling, which can provide novel therapeutic targets for AML.","['Ye, Qidong', 'Fu, Pan', 'Dou, Jiaying', 'Wang, Nina']","['Ye Q', 'Fu P', 'Dou J', 'Wang N']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo Hospital of Zhejiang University, Ningbo, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180517,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MAPK pathway', 'PDIA3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene set enrichment analysis', 'invasion', 'migration']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/05/31 06:01,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S162407 [doi]', 'ott-11-2925 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 May 17;11:2925-2935. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S162407. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5961636,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the roles of circRNAs in the development and treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Here we report the expression profiling and function of circRNAs in APL, including their dynamic regulation during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation. We performed two independent ribosomal RNA-minus RNA-sequencing (Ribo-minus RNA-seq) experiments with and without RNase R treatment on APL patient-derived NB4 cells and identified a total of 4313 circRNAs, including 1098 newly identified circRNAs. Detailed analysis showed that circRNAs expressed in APL cells were mostly exon-derived, not by-products during splicing, and could be distinguished from hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes. The true presence and stability of circRNAs were verified both in NB4 cells and primary APL patient samples. Moreover, we conducted a time-series analysis of circRNAs on ATRA-treated NB4 cells and uncovered 508 circRNAs with dynamic expression during ATRA treatment, including 246 upregulated and 262 downregulated. Further evidence demonstrated that the majority of circRNAs were regulated independently of their host linear mRNAs. Detailed functional experiments demonstrated that circ-HIPK2, one of the differentially expressed circRNAs, significantly influenced ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that circ-HIPK2 was located in cytoplasm and served as a sponge for differentiation-associated miR-124-3p. Finally, circ-HIPK2 expression in APL patients was significantly lower than that in normal peripheral mononuclear cells and other subtypes of AML, indicating its potential role as an APL biomarker. Our study indicates the biological functions of circRNAs in the development and treatment of APL, and provides a comprehensive circRNA resource for future studies.","['Li, Shufen', 'Ma, Yunlin', 'Tan, Yun', 'Ma, Xuefei', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Chen, Bing', 'Zhang, Rongsheng', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Wang, Kankan']","['Li S', 'Ma Y', 'Tan Y', 'Ma X', 'Zhao M', 'Chen B', 'Zhang R', 'Chen Z', 'Wang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. kankanwang@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. kankanwang@shsmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180529,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genome, Human', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Circular/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0699-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0699-2 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 May 29;9(6):651. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0699-2.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN124 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,PMC5973936,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of leukemia cells to MC-3129 led to the inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis through the dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin. A mechanistic study revealed that interruption of the RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the MC-3129-mediated dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and induction of apoptosis. Our in vivo study also showed that the MC-3129-mediated inhibition of the tumor growth in a mouse leukemia xenograft model is associated with the interruption of ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling and apoptosis. Molecular docking suggested that MC-3129 might activate the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway by targeting LPAR2. Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model, in which the induction of apoptosis by MC-3129 primarily results from the activation of RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN and inactivation of PI3K/Akt, leading to the dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of cofilin, and culminating in cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Our study reveals a novel role for RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling in the regulation of mitochondrial translocation of cofilin and apoptosis and suggests MC-3129 as a potential drug for the treatment of human leukemia.","['Zheng, Yi', 'Ouyang, Qin', 'Fu, Ruoqiu', 'Liu, Lei', 'Zhang, Hongwei', 'Hu, Xiaoye', 'Liu, Yanxia', 'Chen, Yingchun', 'Gao, Ning']","['Zheng Y', 'Ouyang Q', 'Fu R', 'Liu L', 'Zhang H', 'Hu X', 'Liu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Gao N']","['College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China. ycchen@scu.edu.cn.', 'College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, 400038, Chongqing, China. gaoning59@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180529,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Actin Depolymerizing Factors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclohexenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'rho-Associated Kinases/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2018/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0689-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0689-4 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 May 29;9(6):656. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0689-4.,"['0 (Actin Depolymerizing Factors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",,PMC5974298,,,"['81402202/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81402013/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JMML and CMML transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in about 10% and 50% of patients, respectively. However, how additional events cooperate with Ras to promote this transformation are largely unknown. We show that absence of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22), a component of the Spt-Ada-GCN5-acetyltransferase chromatin-remodeling complex that is linked to cancer progression, unexpectedly promotes AML transformation in mice expressing oncogenic Kras(G12D/+) USP22 deficiency in Kras(G12D/+) mice resulted in shorter survival compared with control mice. This was due to a block in myeloid cell differentiation leading to the generation of AML. This effect was cell autonomous because mice transplanted with USP22-deficient Kras(G12D/+) cells developed an aggressive disease and died rapidly. The transcriptome profile of USP22-deficient Kras(G12D/+) progenitors resembled leukemic stem cells and was highly correlated with genes associated with poor prognosis in AML. We show that USP22 functions as a PU.1 deubiquitylase by positively regulating its protein stability and promoting the expression of PU.1 target genes. Reconstitution of PU.1 overexpression in USP22-deficient Kras(G12D/+) progenitors rescued their differentiation. Our findings uncovered an unexpected role for USP22 in Ras-induced leukemogenesis and provide further insights into the function of USP22 in carcinogenesis.","['Melo-Cardenas, Johanna', 'Xu, Yuanming', 'Wei, Juncheng', 'Tan, Can', 'Kong, Sinyi', 'Gao, Beixue', 'Montauti, Elena', 'Kirsammer, Gina', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Yu, Jindan', 'Ji, Peng', 'Crispino, John D', 'Fang, Deyu']","['Melo-Cardenas J', 'Xu Y', 'Wei J', 'Tan C', 'Kong S', 'Gao B', 'Montauti E', 'Kirsammer G', 'Licht JD', 'Yu J', 'Ji P', 'Crispino JD', 'Fang D']","['Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; and.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; and.', 'Department of Pathology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180529,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32044-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-811760 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Jul 26;132(4):423-434. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-811760.

However, there is little information about the role of miR-4497 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). The aim of this study is to investigate the role of miR-4497 in LSCC. METHODS: MiR-4497 expression in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues was measured by RT-PCR. The effects of miR-4497 on cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by the MTT assay, Flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assay. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of various proteins. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay were applied to investigate the relationship between miR-4497 and GBX2. RESULTS: We found that miR-4497 expression was downregulated in LSCC tumor tissues and cell lines compared to the normal counterparts. Overexpression of miR-4497 inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of LSCC cells accompanied by the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Mechanisms investigation revealed that GBX2 is a direct target of miR-4497. miR-4497 expression was inversely correlated with GBX2 expression in LSCC tissues. Moreover, overexpression of miR-4497 leads to the activation of ERK, JNK but not p38. Inhibition of ERK by specific inhibitor SCH772984 could interfere the apoptosis induced by overexpression of miR-4497. CONCLUSION: Therefore, our results indicate that miR-4497 may play a suppressive role in LSCC by targeting GBX2, which offer new insights into the tumorigenesis of LSCC.","['Chen, Xudong', 'Zhang, Litao', 'Tang, Shixiong']","['Chen X', 'Zhang L', 'Tang S']","[""Department of Otolaryngology, The First Hospital of Ningbo, Ningbo, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Otolaryngology, The First Hospital of Ningbo, Ningbo, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Otolaryngology, The First Hospital of Ningbo, Ningbo, People's Republic of China.

However, several major issues impeding the efficient delivery of these drugs for APL therapy remain unsolved. The low solubility of retinoic acid in physiological solutions makes drug delivery cumbersome, and the high systemic cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide leads to unwanted side effects. In the present study, a new organo-arsenic molecule was synthesized via template-directed ring-opening esterification of an epoxy arsenic hydride (2-chloro-1,3,2-dioxaarsolane, CDA) under a nucleophilic attack exposing the hydroxyl terminus. The additional single step conjugation with retinoic acid (RA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) yielded the amphiphilic prodrug PEG-As-RA that readily self-assembles into nanoparticles in the aqueous phase. The assembled nanoparticles containing both arsenic and RA exhibit high water solubility and good biocompatibility.

GERSHWIN is an open-label, single-arm, phase Ib study of obinutuzumab monotherapy in Chinese patients with histologically documented CD20(+) relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or follicular lymphoma (FL). The primary outcome measure of pharmacokinetics has been previously reported. We now present data on the secondary endpoint measures (e.g., safety, and efficacy and pharmacodynamics). METHODS: Patients received 1000 mg obinutuzumab intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 (CLL patients; first dose split over 2 days), and on day 1 of cycles 2-8. Each cycle lasted for 21 days; the treatment period was 24 weeks. All subjects receiving at least one dose of obinutuzumab were included in the analysis of safety, efficacy, as well as pharmacodynamics. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients (> 18 years of age) were enrolled (CLL: 12; DLBCL: 23; FL: 13). The subjects received a median of two lines of anticancer treatment prior to the enrollment. Thirty-five patients (72.9%) had at least one adverse event (AE). The most frequent AE was infusion-related reactions (15 patients; 31.3%), followed by pyrexia (11 patients; 22.9%). Treatment-related AEs were reported in 28 patients (58.3%), and included one death (interstitial lung disease). End-of-treatment (EoT) response rate was 33.3%. Best overall response rate was 47.9%. Most CLL patients achieved a partial response at EoT (58.3%). CD19(+) depletion occurred in 75.0% of the patients with CLL, and all patients with FL and DLBCL. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab monotherapy in Chinese patients with B-cell lymphomas were similar to that observed in previous studies in non-Chinese patients; no new safety signals were observed.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid a fatal outcome. However, very limited reports have focused on HLH during chemotherapy (Ch-HLH) due to a low incidence and insufficient knowledge. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old male was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations and pulmonary infection. He received IA regimen (Idarubicin, 8 mg/m2/d for 3 days and cytarabine, 100 mg/m2/d for 7 days) chemotherapy, anti-infection drugs and blood components transfusions. During the stage of bone marrow suppression, he presented with a fever, cytopenia (WBC, 0.43 x 10(9)/L; Hb, 73 g/L and PLT, 1 x 10(9)/L), refractory coagulation dysfunction (APTT, 104.0 s; PT, 30.5 s and Fbg, 0.87 g/L), splenomegaly (3 cm below the costal margin), hyperferritinemia (SF > 3000 mug/L), increased soluble interleukin-II receptors (sIL-2R > 7500 u/mL) and haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow and was diagnosed with HLH. After he was treated with methylprednisolone at 500 mg/d for 3 days, 120 mg/d for 3 days and 80 mg/d for 3 days, followed by a gradually reduced dose combined with powerful anti-infection drugs, his symptoms subsided and his abnormal parameters recovered to normal levels. CONCLUSION: Patients with HLH in acute leukemia have a high rate of mortality. This case report provides helpful clinical experiences relative to the recognition and treatment of Ch-HLH for clinicians.","['Li, Fei', 'Zhang, Xiaojie', 'Wang, Yunyun', 'Yang, Ailin', 'Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Tang, Weiping', 'Zhong, Nan', 'Shi, Huidong']","['Li F', 'Zhang X', 'Wang Y', 'Yang A', 'Zhang Z', 'Tang W', 'Zhong N', 'Shi H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China. yx021021@sina.com.', 'Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Molecular Diagnosis and Precision Medicine, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China. yx021021@sina.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17 Yongwai Zheng Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Medical College, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330006, China.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180529,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/blood/*chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Mutation', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute monocytic leukemia', 'DNMT3A', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis', 'Malignancy']",2018/05/31 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4534-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4534-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 May 29;18(1):604. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4534-z.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,PMC5975417,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7765-5975'],,"['81360353/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81560034/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81560036/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '20142BAB205072/the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi province', '20153BCB23040/Young Scientist Training Program of Jiangxi Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification and implementation of genomic regions controlling umbilical hernia in breeding is of great interest to reduce incidences of hernia in commercial pig production. The aim of this study was to identify such regions and possibly identify causative variation affecting umbilical hernia in pigs. A case/control material consisting of 739 Norwegian Landrace pigs was collected and applied in a GWAS study with a genome-wide distributed panel of 60 K SNPs. Additionally candidate genes were sequenced to detect additional polymorphisms that were used for single SNP and haplotype association analyses in 453 of the pigs. RESULTS: The GWAS in this report detected a highly significant region affecting umbilical hernia around 50 Mb on SSC14 (P < 0.0001) explaining up to 8.6% of the phenotypic variance of the trait. The region is rather broad and includes 62 significant SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with each other. Targeted sequencing of candidate genes within the region revealed polymorphisms within the Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Oncostatin M (OSM) that were significantly associated with umbilical hernia (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A highly significant QTL for umbilical hernia in Norwegian Landrace pigs was detected around 50 Mb on SSC14. Resequencing of candidate genes within the region revealed SNPs within LIF and OSM highly associated with the trait. However, because of extended LD within the region, studies in other populations and functional studies are needed to determine whether these variants are causal or not. Still without this knowledge, SNPs within the region can be used as genetic markers to reduce incidences of umbilical hernia in Norwegian Landrace pigs.","['Grindflek, Eli', 'Hansen, Marianne H S', 'Lien, Sigbjorn', 'van Son, Maren']","['Grindflek E', 'Hansen MHS', 'Lien S', 'van Son M']","['Norsvin SA, Storhamargata 44, 2317, Hamar, Norway. eli.grindflek@norsvin.no.', 'Norsvin SA, Storhamargata 44, 2317, Hamar, Norway.', 'Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences, Centre for Integrative Genetics (CIGENE), Norwegian University of Life Sciences, PO Box 5003, As, Norway.', 'Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences, Centre for Integrative Genetics (CIGENE), Norwegian University of Life Sciences, PO Box 5003, As, Norway.', 'Norsvin SA, Storhamargata 44, 2317, Hamar, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Animals', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Haplotypes', 'Hernia, Umbilical/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/*genetics', 'Swine']",['NOTNLM'],"['GWAS', 'Genome-wide association study', 'Hernia', 'LIF', 'OSM', 'Pigs', 'Umbilical']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/12/19 06:00,['2018/05/31 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-018-4812-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-018-4812-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2018 May 29;19(1):412. doi: 10.1186/s12864-018-4812-9.,,,PMC5975507,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0407-0279'],,['174523/Research council of Norway'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the level of Tregs, expression of Tim-3 on peripheral blood T cells, expression of CD200 in myeloid blasts in newly diagnosed AML patients with normal cytogenetics (AML-NC) and their prognostic impact. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 40 patients with de novo AML-NC and 20 healthy controls. Flow-cytometry was used for detection of CD4+CD25+high FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, Tim-3 expression on peripheral blood T cells and CD200 expression on myeloid blasts. RESULTS: The percentages of CD4+CD25+high and CD4+CD25+high Foxp3+ Tregs were significantly increased in AML patients than controls. The levels of Tregs, Tim-3/CD4+, Tim-3/CD8+, CD200 and MFI of CD200 were significantly lower in responding patients than in those with persistent leukemia. Only high CD200 expression (> 50%) showed statistically significant worse OS with P< 0.04. CONCLUSION: The increased levels of Tregs, Tim-3 expression on peripheral blood T cells and CD200 expression in myeloid blast in AML patients could play a role in the development of AML.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are commonly used to treat CML; however, drug resistance of CML cells to TKIs has limited their clinical application. Shikonin, a traditional Chinese herb, has long been used to treat leukemia in China, but the roles and related molecular mechanisms of shikonin treatment in CML remain unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of shikonin on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of K562 cells, a CML cell line. METHODS: Firstly, K562 cell proliferation and apoptosis were tested by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Cell migration was measured by Transwell migration assay. In addition, western blot was performed to determine the proteins (PI3K, Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, PTEN, p-AKT, AKT, CXCR4, SDF-1, CD44) involved in the mechanism of action of shikonin. Finally, neutrophils from peripheral blood of CML patients were obtained, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were tested by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Shikonin reduced the proliferation of K562 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and promoted the apoptosis of K562 cells. Moreover, shikonin increased the PTEN level and inactivated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, subsequently upregulating BAX in K562 cells. In addition, shikonin could block K562 cell migration via the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis. Finally, shikonin significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of neutrophils from CML patients. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that shikonin inhibits CML proliferation and migration and induces apoptosis by the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, revealing the effects of shikonin therapy on CML.","['Chen, Yu', 'Wang, Tongtong', 'Du, Jing', 'Li, Yanchun', 'Wang, Xin', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Yu, XingXing', 'Fan, Weimin', 'Zhu, Qiaojuan', 'Tong, Xiangmin', 'Wang, Ying']","['Chen Y', 'Wang T', 'Du J', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Zhou Y', 'Yu X', 'Fan W', 'Zhu Q', 'Tong X', 'Wang Y']","['Laboratory Medical College, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", 'Graduate Department, BengBu Medical College, BengBu, China.', 'Department of Second Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", 'Laboratory Medical College, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", 'Laboratory Medical College, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180524,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'PTEN', 'Proliferation', 'Shikonin']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/08/16 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2018/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['000490142 [pii]', '10.1159/000490142 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2018;47(3):981-993. doi: 10.1159/000490142.

Five active extracts were further tested in cancer and normal cell lines from other tissues, including three skin cell lines with increasing degree of malignancy. An extract from the leaves of Daphne laureola L. (Thymelaeaceae) showed a striking potency and selectivity on lung cancer cells and leukemia cells; the IC50 values against these cancer cells were approximately 10,000-fold lower than against the normal cells. Daphnane-type diterpene orthoesters may be responsible for this highly selective anticancer activity.","['Calderon-Montano, Jose Manuel', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Sara Maria', 'Burgos-Moron, Estefania', 'Guillen-Mancina, Emilio', 'Jimenez-Alonso, Julio Jose', 'Garcia, Felipe', 'Aparicio, Abelardo', 'Lopez-Lazaro, Miguel']","['Calderon-Montano JM', 'Martinez-Sanchez SM', 'Burgos-Moron E', 'Guillen-Mancina E', 'Jimenez-Alonso JJ', 'Garcia F', 'Aparicio A', 'Lopez-Lazaro M']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Vegetal Biology and Ecology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Vegetal Biology and Ecology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Vegetal Biology and Ecology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, University of Seville , Sevilla , Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,England,Nat Prod Res,Natural product research,101167924,IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daphne/*chemistry', 'Diterpenes/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spain', 'Thymelaeaceae/chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'daphnane diterpenes', 'leukemia', 'lung cancer']",2018/05/31 06:00,2020/01/03 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14786419.2018.1480620 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Prod Res. 2019 Dec;33(23):3454-3458. doi: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1480620.

These diets, known as neutropenic or low-bacteria diets, are prescribed across the country with little uniformity in the extent or content of prescription. These diets are difficult to follow and force patients to omit fresh fruits and vegetables and limit dairy and meat products from their diet. These dietary omissions compromise nutritional intake in patients who are already at high risk of malnutrition. Randomized trials have shown that these restrictive diets are not superior in preventing infections than more liberalized diets. Evidence shows that adherence to the Safe Food-Handling guidelines issued by the Food and Drug Administration, a mandate for all hospital kitchens, provides adequate protection against food-borne infection, precluding the need for the neutropenic diet. Thus, routine use of the neutropenic diet should be abandoned.","['Wolfe, Heather R', 'Sadeghi, Navid', 'Agrawal, Deepak', 'Johnson, David H', 'Gupta, Arjun']","['Wolfe HR', 'Sadeghi N', 'Agrawal D', 'Johnson DH', 'Gupta A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Parkland Health and Hospital System, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Parkland Health and Hospital System, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Parkland Health and Hospital System, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA. guptaarjun90@gmail.com.', 'Parkland Health and Hospital System, Dallas, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180530,United States,J Hosp Med,Journal of hospital medicine,101271025,IM,"['Aged', 'Diet/*standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*diet therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/therapy']",,,2018/05/31 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12788/jhm.2985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hosp Med. 2018 Aug 1;13(8):573-576. doi: 10.12788/jhm.2985.

Patients and Methods Three hundred sixty-five adult survivors of childhood ALL and 365 controls with no cancer history completed assessments of PN (modified Total Neuropathy Score [mTNS]), static balance (Sensory Organization Test [SOT]), mobility (Timed Up and Go), walking endurance (6-minute walk test), QoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Survey), and visual-motor processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale). Results PN, but not impairments, in performance on SOT was more common in survivors than controls (41.4% v 9.5%, respectively; P < .001). In multivariable models, higher mTNS scores were associated with longer time to complete the Timed Up and Go (beta = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.23; P < .001), shorter distance walked in 6 minutes (beta = -4.39; 95% CI, -8.63 to -0.14; P = .04), and reduced QoL (beta = -1.33; 95% CI, -1.79 to -0.87; P < .001 for physical functioning; beta = -1.16; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.67; P < .001 for role physical; and beta = -0.88; 95% CI, -1.34 to -0.42; P < .001 for general health). Processing speed (beta = 1.69; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.40; P < .001), but not mTNS score, was associated with anterior-posterior sway on the SOT. Conclusion PN in long-term ALL survivors is associated with movement, including mobility and walking endurance, but not with static standing balance. The association between processing speed and sway suggests that static balance impairment in ALL survivors may be influenced by problems with CNS function, including the processing of sensory information.","['Varedi, Mitra', 'Lu, Lu', 'Howell, Carrie R', 'Partin, Robyn E', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'McKenna, Raymond F']","['Varedi M', 'Lu L', 'Howell CR', 'Partin RE', 'Hudson MM', 'Pui CH', 'Krull KR', 'Robison LL', 'Ness KK', 'McKenna RF']","[""Mitra Varedi and Raymond F.

Compared with imatinib, dasatinib has increased potency, CNS penetration, and activity against imatinib-resistant clones. Patients and Methods Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial AALL0622 (Bristol Myers Squibb trial CA180-204) tested safety and feasibility of adding dasatinib to intensive chemotherapy starting at induction day 15 in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia age 1 to 30 years. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) was recommended for patients at high risk based on slow response and for those with a matched family donor regardless of response after at least 11 weeks of therapy. Patients at standard risk based on rapid response received chemotherapy plus dasatinib for an additional 120 weeks. Patients with overt CNS leukemia received cranial irradiation. Results Sixty eligible patients were enrolled. Five-year overall (OS) and event-free survival rates (+/- standard deviations [SD]) were 86% +/- 5% and 60% +/- 7% overall, 87% +/- 5% and 61% +/- 7% for standard-risk patients (n = 48; 19% underwent HSCT), and 89% +/- 13% and 67% +/- 19% for high-risk patients (n = 9; 89% underwent HSCT), respectively. Five-year cumulative incidence (+/- SD) of CNS relapse was 15% +/- 6%. Outcomes (+/- SDs) were similar to those in COG AALL0031, which used the same chemotherapy with continuous imatinib: 5-year OS of 81% +/- 6% versus 86% +/- 5% ( P = .63) and 5-year disease-free survival of 68% +/- 7% versus 60% +/- 7% ( P = 0.31) for AALL0031 versus AALL0622, respectively. IKZF1 deletions, present in 56% of tested patients, were associated with significantly inferior OS and event-free survival overall and in standard-risk patients. Conclusion Dasatinib was well tolerated with chemotherapy and provided outcomes similar to those with imatinib in COG AALL0031, where all patients received cranial irradiation. Our results support limiting HSCT to slow responders and suggest a potential role for transplantation in rapid responders with IKZF1 deletions.","['Slayton, William B', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Kairalla, John A', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Mi, Xinlei', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Chang, Bill H', 'Mullighan, Charles', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Mizrahy, Sherri L', 'Merchant, Thomas', 'Brown, Valerie I', 'Sieger, Lance', 'Siegel, Marilyn J', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Slayton WB', 'Schultz KR', 'Kairalla JA', 'Devidas M', 'Mi X', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Chang BH', 'Mullighan C', 'Iacobucci I', 'Silverman LB', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Wood BL', 'Mizrahy SL', 'Merchant T', 'Brown VI', 'Sieger L', 'Siegel MJ', 'Raetz EA', 'Winick NJ', 'Loh ML', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP']","[""William B.

However, little is known about its expression levels and clinical implication in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was done to evaluate PARP-1 expression levels in the bone marrow of 65 patients with non-M3 AML and 54 healthy counterparts. The correlation of PARP-1 expression with clinicopathological features of non-M3 AML patients was also analyzed. RESULTS: Non-M3 AML patients have higher PARP-1 expression than the healthy controls (p < 0.01). Patients with adverse cytogenetic risk have higher PARP-1 expression than other cytogenetic risk groups (p = 0.004). The PARP-1 median expression level divided AML patients into PARP-1 low-expressed and PARP-1 high-expressed groups. High expression levels of PARP-1 were associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p = 0.01) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.005). Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that high PARP-1 expression was an independent risk factor for both OS and RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PARP-1 overexpression may define an important risk factor in non-M3 AML patients and PARP-1 is a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment.","['Pashaiefar, Hossein', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Tavakkoly-Bazzaz, Javad', 'Ghaffari, Seyed Hamid', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Izadi, Pantea', 'Izadifard, Marzie', 'Kasaeian, Amir', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Pashaiefar H', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Tavakkoly-Bazzaz J', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Momeny M', 'Izadi P', 'Izadifard M', 'Kasaeian A', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '4 Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '4 Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '1 Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran, Iran .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['PARP-1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'overall survival', 'prognosis', 'relapse-free survival']",2018/05/31 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2018.0085 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2018 Jun;22(6):343-349. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2018.0085.

CD19 is a B-cell specific molecule related to the survival and proliferation of normal B cells. However, there is little information available on the effects of CD19 on the biological behavior of Ph+ ALL cells. In this study, we explored a lentiviral vector-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector to stably reduce CD19 expression in Ph+ ALL cell line SUP-B15 cells and investigated the effects of CD19 downregulation on cell proliferation, apoptosis, drug sensitivity, cell adhesion, cell migration and cell invasion in vitro. CD19 mRNA and protein expression levels were inhibited significantly by CD19 shRNA. Down-regulation of CD19 could inhibit cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion, and increase cell apoptosis and the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and imatinib in SUP-B15 cells. Moreover, we found that down-regulation of CD19 expression inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in SUP-B15 cells in a p53-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that lentiviral vector-mediated RNA interference of CD19 gene may be a promising strategy in the treatment of Ph+ ALL.","['Wu, Junqing', 'Liang, Bin', 'Qian, Yan', 'Tang, Liyuan', 'Xing, Chongyun', 'Zhuang, Qiang', 'Shen, Zhijian', 'Jiang, Songfu', 'Yu, Kang', 'Feng, Jianhua']","['Wu J', 'Liang B', 'Qian Y', 'Tang L', 'Xing C', 'Zhuang Q', 'Shen Z', 'Jiang S', 'Yu K', 'Feng J']","['Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180615,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD19', 'SUP-B15 cells', 'cell apoptosis', 'cell motility', 'drug sensitivity', 'p53']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.10994 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2018 Sep;42(9):1228-1239. doi: 10.1002/cbin.10994.

Because this virus has also been associated with better prognosis in the setting of co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus, we further assessed the association of HPgV with prognosis. We used risk factor data and banked plasma samples from 2094 lymphoma cases newly diagnosed between 2002 and 2009 and 1572 frequency-matched controls. Plasma samples were tested for HPgV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and those with RNA concentrations <5000 genome equivalents/ml were confirmed using nested RT-PCR methods. To assess the role of HPgV in lymphoma prognosis, we used 2948 cases from a cohort study of newly diagnosed lymphoma patients (included all cases from the case-control study).

We hypothesized that time-series gene expression profiles (GEPs) of bone marrow samples during remission-induction therapy can measure the response and be used for relapse prediction. We computed the time-series changes from diagnosis to Day 8 of remission-induction, termed Effective Response Metric (ERM-D8) and tested its ability to predict relapse against contemporary risk assignment methods, including National Cancer Institutes (NCI) criteria, genetics and minimal residual disease (MRD). ERM-D8 was trained on a set of 131 patients and validated on an independent set of 79 patients. In the independent blinded test set, unfavourable ERM-D8 patients had >3-fold increased risk of relapse compared to favourable ERM-D8 (5-year cumulative incidence of relapse 38.1% vs. 10.6%; P = 2.5 x 10(-3) ). ERM-D8 remained predictive of relapse [P = 0.05; Hazard ratio 4.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-16.23] after adjusting for NCI criteria, genetics, Day 8 peripheral response and Day 33 MRD. ERM-D8 improved risk stratification in favourable genetics subgroups (P = 0.01) and Day 33 MRD positive patients (P = 1.7 x 10(-3) ). We conclude that our novel metric - ERM-D8 - based on time-series GEP after 8 days of remission-induction therapy can independently predict relapse even after adjusting for NCI risk, genetics, Day 8 peripheral blood response and MRD.","['Yeoh, Allen E-J', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Dong, Difeng', 'Lu, Yi', 'Jiang, Nan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Tan, Ah Moy', 'Lin, Hai Peng', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Wong, Limsoon']","['Yeoh AE', 'Li Z', 'Dong D', 'Lu Y', 'Jiang N', 'Trka J', 'Tan AM', 'Lin HP', 'Quah TC', 'Ariffin H', 'Wong L']","['Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore."", '2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Paediatrics, KK Women's & Children's Hospital, Singapore."", 'Sime Darby Medical Centre, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.', 'Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya Cancer Research Institute, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/genetics/*mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*effective response metric', '*gene expression', '*relapse', '*time-series']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.15252 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Jun;181(5):653-663. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15252.,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3623-6571'],['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population-based trends in the cure proportion and survival of the uncured for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by clinical prognostic risk factors were estimated using flexible parametric cure models, based on overall survival and event-free survival. Children aged 1-17 years diagnosed between 1990 and 2011 in Yorkshire, UK, were included (n = 492). The percentage cured increased from 77% (95% confidence interval 70-84%) in 1990-1997 to 89% (84-93%) in 2003-2011, while the median survival time of the uncured decreased from 3.2 years (2.2-4.1 years) to 0.7 years (0-1.5 years). Models based on event-free survival showed a similar trend. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse substantially decreased from 35% in 1990-97 to 9% in 2003-2011.

Tyrosine kinase activity of fusion protein BCR-ABL is the main cause of CML. Even if imatinib is used as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for CML therapy, drug resistance may occur in patients and the clinical failure of imatinib treatment in resistant patients had resulted with the use of another alternative TKIs. BCR-ABL dependent and independent molecular mechanisms have crucial roles in drug resistance. To reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms which play significant roles in imatinib resistance in CML, we established K562 imatinib-resistant cell line (K562r5) which was continuously exposed to (5microM) imatinib to investigate molecular mechanisms which play significant roles in drug resistance. First of all, we analyzed T315I, M351T, F315L and F359C/L/V mutations with DNA sequencing as a BCR-ABL dependent mechanism in our cell lines. Moreover, we investigated BCR-ABL independent mechanisms such as apoptosis, autophagy, drug transport and DNA repair which affect drug resistance in these cell lines. In vitro cell viability was determined by MTT assay. DNA sequencing analysis was performed to detect BCR-ABL mutations. The apoptotic effect of imatinib on CML cell lines was tested by flow cytometric Annexin V-PE staining and caspase activation assays. Apoptotic, autophagic, drug transporter and DNA repair genes expression levels were determined by RT-PCR. The conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on K562s and K562r cells. Our results indicate that inhibition of apoptosis, induction of autophagy, overexpression of efflux gene MDR1 and down-regulation of influx gene OCT1 play crucial roles in the progression of imatinib resistance.","['Hekmatshoar, Yalda', 'Ozkan, Tulin', 'Altinok Gunes, Buket', 'Bozkurt, Sureyya', 'Karadag, Aynur', 'Karabay, Arzu Zeynep', 'Sunguroglu, Asuman']","['Hekmatshoar Y', 'Ozkan T', 'Altinok Gunes B', 'Bozkurt S', 'Karadag A', 'Karabay AZ', 'Sunguroglu A']","['Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Istinye University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemistry, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180515,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'CML', 'DNA Repair.', 'Drug transporter proteins', 'Imatinib resistance']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/11/08 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2018 May 15;64(6):23-30.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We pooled data from multiple studies to assess the association with distance and evaluate whether it is due to magnetic fields or other factors associated with distance from lines. METHODS: We present a pooled analysis combining individual-level data (29,049 cases and 68,231 controls) from 11 record-based studies. RESULTS: There was no material association between childhood leukaemia and distance to nearest overhead power line of any voltage. Among children living < 50 m from 200 + kV power lines, the adjusted odds ratio for childhood leukaemia was 1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.93). The odds ratio was higher among children diagnosed before age 5 years. There was no association with calculated magnetic fields. Odds ratios remained unchanged with adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In this first comprehensive pooled analysis of childhood leukaemia and distance to power lines, we found a small and imprecise risk for residences < 50 m of 200 + kV lines that was not explained by high magnetic fields. Reasons for the increased risk, found in this and many other studies, remains to be elucidated.","['Amoon, Aryana T', 'Crespi, Catherine M', 'Ahlbom, Anders', 'Bhatnagar, Megha', 'Bray, Isabelle', 'Bunch, Kathryn J', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Feychting, Maria', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Johansen, Christoffer', 'Kreis, Christian', 'Malagoli, Carlotta', 'Marquant, Fabienne', 'Pedersen, Camilla', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Roosli, Martin', 'Spycher, Ben D', 'Sudan, Madhuri', 'Swanson, John', 'Tittarelli, Andrea', 'Tuck, Deirdre M', 'Tynes, Tore', 'Vergara, Ximena', 'Vinceti, Marco', 'Wunsch-Filho, Victor', 'Kheifets, Leeka']","['Amoon AT', 'Crespi CM', 'Ahlbom A', 'Bhatnagar M', 'Bray I', 'Bunch KJ', 'Clavel J', 'Feychting M', 'Hemon D', 'Johansen C', 'Kreis C', 'Malagoli C', 'Marquant F', 'Pedersen C', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Roosli M', 'Spycher BD', 'Sudan M', 'Swanson J', 'Tittarelli A', 'Tuck DM', 'Tynes T', 'Vergara X', 'Vinceti M', 'Wunsch-Filho V', 'Kheifets L']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1772, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1772, USA.', 'Unit of Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1772, USA.', 'Department of Health and Social Sciences, University of the West of England, Bristol, BS16 1QY, UK.', 'National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers, CRESS, INSERM, UMR 1153, Paris Descartes University, Villejuif, France.', 'National Registry of Childhood Cancers -

Understanding the nature of these pathologies and developing treatments for them are hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. Herein, we describe a mouse model recapitulating key features of CRS and neurotoxicity. In humanized mice with high leukemia burden, CAR T cell-mediated clearance of cancer triggered high fever and elevated IL-6 levels, which are hallmarks of CRS. Human monocytes were the major source of IL-1 and IL-6 during CRS. Accordingly, the syndrome was prevented by monocyte depletion or by blocking IL-6 receptor with tocilizumab. Nonetheless, tocilizumab failed to protect mice from delayed lethal neurotoxicity, characterized by meningeal inflammation. Instead, the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra abolished both CRS and neurotoxicity, resulting in substantially extended leukemia-free survival. These findings offer a therapeutic strategy to tackle neurotoxicity and open new avenues to safer CAR T cell therapies.","['Norelli, Margherita', 'Camisa, Barbara', 'Barbiera, Giulia', 'Falcone, Laura', 'Purevdorj, Ayurzana', 'Genua, Marco', 'Sanvito, Francesca', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Doglioni, Claudio', 'Cristofori, Patrizia', 'Traversari, Catia', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Ostuni, Renato', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Casucci, Monica', 'Bondanza, Attilio']","['Norelli M', 'Camisa B', 'Barbiera G', 'Falcone L', 'Purevdorj A', 'Genua M', 'Sanvito F', 'Ponzoni M', 'Doglioni C', 'Cristofori P', 'Traversari C', 'Bordignon C', 'Ciceri F', 'Ostuni R', 'Bonini C', 'Casucci M', 'Bondanza A']","['Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Genomics of the Innate Immune System Unit, San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Genomics of the Innate Immune System Unit, San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milano, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'San-Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milano, Italy.', 'Molmed Spa, Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Molmed Spa, Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Genomics of the Innate Immune System Unit, San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milano, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy.', 'Experimental Hematology Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Innovative Immunotherapies Unit, San Raffaele Hospital Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy. attilio.bondanza@gmail.com.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy. attilio.bondanza@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180528,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Neurotoxins/*toxicity', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*metabolism', 'Syndrome']",,,2018/05/29 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41591-018-0036-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-018-0036-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2018 Jun;24(6):739-748. doi: 10.1038/s41591-018-0036-4.

Although a majority of patients will achieve a complete response following a single infusion of CD19-targeted CAR-modified T cells (CD19 CAR T cells)(2-4), the broad applicability of this treatment is hampered by severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by fever, hypotension and respiratory insufficiency associated with elevated serum cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6)(2,5). CRS usually occurs within days of T cell infusion at the peak of CAR T cell expansion. In ALL, it is most frequent and more severe in patients with high tumor burden(2-4). CRS may respond to IL-6 receptor blockade but can require further treatment with high dose corticosteroids to curb potentially lethal severity(2-9). Improved therapeutic and preventive treatments require a better understanding of CRS physiopathology, which has so far remained elusive. Here we report a murine model of CRS that develops within 2-3 d of CAR T cell infusion and that is potentially lethal and responsive to IL-6 receptor blockade. We show that its severity is mediated not by CAR T cell-derived cytokines, but by IL-6, IL-1 and nitric oxide (NO) produced by recipient macrophages, which enables new therapeutic interventions.","['Giavridis, Theodoros', 'van der Stegen, Sjoukje J C', 'Eyquem, Justin', 'Hamieh, Mohamad', 'Piersigilli, Alessandra', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Giavridis T', 'van der Stegen SJC', 'Eyquem J', 'Hamieh M', 'Piersigilli A', 'Sadelain M']","['Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Comparative Pathology, Rockefeller University, Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA. m-sadelain@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180528,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Syndrome']",,,2018/05/29 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/05/30 06:00'],"['2017/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41591-018-0041-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-018-0041-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2018 Jun;24(6):731-738. doi: 10.1038/s41591-018-0041-7.

In addition to survival estimates, identification of factors related to the probability of leukemic progression might help prognosis assessment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study is a retrospective analysis of 409 patients with primary LR-MDS. The probability of leukemic progression was estimated in the competing risk framework by the cumulative incidence method considering death without acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a competing event. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (16.1%) progressed to AML. The following covariates influenced the probability of leukemic progression in a multivariate competing risk regression model: intermediate karyotype versus diploid or chromosome 5 deletion, 5% to 9% bone marrow blast percentage, platelet count <50 x 10e(9)/L and age younger than 75 years. CONCLUSION: According to these, a predictive model is proposed, which categorizes patients with different probability of leukemic progression (P < .001). Validation of these results might help prognostic refinement of patients with LR-MDS.","['Falantes, Jose F', 'Marquez-Malaver, Francisco J', 'Calderon-Cabrera, Cristina', 'Pedrote, Begona', 'Martino, Maria L', 'Gonzalez, Jose', 'Espigado, Ildefonso', 'Perez-Simon, Jose A']","['Falantes JF', 'Marquez-Malaver FJ', 'Calderon-Cabrera C', 'Pedrote B', 'Martino ML', 'Gonzalez J', 'Espigado I', 'Perez-Simon JA']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain.

Among the different genome-wide DNA methylation technologies, whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) is considered the gold standard for assaying genome-wide DNA methylation at single base resolution. However, the high sequencing cost to achieve the optimal depth of coverage limits its application in both basic and clinical research. To achieve 15x coverage of the human methylome, using WGBS, requires approximately three lanes of 100-bp-paired-end Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing. It is important, therefore, for advances in sequencing technologies to be developed to enable cost-effective high-coverage sequencing. RESULTS: In this study, we provide an optimised WGBS methodology, from library preparation to sequencing and data processing, to enable 16-20x genome-wide coverage per single lane of HiSeq X Ten, HCS 3.3.76. To process and analyse the data, we developed a WGBS pipeline (METH10X) that is fast and can call SNPs. We performed WGBS on both high-quality intact DNA and degraded DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. First, we compared different library preparation methods on the HiSeq 2500 platform to identify the best method for sequencing on the HiSeq X Ten. Second, we optimised the PhiX and genome spike-ins to achieve higher quality and coverage of WGBS data on the HiSeq X Ten. Third, we performed integrated whole genome sequencing (WGS) and WGBS of the same DNA sample in a single lane of HiSeq X Ten to improve data output. Finally, we compared methylation data from the HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq X Ten and found high concordance (Pearson r > 0.9x). CONCLUSIONS: Together we provide a systematic, efficient and complete approach to perform and analyse WGBS on the HiSeq X Ten. Our protocol allows for large-scale WGBS studies at reasonable processing time and cost on the HiSeq X Ten platform.","['Nair, Shalima S', 'Luu, Phuc-Loi', 'Qu, Wenjia', 'Maddugoda, Madhavi',

Degradation of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, mediated by Keap1-Cullin3/RING box1 (Cul3-Rbx1) E3 ubiquitin ligase and the proteasome, is considered the primary pathway controlling the cellular abundance of Nrf2. Although the nucleus has been implicated in the degradation of Nrf2, little information is available on how this compartment participates in degrading Nrf2. METHODS: Here, we fused the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra2 to Nrf2 and capitalized on the irreversible change in color (green to red) that occurs when Dendra2 undergoes photoconversion to study degradation of Dendra2-Nrf2 in single live cells. RESULTS: Using this approach, we show that the half-life (t1/2) of Dendra2-Nrf2 in the whole cell, under homeostatic conditions, is 35 min. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG-132 or induction of oxidative stress with tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) extended the half-life of Dendra2-Nrf2 by 6- and 28-fold, respectively. By inhibiting nuclear export using Leptomycin B, we provide direct evidence that degradation of Nrf2 also occurs in the nucleus and involves PML-NBs (Promyelocytic Leukemia-nuclear bodies). We further demonstrate that co-expression of Dendra2-Nrf2 and Crimson-PML-I lacking two PML-I sumoylation sites (K65R and K490R) changed the decay rate of Dendra2-Nrf2 in the nucleus and stabilized the nuclear derived Nrf2 levels in whole cells. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our findings provide direct evidence for degradation of Nrf2 in the nucleus and suggest that modification of Nrf2 in PML nuclear bodies contributes to its degradation in intact cells.","['Burroughs, Andrea Flores', 'Eluhu, Sylvia', 'Whalen, Diva', 'Goodwin, J Shawn', 'Sakwe, Amos M', 'Arinze, Ifeanyi J']","['Burroughs AF', 'Eluhu S', 'Whalen D', 'Goodwin JS', 'Sakwe AM', 'Arinze IJ']","['Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Graduate Studies and Research, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Graduate Studies and Research, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Graduate Studies and Research, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Graduate Studies and Research, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Light', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nordefrin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sumoylation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell biology', 'Dendra2', 'Fluorescent protein', 'Nrf2', 'Nuclear degradation', 'Photoconversion', 'Promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies', 'Proteasome', 'PyFDAP']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['000490033 [pii]', '10.1159/000490033 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2018;47(2):800-816. doi: 10.1159/000490033.

Recently, PDT has been used as a first-line treatment for colon cancer; however, limited curative effect was obtained due to resistance of CRC to PDT. During the past decades, accumulating CRC-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs have been reported to exert diverse functions through various biological processes; their dysregulation might trigger and/or promote the pathological changes. Herein, we performed microarrays analysis to identify dysregulated lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in PDT-treated HCT116 cells to figure out the lncRNA-miRNA interactions related to the resistance of CRC to PDT treatment, and the downstream mRNA target, as well as the molecular mechanism. We found a total of 1096 lncRNAs dysregulated in PDT-treated CRC HCT116 cells; among them, LIFR-AS1 negatively interacted with miR-29a, one of the dysregulated miRNAs in PDT-treated CRC cells, to affect the resistance of CRC to PDT. LIFR-AS1 knockdown attenuated, whereas miR-29a inhibition enhanced the cellular effect of PDT on HCT116 cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, among the dysregulated mRNAs, TNFAIP3 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-29a and exerted a similar effect to LIFR-AS1 on the cellular effects of PDT. In summary, LIFR-AS1 serves as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-29a to inhibit its expression and up-regulate downstream target TNFAIP3 expression, finally modulating the resistance of CRC to PDT. We provide an experimental basis for this lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA network being a promising target in CRC resistance to PDT treatment.","['Liu, Kuijie', 'Yao, Hongliang', 'Wen, Yu', 'Zhao, Hua', 'Zhou, Nanjiang', 'Lei, Sanlin', 'Xiong, Li']","['Liu K', 'Yao H', 'Wen Y', 'Zhao H', 'Zhou N', 'Lei S', 'Xiong L']","['Department of General Surgery, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and the leukemia went into remission. Aggressive surgery can benefit immunocompromised patients with mucormycosis.","['Kalogerakos, Paris-Dimitrios', 'Kiparakis, Michael', 'Pavlaki, Kostantia', 'Pontikoglou, Charalampos', 'Lazopoulos, George', 'Chalkiadakis, George']","['Kalogerakos PD', 'Kiparakis M', 'Pavlaki K', 'Pontikoglou C', 'Lazopoulos G', 'Chalkiadakis G']","['Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece.

With the exception of Down syndrome-associated transient abnormal myelopoiesis, which is not considered here, neonatal leukaemias are rare. In two-thirds of patients the disease manifests as an acute myeloid leukaemia, frequently with monocytic/monoblastic characteristics. Most other cases are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, particularly B lineage, but some are mixed phenotype or blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms. The most frequently observed cytogenetic/molecular abnormality is t(4;11)(q21.3;q23.3)/KMT2A-AFF1 followed by t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.1)/RBM15-MKL1 and t(8;16)(p11.2;p13.3)/KAT6A-CREBBP. Common clinical features include prominent hepatosplenomegaly and a high incidence of skin involvement, sometimes in the absence of bone marrow disease. A distinctive feature is the occurrence of spontaneous remission in some cases, particularly in association with t(8;16). In this review, we summarise current knowledge of the clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features of neonatal leukaemia and discuss clinical management of these cases.","['Roberts, Irene', 'Fordham, Nicholas J', 'Rao, Anupama', 'Bain, Barbara J']","['Roberts I', 'Fordham NJ', 'Rao A', 'Bain BJ']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Centre for Haematology, Oxford, UK.', 'Oxford BRC Blood Theme, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Centre, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Centre for Haematology, Oxford, UK.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', ""St Mary's Hospital campus of Imperial College London, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180528,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Exanthema/congenital/genetics/therapy', 'Gene Order/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*congenital/genetics/therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['* KMT2A', '*congenital leukaemia', '*neonatal leukaemia', '*spontaneous remission']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15246 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Jul;182(2):170-184. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15246.

Inclusion of CD200 has been reported to contribute to more reliable differentiation between CLL and MCL. We investigated the value of CD200 in assessment of atypical CLL cases. METHODS: CD200 expression on mature B cell neoplasms was studied by eight-color flow cytometry in combination with a conventional panel of flow cytometry markers. The study included 70 control samples, 63 samples with CLL or atypical CLL phenotype, 6 MCL samples, and 40 samples of other mature B cell neoplasms. RESULTS: All CLL samples were positive for CD200, whereas MCL samples were dim or negative for CD200. Of the CLL samples, 7 were atypical by conventional flow cytometry, with Matutes scores </=3. These cases were tested for evidence of a t(11;14) translocation, characteristic of MCL, and all were negative, consistent with their classification as atypical CLL. All these atypical CLL samples were strongly positive for CD200. CONCLUSION: CD200 proved to be a useful marker for differentiation between CLL and MCL by flow cytometry. In particular, CD200 was useful in distinguishing CLL samples with atypical immunophenotypes from MCL.","['Ting, Y S', 'Smith, S A B C', 'Brown, D A', 'Dodds, A J', 'Fay, K C', 'Ma, D D F', 'Milliken, S', 'Moore, J J', 'Sewell, W A']","['Ting YS', 'Smith SABC', 'Brown DA', 'Dodds AJ', 'Fay KC', 'Ma DDF', 'Milliken S', 'Moore JJ', 'Sewell WA']","[""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", 'NSW Health Pathology and ICPMR, Westmead, NSW, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Pathology (SydPath), St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia."", ""St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180527,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD200', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'immunophenotypic analysis', 'lymphoma']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/05/29 06:01,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/29 06:01 [medline]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12857 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2018 Oct;40(5):533-539. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12857.

A large cohort of 397 patients-320 treated front line with imatinib, 25 with dasatinib, and 53 with nilotinib-was retrospectively analyzed at a single institution. The eGFR was calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation for all patients at baseline and then at 6 and 12 months, and at the last follow-up. Taking into account eGFR changes during the first year of treatment and excluding other possible cardiovascular risk factors, we considered also the percentage of cardiovascular events in patients with modifications of this single parameter. Imatinib induced a decrease in median eGFR (p = 0.01): 42 patients treated with imatinib had a cardiovascular event, related to modification of eGFR, in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors. In patients treated with nilotinib, the median eGFR did not decline from baseline: only 1 patient experienced an ischemic event, but the eGFR remained unchanged. In patients treated with dasatinib, the mean eGFR did not change significantly: 3 patients experienced a cardiac ischemic event, but in all patients the eGFR remained unchanged over time, while advanced age and metabolic alterations contributed to the ischemic events. This long-term follow-up has documented that imatinib may induce changes in the eGFR, which may contribute to the onset of ischemic events. Further analyses on larger series of CML patients are required to conclusively define the potential renal toxicity of second generation TKIs and the consequent risk of developing ischemic events.","['Molica, Matteo', 'Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Fegatelli, Danilo Alunni', 'Massaro, Fulvio', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Foa, Robin', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Molica M', 'Scalzulli E', 'Colafigli G', 'Fegatelli DA', 'Massaro F', 'Latagliata R', 'Foa R', 'Breccia M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. molica@bce.uniroma1.it.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Statistical Sciences, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180527,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Dasatinib/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Kidney Tubules/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Ischemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiovascular events', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Estimated glomerular filtration']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/08/24 06:00,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2018/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3375-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3375-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Oct;97(10):1803-1808. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3375-9.

A total of 259 patients who were diagnosed of de novo AML were enrolled in this study. Mutation profiling of 16 candidate genes were performed in bone marrow samples by using Sanger sequencing.We identified at least 1 mutation in 199 of the 259 samples (76.8%), and 2 or more mutations in 31.7% of samples. FLT3-ITD was the most common mutated gene (16.2%, 42/259), followed by CEBPA (15.1%, 39/259), NRAS (14.7%, 38/259), and NPM1 (13.5%, 35/259). Concurrence was observed in 97.1% of the NPM1 mutated cases and in 29.6% of the double mutated CEBPA cases. Distinct patterns of co-occurrence were observed for different hotspot mutations within the IDH2 gene: R140 mutations were associated with NPM1 and/or FLT3-ITD mutations, whereas R172 mutations co-occurred with DNMT3A mutations only. Concurrence was also observed in 86.6% of epigenetic regulation genes, most of which co-occurred with NPM1 mutations. The results showed certain rules in the mutation profiling and concurrence of AML patients, which was related to the function classification of genes. Defining the mutation spectrum and mutation pattern of AML will contribute to the comprehensive assessment of patients and identification of new therapeutic targets.","['Zhang, Yang', 'Wang, Fang', 'Chen, Xue', 'Liu, Wenjing', 'Fang, Jiancheng', 'Wang, Mingyu', 'Teng, Wen', 'Cao, Panxiang', 'Liu, Hongxing']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang F', 'Chen X', 'Liu W', 'Fang J', 'Wang M', 'Teng W', 'Cao P', 'Liu H']","['Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Division, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Lang fang, 065201, China. lhongxing@outlook.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180526,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute', 'gene', 'leukemia', 'mutation', 'myeloid']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11684-018-0616-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11684-018-0616-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Front Med. 2019 Apr;13(2):229-237. doi: 10.1007/s11684-018-0616-1.

On neuroimaging these tumors were not specific, so the patients were suspected of cerebral recurrence of their primary neoplasm: leukemia in four children and sarcoma in one child. Histologically, the group contained four glioblastomas and one anaplastic astrocytoma. Three patients underwent neurosurgical resection, while the other two underwent stereotactic diagnostic biopsy only. Despite combined oncological treatment, four children died during 20 months, and only one glioblastoma patient continued to live for another twelve years. Microscopically, the neoplasms consisted of small cells with some morphologic features of astrocytic lineage, having scanty or prominent processes. Microvascular proliferation and focal or diffuse necrosis were encountered in four cases. The GFAP reactivity in neoplastic cells was low or nil, together with the expression of Olig2, vimentin, and nestin. In two cases a subpopulation of synaptophysin-positive cells was present. Molecular immunohistochemical profiling revealed the expression of phosphorylated forms of PI3Kp110 and AKT, in parallel to a strong PTEN and p53 positivity. The tumors were of IDH1R132H-wild type and immunoreactive for ATRX, HER3, and EGFR. Secondary malignant gliomas in pediatric cancer survivors pose a diagnostic challenge. The present study shows that these tumors are of IDH wild type, PI3K/AKT-activated, having no PTEN and EGFR mutations. Therefore, the biopsy of brain tumors in such patients is crucial both for accurate diagnosis and material preservation for molecular typing.","['Izycka-Swieszewska, Ewa', 'Bien, Ewa', 'Stefanowicz, Joanna', 'Szurowska, Edyta', 'Szutowicz-Zielinska, Ewa', 'Koczkowska, Magdalena', 'Sigorski, Dawid', 'Kloc, Wojciech', 'Rogowski, Wojciech', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta']","['Izycka-Swieszewska E', 'Bien E', 'Stefanowicz J', 'Szurowska E', 'Szutowicz-Zielinska E', 'Koczkowska M', 'Sigorski D', 'Kloc W', 'Rogowski W', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E']","['Department of Pathology and Neuropathology, Medical University of Gdansk and Department of Pathomorphology, Copernicus PL Hospitals, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Second Department of Radiology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Clinical Department of Oncology & Immunooncology, Hospital with Oncology Center MSW, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Copernicus Hospital, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Warmia-Mazury University, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Magodent, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180401,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Glioma/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnostic imaging/*pathology']",,,2018/05/29 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/4596812 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2018 Apr 1;2018:4596812. doi: 10.1155/2018/4596812. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5899852,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7550-1326', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2091-2686', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4799-9611']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because leukemogenesis-related signal pathways have been investigated and microarray sample data have been produced in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and normal cells, systems analysis in coupling pathways becomes possible. Based on system modeling and identification, we could construct the coupling pathways and their associated gene regulatory networks using microarray sample data. By applying system theory to the estimated system model in coupling pathways, we can then obtain transductivity sensitivity, basal sensitivity and error sensitivity of each protein to identify the potential impact of genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations and the coupling of other pathways from the perspective of energy, respectively. By comparing the results in AML, MDS and normal cells, we investigated the potential critical genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations that activate or repress specific cellular functions to promote MDS or AML leukemogenesis. We suggested that epigenetic modification of beta-catenin and signal integration of CSLs, AP-2alpha, STATs, c-Jun and beta-catenin could contribute to cell proliferation at AML and MDS. Epigenetic regulation of ERK and genetic mutation of p53 could lead to the repressed apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair in leukemic cells. Genetic mutation of JAK, epigenetic regulation of ERK, and signal integration of C/EBPalpha could result in the promotion of MDS cell differentiation. According to the results, we proposed three drugs, decitabine, genistein, and monorden for preventing AML leukemogenesis, while three drugs, decitabine, thalidomide, and geldanamycin, for preventing MDS leukemogenesis.","['Li, Cheng-Wei', 'Lai, Tzu-Ying', 'Chen, Bor-Sen']","['Li CW', 'Lai TY', 'Chen BS']","['Laboratory of Control and Systems Biology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Laboratory of Control and Systems Biology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Laboratory of Control and Systems Biology, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180504,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['basal sensitivity', 'error sensitivity', 'network robustness', 'transductivity', 'transductivity sensitivity']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/05/29 06:01,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2016/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25318 [doi]', '25318 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 May 4;9(34):23636-23660. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25318. eCollection 2018 May 4.,,,PMC5955113,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: 84 patients with increased diffuse BM uptake were retrospectively enrolled. Their complete case record and PET/CT images were reviewed, with the maximal standardized uptake values of bone marrow (SUVmaxBM) and other imaging/clinical features were noted. At the same time, the differences in imaging/clinical features between bone marrow MI and non-MI groups were compared. The decision tree for predicting MI was established by C5.0 component of SPSS Clementine. Results: In patients with homogenously increased BM uptake, 21 patients had MI resulted from leukemia, lymphoma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). MI group had higher SUVmaxBM than non-MI group (6.7+/-3.1 vs 4.2+/-0.9, p=0.001). However, a considerable proportion of MI patients had similar SUVmaxBM to non-MI patients, which were mainly seen in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and multiple myeloma (MM). There were significant differences in other factors between the two groups. MI patients were highly associated with SUVmaxAP/AX>/=1 (the ratio of SUVmaxBM of appendicular skeleton to that of axial skeleton), hepatosplenomegaly, older age and lower rate of fever. The decision tree combining SUVmaxBM, SUVmaxAP/AX, fever and hepatosplenomegaly achieved a sensitivity of 81.0%, a specificity of 98.4% and an accuracy of 94.0% for predicting MI. Conclusion: Increased diffuse BM (18)F-FDG uptake can be attributed to both bone marrow MI and benign etiologies. A decision tree based on C5.0 algorithm, combining PET/CT imaging and clinical features, is of potential use in discriminating BM malignant infiltration from patients with increased diffuse BM uptake.","['Zhou, Mingge', 'Chen, Yumei', 'Liu, Jianjun', 'Huang, Gang']","['Zhou M', 'Chen Y', 'Liu J', 'Huang G']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Cancer Metabolism, Institute of Health Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Lab.

An MTT assay following silibinin treatment demonstrated an inhibitory effect on AsPC-1 and SW1990 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Propidium iodide staining analysis identified the cell cycle arrest of G1 phase and western blotting analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E2, cyclin A and cyclin B1 were decreased. The expression of G1-associated cell cycle-dependent kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and CDK6, were also decreased, whereas the expression of p15 (p15(INK4B)) was increased. In addition, after SW1990 cells were incubated with various concentrations of silibinin, early and late apoptotic cells were detected using flow cytometry. Silibinin increased the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and subsequent cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was also observed. The expression levels of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, Bcl-2-like 1 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 were decreased, whereas the expression of Bcl-like protein 4 did not alter and the expression levels of Bcl-2-like 1 small and Bcl-2-like protein 11 were increased. The expression levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phospho-JNK were also increased.

However, the number of studies conducted to date on DHFR expression in childhood ALL is limited. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the expression of DHFR is associated with survival in childhood ALL. The expression of DHFR in 96 children with ALL and 100 control individuals was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of DHFR mRNA in children with ALL was significantly increased (P<0.001), compared with that in the control group. In addition, increased levels of DHFR mRNA were observed in patients with B-cell lineage, compared with patients with T-cell lineage ALL (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis revealed that children with ALL who exhibited increased levels of DHFR mRNA had a decreased overall survival time (P<0.05). It was observed that certain patient prognostic features (including age, sex, white blood cell count and high DHFR expression), are associated with poor survival (log-rank test, P<0.05). Therefore, the results of the present study indicated that DHFR upregulation is a factor for poor survival in ALL.","['Organista-Nava, Jorge', 'Gomez-Gomez, Yazmin', 'Illades-Aguiar, Berenice', 'Rivera-Ramirez, Ana Bertha', 'Saavedra-Herrera, Monica Virginia', 'Leyva-Vazquez, Marco Antonio']","['Organista-Nava J', 'Gomez-Gomez Y', 'Illades-Aguiar B', 'Rivera-Ramirez AB', 'Saavedra-Herrera MV', 'Leyva-Vazquez MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine, School of Chemical-Biological Sciences, Guerrero State University, Chilpancingo, Guerrero 39090, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine, School of Chemical-Biological Sciences, Guerrero State University, Chilpancingo, Guerrero 39090, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine, School of Chemical-Biological Sciences, Guerrero State University, Chilpancingo, Guerrero 39090, Mexico.', 'Research Department, State Cancer Institute, Arturo Beltran Ortega, Acapulco, Guerrero 39570, Mexico.', 'Research Department, State Cancer Institute, Arturo Beltran Ortega, Acapulco, Guerrero 39570, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine, School of Chemical-Biological Sciences, Guerrero State University, Chilpancingo, Guerrero 39090, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180404,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'dihydrofolate reductase', 'prognosis', 'survival']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/05/29 06:01,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2017/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2018.8429 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-8429 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2018 Jun;15(6):8405-8411. doi: 10.3892/ol.2018.8429.

Aberrant phenotype expression due to genetic defects may be associated with unfavorable outcome. It can be used to determine minimal residual disease status. The purpose of the study was to find out the occurrence of aberrant phenotypes in leukemia/lymphoma patients. Methods: One milliliter peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were analyzed on FACS Calibur flowcytometer. The cells were lysed and stained following standard protocol. Data was acquired and analyzed by CellQuest-Pro software. The Antigenic expression was rated as positive when the percentage of positive blast cells was >/= 20%. In that manner, aberrant phenotype was considered positive when 20% of blast cells show expression of markers. Results: Of a total 145 cases analyzed, 26 were acute myeloid leukemia, 71 of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 48 were of Chronic Lymphoid leukemia on the basis of morphological features and confirmed by flow cytometry. Overall, 19% (28) cases showed aberrant expression of antigens. In 32% (9/28) AML patients, CD5, CD7, CD64dim, CD10, CD117, CD25 and TdT were expressed while in 25% (7/28) ALL patients CD33, CD13, HLA-DR and CD3 were detected. Among chronic leukemia, all aberrant expressions were seen in cases of B-CLL (10/28) only; with CD11c, CD3 and CD10 as the aberrantly expressed markers. Conclusion: Variability in aberrant phenotype expression was observed in different types of acute and chronic leukemia patients with no prognostic implications on treatment response.","['Shahni, Aneeta', 'Saud, Madiha', 'Siddiqui, Saima', 'Mukry, Samina Naz']","['Shahni A', 'Saud M', 'Siddiqui S', 'Mukry SN']","['Aneeta Shahni, BS (Clinical Laboratory Sciences).

Although, it is known that increase in the activity of beta-catenin is important in blast transformation and drug resistance, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, changes in the expression levels of 186 genes that are thought to be important in drug resistance and Wnt signaling pathways were determined by using qPCR method in doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant HeLa and K562 cell lines. It has been observed that the genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathways are involved in more changes in HeLa/Dox cells (36 genes) than in the K562/Dox cells (17 genes). Genes important for the development of cancer resistance have been found to be significantly different in expression levels of 18 genes in HeLa/Dox cells and 20 genes in K562/Dox cells. In both cell lines, the expression of ABCB1 gene was significantly increased to 160 and 103 fold, respectively. However, despite the resistance to same drug in HeLa and K562 cell lines, it appears that the expression levels of different oncogenes and genes involved in Wnt signaling pathways have been altered. It has been found that although resistance develops to the same drug in both cell lines, the expression levels of different genes have changed. If functional analysis of these genes is performed on patient population groups, these molecules may become candidates for novel therapeutic target molecules.","['Mutlu, Pelin', 'Yalcin Azarkan, Serap', 'Taghavi Pourianazar, Negar', 'Yucel, Meral', 'Gunduz, Ufuk']","['Mutlu P', 'Yalcin Azarkan S', 'Taghavi Pourianazar N', 'Yucel M', 'Gunduz U']","['Central Laboratory Molecular Biology and Biotechnology R&D, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Ahi Evran University, Kirsehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Central Laboratory Molecular Biology and Biotechnology R&D, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180502,Germany,EXCLI J,EXCLI journal,101299402,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt signaling pathway', 'cervical cancer', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'gene expression']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/05/29 06:01,['2018/05/29 06:00'],"['2018/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.17179/excli2018-1129 [doi]', '2018-1129 [pii]', 'Doc386 [pii]']",epublish,EXCLI J. 2018 May 2;17:386-398. doi: 10.17179/excli2018-1129. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5962902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD4 gene transduction into iPS-T cells enhanced b3a2 peptide-specific responses via b3a2 peptide-specific TCR. iPS-T cells upregulated CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression in response to interleukin-2 and interleukin-15. In the presence of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) peptide, antigen-specific dendritic cells (DCs) conditioned by CD4-modified CD40L(high) iPS-T cells stimulated WT1-specific CTL priming, which eliminated WT1 peptide-expressing CML cells in vitro and in vivo.

ADC development has aimed to target the specificity inherent in antigen-antibody interactions to deliver potent cytotoxins preferentially to tumor cells and maximize antitumor activity and simultaneously minimize off-target toxicity. The earliest ADCs provided disappointing results in the clinic; however, the lessons learned regarding the need for human or humanized antibodies, more stable linkers, and greater potency payloads led to improved ADCs. Three ADCs, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, brentuximab vedotin (BV), and inotuzumab ozogamicin, have been approved for hematologic malignancies. Site-specific conjugation methods have now resulted in a new generation of more uniform, molecularly defined ADCs. These are expected to display improved in vivo properties and have recently entered the clinic. We reviewed investigational ADCs currently in clinical testing for the treatment of B-cell lineage malignancies, including leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. The rationales for antigen targeting, data reported to date, current trial status, and preclinical results for several newer ADCs expected to enter first-in-human studies are presented. Owing to the large number of ongoing and reported BV clinical studies, only the studies of BV for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and those combining BV with checkpoint inhibitors in B-lineage malignancies have been reviewed.

S. aureus forms biofilms on these membranes and potentially causes chorioamnionitis in pregnant women. We report a case of persistent methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia owing to placental infection, causing chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. A 29-year-old Japanese woman at the 27th gestational week was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia and underwent all-trans retinoic acid therapy. Soon after hospitalization, the patient presented with persistent MRSA bacteremia of unknown origin. Despite various antimicrobial therapies, she experienced 12 MRSA bacteremia episodes over 6 weeks. However, after child birth, MRSA bacteremia disappeared without any complications. A pathologic examination of her placenta revealed placenta abscess, resulting in a diagnosis of MRSA-associated chorioamnionitis. Molecular analysis proved that a single MRSA strain (SCCmec Type IVa), which tested negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, caused the obstinate infection. We should be aware that persistent MRSA bacteremia in pregnant women can originate from placental abscess.","['Maeda, Naomi', 'Hagiya, Hideharu', 'Takiuchi, Tsuyoshi', 'Kusakabe, Shinsuke', 'Maeda, Tetsuo', 'Kimura, Keigo', 'Iwai, Sayuri', 'Kawasaki, Keisuke', 'Hori, Yumiko', 'Morii, Eiichi', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru', 'Kimura, Tadashi', 'Tomono, Kazunori']","['Maeda N', 'Hagiya H', 'Takiuchi T', 'Kusakabe S', 'Maeda T', 'Kimura K', 'Iwai S', 'Kawasaki K', 'Hori Y', 'Morii E', 'Kanakura Y', 'Kimura T', 'Tomono K']","['Division of Infection Control and Prevention, Osaka University Hospital, Japan.', 'Division of Infection Control and Prevention, Osaka University Hospital, Japan.

This study aimed to evaluate size-corrected BMD in leukaemia survivors treated with and without HSCT-TBI. METHODS: Childhood leukaemia survivors treated with HSCT-TBI (n = 35), aged 17.3 (10.5-20.9) years, were compared with those treated with chemotherapy only, (n = 16) aged 18.5 (16.1-20.9) years, and population references. Outcome measures included anthropometric measurements and BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD was corrected for size as bone mineral apparent density (BMAD). Statistical analysis was performed by 1- and 2-sample t tests as well as regression analysis (5% significance). RESULTS: HSCT-TBI survivors were lighter and shorter with reduced spinal heights compared with chemotherapy-only subjects and population references. Compared with population references, HSCT-TBI survivors showed lower BMD standard deviation scores (SDS) (p = 0.008), but no difference in BMAD-SDS, and chemotherapy-only survivors showed no differences in neither BMD-SDS nor BMAD-SDS. All HSCT-TBI participants with BMD-SDS <-2 had BMAD-SDS >-2. BMAD-SDS was negatively associated with age (r = -0.38, p = 0.029) in HSCT-TBI survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Size-corrected BMD are normal in HSCT-TBI survivors in young adulthood, but may reduce overtime. BMD measurements should be corrected for size in these patients to be clinically meaningful.","['Wei, Christina', 'Candler, Toby', 'Davis, Nikki', 'Elson, Ruth', 'Crabtree, Nicola', 'Stevens, Michael', 'Crowne, Elizabeth']","['Wei C', 'Candler T', 'Davis N', 'Elson R', 'Crabtree N', 'Stevens M', 'Crowne E']","['Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', ""St George's University, NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom."", 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital Southampton, NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', ""Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom."", 'University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180525,Switzerland,Horm Res Paediatr,Hormone research in paediatrics,101525157,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', '*Bone Density', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bone mineral density', 'Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Leukaemia', 'Long-term survivors', 'Total body irradiation']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/05/28 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['000487996 [pii]', '10.1159/000487996 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res Paediatr. 2018;89(4):246-254. doi: 10.1159/000487996.

Obviously, anemia is developed in many patients receiving dasatinib for treatment. Until now, the mechanism for the cytotoxic effects of dasatinib in human erythrocytes is not fully understood. As many tyrosine kinases are found in human erythrocytes, it is therefore logical to hypothesize that dasatinib is able to induce apoptosis (or eryptosis) in human erythrocytes. True to our expectation, dasatinib inhibited tyrosine kinase and induced eryptosis in human erythrocytes with early denature of esterase, cell shrinkage, loss of membrane integrity with inside-out phosphatidylserine, increase in the cytosolic Ca(2+) ion concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), caspase-3 activation and change in cellular redox state. Mechanistically, the rise of [Ca(2+)]i seems to be a key mediator in the dasatinib-mediated eryptosis because depletion of external Ca(2+) could suppress the eryptotic effects. Also, dasatinib was able to reduce membrane fluidity in human RBCs. For the direct action on membrane, dasatinib permeabilized RBC ghosts in a way similar to digitonin. Taken together, we report here for the first time that dasatinib inhibited tyrosine kinase and induced eryptosis in human erythrocytes through Ca(2+) loading and membrane permeabilization.","['Chan, Wai Yin', 'Lau, Pui Man', 'Yeung, Ka Wing', 'Kong, Siu Kai']","['Chan WY', 'Lau PM', 'Yeung KW', 'Kong SK']","['Programme of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', 'Programme of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', 'Programme of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', 'Programme of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.

DTF consisted of an anti-IL-17A single chain variable fragment, a soluble TNF receptor 1, and an Fc fragment. Both clinical and histopathological evaluations suggest that DTF and etanercept can ameliorate collagen induced arthritis. However, the arthritis severity score of DTF-treated mice was lower than that of etanercept-treated mice. In addition, DTF was more potent than etanercept in decreasing the ratio of RANKL/OPG in the serum and rebalancing the population ratio of Treg/Th17 cells in the spleens. In vitro, IL-17A and TNF-alpha had synergistic effects in inducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines in fibroblast-like synoviocyte from RA patients (RA-FLS), human leukemia (THP-1), and rheumatoid synovial fibroblast (MH7A). IL-17A and TNF-alpha also had synergistic effects in inducing proliferation and migration of MH7A cells. However, we observed that DTF was more efficient than etanercept in suppressing these synergistic effects. Our results demonstrate that DTF is highly efficient in the treatment of arthritis and has the potential to overcome the limited therapeutic responses obtained with single cytokine neutralization.","['Liu, Zhihang', 'Song, Liying', 'Wang, Yunxin', 'Xu, Pengfei', 'Guo, Xiaochen', 'Yang, Jiarui', 'Liu, Han', 'Wang, Yuyang', 'Wu, Chao', 'Zhang, Teng', 'Yu, Dan', 'Opoku, Yeboah Kwaku', 'Khoso, Mir Hassan', 'Ren, Guiping', 'Li, Deshan']","['Liu Z', 'Song L', 'Wang Y', 'Xu P', 'Guo X', 'Yang J', 'Liu H', 'Wang Y', 'Wu C', 'Zhang T', 'Yu D', 'Opoku YK', 'Khoso MH', 'Ren G', 'Li D']","['Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China; Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biological Functional Gene, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.', 'Bio-pharmaceutical Lab, College of Life Sciences, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China; Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biological Functional Gene, Harbin 150030, China.

Given that myeloablative conditioning (MAC) is more effective at preventing disease relapse, we compared outcomes of patients receiving MAC and RIC regimens. We evaluated overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of 148 patients that underwent haplo-HCT with either MAC (n = 61) or RIC (n = 87). Propensity score adjustment (PSA) was used to balance baseline characteristics between groups and more effectively compare outcomes based on conditioning intensity. After the PSA analysis, relapse was significantly decreased with MAC (hazard ratio [HR], .47; 95% confidence interval [CI], .31 to .70), but was associated with higher NRM (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.67). OS and DFS were not significantly different between groups (HRs for MAC versus RIC were .87 [95% CI, .64 to 1.18] and .90 [95% CI, .68 to 1.18] for OS and DFS, respectively). Rates of acute and chronic GVHD were not significantly different between groups. This analysis suggests that both MAC and RIC regimens are effective in haplo-HCT and that MAC regimens may result in less relapse in selected patients. These results need to be verified in a larger registry study.","['Huselton, Eric', 'Slade, Michael', 'Trinkaus, Kathryn M', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Romee, Rizwan']","['Huselton E', 'Slade M', 'Trinkaus KM', 'DiPersio JF', 'Westervelt P', 'Romee R']","['BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Biostatistics Shared Resource, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

Known predictive and prognostic factors in AML include age, performance status, comorbidities, cytogenetics, and molecular mutations. Identifying prognostic and predictive factors can inform the choice of induction therapy and outcomes prediction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 137 adult AML patients from 2010 to 2015. Predictors of complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS) were determined for patients treated with 3+7 (3 days of anthracycline and 7 days of cytarabine) or hypomethylating agent. Variables associated with CR or OS were assessed using univariate Cox regression and a multivariate Cox model. RESULTS: The average age was 65 years and 91 patients (66%), sample size is 137 patients had primary AML. Patients in the 3+7 induction group were younger, had a higher bone marrow blast percentage, and more de novo AML compared with those in the hypomethylating agent group (P < .001, P < .001, P = .005, respectively). Univariate logistic regression for CR showed a significant association between age (P < .001), choice of induction (P < .001), and monosomy (P = .015), although only induction with 3+7 (P < .001) and absence of monosomy (P = .042) remained significant in multivariate analysis. Univariate Cox regression indicated that age (P = .003), AML status (de novo or secondary; P = .0277), choice of induction (P = .030), and monosomy (P = .010) had a significant association with OS. Only younger age (P = .018) and absence of monosomy (P = .022) were predictive of OS in multivariate Cox analysis. CONCLUSION: Positive predictors of CR in adult AML include absence of monosomy and induction treatment with 3+7; whereas positive predictors of OS are younger age and absence of monosomy.","['Gbadamosi, Bolanle', 'Ezekwudo, Daniel', 'Bastola, Sanjog', 'Jaiyesimi, Ishmael']","['Gbadamosi B', 'Ezekwudo D', 'Bastola S', 'Jaiyesimi I']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Beaumont Hospital, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Royal Oak, MI.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in NR3C1 encoding for protein involved in the GCs metabolism and its role in the development of ALL and the toxicity outcome, in terms of liver toxicity, glucose abnormality and infections, in ALL Saudi children. Methods: The following polymorphisms BCII rs41423247, ER22/23 EK rs6189 and rs6190 and N363S rs6195 in NR3C1 were analyzed in 70 children with ALL treated according to the ALL 2000 study protocol in comparison to 60 control subjects. Treatment toxicities and their association with genotypes were evaluated according to Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC). Results: This study demonstrated that the NR3C1 did not contribute to the development of childhood ALL. Homozygous ER22/23EK polymorphism was not found in both ALL patients and in control group whereas the heterozygous polymorphism was only observed in the control group (6.66%). The toxicology data in this study showed a significant difference between ALL patients carrying N363S polymorphism and wild type (40% and 6.51% respectively, P= 0.009) and a high-risk factor in the toxicity of glucose abnormality (OR=10.167; 1.302-79.339). BCII shows increased risk factors towards the liver toxicity (OR=2.667; 0.526-7.330) as well as the glucose abnormality (OR=7.5; 1.039-54.116). Conclusion: This study suggested that the polymorphisms in NR3C1 were not associated with the development of ALL in children. N363S polymorphism was sensitive to glucocorticoids and it may contribute to the glucose abnormality for these patients.","['El-Fayoumi, Refaat', 'Hagras, Magda', 'Abozenadaha, Adel', 'Bawazir, Waleed', 'Shinawi, Thoraia']","['El-Fayoumi R', 'Hagras M', 'Abozenadaha A', 'Bawazir W', 'Shinawi T']","['Medical laboratory Technology Department, Faculty of Applied medical Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah , Saudi Arabi.

It has been previously reported that only late-stage B cell precursors circulate in the peripheral blood. Consequently, flow cytometric detection of cells with immunophenotypic findings similar to earlier stage precursors in the peripheral blood justifiably raises concern for involvement by B-lymphoblastic leukaemia. We report here, however, that benign early B cell precursors can indeed be detected in the peripheral blood, thus complicating the interpretation of flow cytometric findings derived from these sample types. A retrospective search of our collective databases identified 13 cases containing circulating early stage B cell precursors. The patients ranged in age from 15 days to 85 years old. All positive cases demonstrated that the earlier B cell precursors were associated with later stage precursors, a finding that could help differentiate these cells from B-lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Kurzer, Jason H', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Kurzer JH', 'Weinberg OK']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180525,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['flow cytometry', 'hematopathology', 'leukaemia']",2018/05/29 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2018/05/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2018-205172 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2018-205172 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2018 Sep;71(9):845-850. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2018-205172.

DIS3 is a highly conserved exoribonuclease, also known as Rrp44. Global sequencing studies have identified DIS3 as being mutated in a range of cancers, with a considerable incidence in multiple myeloma. In this work, we have identified two protein-coding isoforms of DIS3. Both isoforms are functionally relevant and result from alternative splicing. They differ from each other in the size of their N-terminal PIN (PilT N-terminal) domain, which has been shown to have endoribonuclease activity and tether DIS3 to the exosome. Isoform 1 encodes a full-length PIN domain, whereas the PIN domain of isoform 2 is shorter and is missing a segment with conserved amino acids. We have carried out biochemical activity assays on both isoforms of full-length DIS3 and the isolated PIN domains. We find that isoform 2, despite missing part of the PIN domain, has greater endonuclease activity compared with isoform 1. Examination of the available structural information allows us to provide a hypothesis to explain this altered behaviour. Our results also show that multiple myeloma patient cells and all cancer cell lines tested have higher levels of isoform 1 compared with isoform 2, whereas acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia patient cells and samples from healthy donors have similar levels of isoforms 1 and 2. Taken together, our data indicate that significant changes in the ratios of the two isoforms could be symptomatic of haematological cancers.","['Robinson, Sophie R', 'Viegas, Sandra C', 'Matos, Rute G', 'Domingues, Susana', 'Bedir, Marisa', 'Stewart, Helen J S', 'Chevassut, Timothy J', 'Oliver, Antony W', 'Arraiano, Cecilia M', 'Newbury, Sarah F']","['Robinson SR', 'Viegas SC', 'Matos RG', 'Domingues S', 'Bedir M', 'Stewart HJS', 'Chevassut TJ', 'Oliver AW', 'Arraiano CM', 'Newbury SF']","['Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, U.K.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'School of Life Sciences, Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RQ, U.K.', 'Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, U.K.', 'Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, U.K.', 'School of Life Sciences, Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RQ, U.K.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Medical Research Building, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PS, U.K. s.newbury@bsms.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180629,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CMML', '*DIS3', '*PIN domain', '*RNA stability', '*myeloma']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/05/27 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['BCJ20170962 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20170962 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2018 Jun 29;475(12):2091-2105. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20170962.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex)', 'EC 3.1.13.- (DIS3 protein, human)']",,PMC6024818,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2912-8273', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1863-3258']",['(c) 2018 The Author(s).'],"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'C/302/A24386/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'BB/P021042/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the median age at diagnosis is 67 years, with approximately one third of patients aged 75 years or older, limited treatment options exist for the elderly, who have 5-year survival rates of only 5%. A systematic review was conducted to examine effectiveness and safety outcomes of treatment regimens in elderly (>/=60 years old) patients with AML. Published literature on the topic was scant, and the review included only 22 articles examining outcomes. Twelve studies examined treatment-specific outcomes; most of these examined azacitidine or intensive chemotherapy (IC). An international randomized controlled trial found that azacitidine significantly improved overall survival relative to conventional regimens including IC and low-dose cytarabine in patients aged > 65 years. Similar results in favor of azacitidine were demonstrated in 2 other studies. IC was generally associated with longer survival versus lower-intensity therapy or best supportive care. Findings suggest that azacitidine is a viable option for elderly AML patients who are ineligible for IC, and emerging agents used in combination with azacitidine could have a major impact in this difficult-to-treat population.","['Bell, Jill A', 'Galaznik, Aaron', 'Huelin, Rachel', 'Stokes, Michael', 'Guo, Yelan', 'Fram, Robert J', 'Faller, Douglas V']","['Bell JA', 'Galaznik A', 'Huelin R', 'Stokes M', 'Guo Y', 'Fram RJ', 'Faller DV']","['Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA.

Therapy for CLL is guided according to the Rai and Binet staging systems. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art protocols in disease monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics for CLL are based on the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). MRD is internationally considered to be the level of disease that can be detected by sensitive techniques and represents incomplete treatment and a probability of disease relapse. MRD detection has been continuously improved by the quick development of both flow cytometry and molecular biology technology, as well as by next-generation sequencing. Considering that MRD detection is moving more and more from research to clinical practice, where it can be an independent prognostic marker, in this paper, we present the methodologies by which MRD is evaluated, from translational research to clinical practice.","['Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Selicean, Cristina', 'Cismas, Sonia', 'Jurj, Anca', 'Marian, Mirela', 'Dima, Delia', 'Pasca, Sergiu', 'Petrushev, Bobe', 'Moisoiu, Vlad', 'Micu, Wilhelm-Thomas', 'Vischer, Anna', 'Arifeen, Kanza', 'Selicean, Sonia', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Tanase, Alina', 'Grewal, Ravnit', 'Pop, Laura', 'Aanei, Carmen', 'Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana']","['Tomuleasa C', 'Selicean C', 'Cismas S', 'Jurj A', 'Marian M', 'Dima D', 'Pasca S', 'Petrushev B', 'Moisoiu V', 'Micu WT', 'Vischer A', 'Arifeen K', 'Selicean S', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Bumbea H', 'Tanase A', 'Grewal R', 'Pop L', 'Aanei C', 'Berindan-Neagoe I']","['a Department of Hematology , Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'b Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine/Hematology , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'a Department of Hematology , Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'c Department of Genetics , Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Timisoara , Romania.', 'd Department of Hematology , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'a Department of Hematology , Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'a Department of Hematology , Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'd Department of Hematology , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'd Department of Hematology , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'd Department of Hematology , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'a Department of Hematology , Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'd Department of Hematology , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'f Department of Hematology , Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Bucharest , Romania.', 'g Department of Hematology , University Clinical Hospital , Bucharest , Romania.', 'h Department of Stem Cell Transplantation , Fundeni Clinical Institute , Bucharest , Romania.', 'i South African Medical Research Council Bioinformatics Unit , The South African National Bioinformatics Institute (SANBI), University of the Western Cape , Bellville , South Africa.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.', 'j Hematology Laboratory, Pole de Biologie-Pathologie , University Hospital of St. Etienne , St. Etienne , France.', 'e Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine , Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , Cluj Napoca , Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180525,England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Consensus', 'Flow Cytometry', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', '*Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*clinical relevance', '*minimal residual disease']",2018/05/29 06:00,2019/03/05 06:00,['2018/05/27 06:00'],"['2018/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408363.2018.1463508 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2018 Aug;55(5):329-345. doi: 10.1080/10408363.2018.1463508.

It is important to investigate the use of MSP among childhood cancer patients because pediatric oncology is a high-risk area for potentially harmful adverse events. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the implementation of MSP in chemotherapy on the incidence of medication errors in childhood ALL patient at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, including in 1) transcribing, 2) administering, 3) monitoring, 4) the incidence of adverse drugs events. (ADEs). Methods: The study design is a quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-intervention without control. The sample consists of ALL patients who are taken care of at an academic hospital in Indonesia from 2012 to 2013. The sample was consecutively collected during the period of study. The data were collected through medical records, research form, observation, and discussion with the nurse. The intervention given is training and implementation of medical safety practice in chemotherapy. Result: Based on the analysis of the effect of the implementation of MSP (75 and 106 medical records of pre- and post-intervention), it is obtained: 1) the adherence of chemotherapy transcribing post-intervention increases significantly compared to pre-intervention (p<0.05), 2) the adherence of chemotherapy administering increases significantly in almost every aspect (p<0.05), except in preparing drugs by two different health worker, patient's confirmation of ADEs management, and verification of drug's expired date, 3) The adherence of chemotherapy monitoring improved significantly post-intervention (p<0.05), 4) Adverse Drug Events (ADE) decreased significantly post-intervention (p<0.05), from 52.1% to 30.5%. Conclusion: The implementation of MSP decreased the incidence of medication errors in ALL patients at Dr. Sardjito Hospital in ordering, dispensing, transcribing, administering, and monitoring chemotherapy. It also reduced the incidence of ADEs related to chemotherapy. Specific training for nurses are needed in order to improve the knowledge and skills, especially for medication error and skill in patients' care.","['Mulatsih, Sri', 'Dwiprahasto, Iwan', 'Sutaryo']","['Mulatsih S', 'Dwiprahasto I', 'Sutaryo']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada/ Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 418 IM first-line treated CP-CML patients followed in three reference centers over 15years in and outside of clinical trials, which is believed to represent the ""real-life"" care of such patients. Molecular analyses were standardized over the years. In case of intolerance or resistance or IM cessation and progression, all clinical data were collected and analyzed. After a median follow-up of 83 months (range 1-194), the overall survival (OS) rates were 91% and 82%, the progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 88.5% and 81%, and the event-free survival rates, including switching to another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were 65% and 51%, respectively, at 5 and 10years. Thirteen patients (3%) entered blast crisis (BC) with a median survival of 2.2years after BC onset. Forty-nine percent of patients were in major molecular response at 1 year. Univariate analysis failed to detect any impact on survival of molecular response at 3 and 6 months. Sokal score had a significant impact on OS and PFS in a Cox model. Age had a significant impact on OS and PFS, mainly due to deaths in elderly patients unrelated to CML. Overall, 21% of patients reached a stable (>/=1 year) molecular response 4 (MR4) and 6.5% reached MR4.5. At last follow-up, 63% of patients were still on IM and 19% were in treatment-free remission.

Specific to the management of leukemia, coordination may occur between primary care physician, medical and radiation oncologists, surgeons, cardiologists, and genetics specialists. Experiencing gaps in communication and care coordination, many health consumers seek instrumental support in their social circles, including online forums and networks. The goal of this theory-guided study was to provide an in-depth assessment of how individuals use online forums to deliberate about their goals and plans for leukemia care coordination. Guided by the planning theory of communication, the data were collected from the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network and included 125 original posts and 1,248 responses. Thematic analysis and axial coding were applied to analyze the data. Goal-related themes included overcoming the diffusion of care coordination and achieving health management cohesion. Planning themes included social health management, communication self-efficacy, and role deliberation. Online patient forums provide an interactive platform for patients and caregivers to engage in active conversations, which in turn can serve as identifiers of care coordination needs. Communication with those who share similar experiences allows cancer patients and survivors to accumulate functional health literacy, gain communication self-efficacy, and articulate a care coordination role acceptable to them.","['Strekalova, Yulia A', 'Hawkins, Kimberly E', 'Drusbosky, Leylah M', 'Cogle, Cristopher R']","['Strekalova YA', 'Hawkins KE', 'Drusbosky LM', 'Cogle CR']","['College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Transl Behav Med,Translational behavioral medicine,101554668,IM,"['Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Disease Management', '*Goals', 'Health Communication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Social Media']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['5001931 [pii]', '10.1093/tbm/ibx075 [doi]']",ppublish,Transl Behav Med. 2018 May 23;8(3):481-491. doi: 10.1093/tbm/ibx075.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 14 ALV strains were isolated and identified, including two ALV-A strains, one ALV-B strain, eight ALV-J strains, and three ALV-K strains. To study the genome structure, biological characteristics, and the evolutionary relationships of the ALV-K strains with other known subgroup strains from infected chickens, we determined the complete genome sequence of the three ALV-K strains and performed comparative analysis using the whole genome sequence or selected sequence elements. The replication rates of the three ALV-K strains were markedly lower than the rates of other ALVs, and they shared a common mutation in the pol gene, which had not been previously observed. In addition, nine putative recombinant events were detected in the genomes of the three newly isolated ALV-K strains, with high statistical support. This was the first report of an ALV-K reorganization event, which has contributed to its genetic evolution. In summary, we established a robust classification system for ALV, especially for ALV-K, and revealed additional genomic diversity for the ALV strains in indigenous chicken breeds. Therefore additional works are warranted to explore ALV genomics and epidemiology.","['Su, Qi', 'Li, Yang', 'Li, Weihua', 'Cui, Shuai', 'Tian, Sibao', 'Cui, Zhizhong', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Chang, Shuang']","['Su Q', 'Li Y', 'Li W', 'Cui S', 'Tian S', 'Cui Z', 'Zhao P', 'Chang S']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China."", 'China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, Qingdao, 266032, China.', 'China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, Qingdao, 266032, China.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention Tai'an, 271018, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*genetics', '*Chickens', 'China', 'Gene Products, pol/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/virology']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)30829-6 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pex367 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2018 Aug 1;97(8):2917-2925. doi: 10.3382/ps/pex367.,"['0 (Gene Products, pol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To determine the risk of VTE in patients with KC compared with patients not diagnosed with cancer and with patients diagnosed with common malignant neoplasms associated with VTE. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective analysis of patient insurance claims made between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2014, from the Truven MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. Patients treated across the United States were divided into 3 cohorts: patients with KC, patients with pancreatic cancer or acute myelogenous leukemia who are thus at high risk for VTE, and patients without a history of common malignant neoplasms. Patients were excluded from the KC cohort if they had a history of another type of cancer. Data were analyzed between April 1, 2017, and January 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Diagnosis of VTE within 1 year following the index date (for the KC and high-risk cohorts, the date of the initial diagnosis of cancer; for the control cohort, the date following 365 days of continuous insurance enrollment). Logistic regression was used to assess the risk of VTE in the KC cohort compared with the high-risk and control cohorts before and after matching across patient characteristics and known risk factors for VTE. Results: Of 5753613 potentially eligible patients, the final sample consisted of 740246 patients (12.8%) across 3 cohorts. Of the 740246 study participants, 417839 were in the KC cohort (223986 [53.6%] men, mean [SD] age, 64.2 [13.6] years); 314736 were in the control cohort (135203 [43.0%] men, 42.9 [15.2] years); and 7671 were in the high-risk cohort (3502 [45.7%] men, 59.4 [14.4] years) The risk of VTE in the KC cohort was lower compared with the high-risk cohort in univariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.20-0.23; P < .001), multivariable analysis (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.26-0.32; P < .001), and after matching across patient characteristics and known risk factors (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.78; P = .001). The risk of VTE in the KC cohort was higher in the univariable analysis (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.23-2.41; P < .001), lower in the multivariable analysis (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.90; P < .001), and not different after matching of patient characteristics and risk factors (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.01; P = .08) than that of the control cohort. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study provided no evidence supporting the increased risk of VTE in the KC cohort compared with the control cohort. Given the inherent risks of chemoprophylaxis, the need for prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with KC who are scheduled for surgery should be carefully considered.

An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization-TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells. METHODS: We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy.","['Hernandez, Mariel J', 'Dos Reis, Luciene M', 'Marques, Igor D', 'Araujo, Maria J', 'Truyts, Cesar A M', 'Oliveira, Ivone B', 'Barreto, Fellype C', 'David-Neto, Elias', 'Custodio, Melani R', 'Moyses, Rosa M', 'Bellorin-Font, Ezequiel', 'Jorgetti, Vanda']","['Hernandez MJ', 'Dos Reis LM', 'Marques ID', 'Araujo MJ', 'Truyts CAM', 'Oliveira IB', 'Barreto FC', 'David-Neto E', 'Custodio MR', 'Moyses RM', 'Bellorin-Font E', 'Jorgetti V']","['LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Servicio de Nefrologia y Trasplante Renal, Hospital Universitario de Caracas, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Urologia, Hospital das Clinicas, HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Nefrologia, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Urologia, Hospital das Clinicas, HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Medicina, Universidade Nove de Julho (UNINOVE), Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Servicio de Nefrologia y Trasplante Renal, Hospital Universitario de Caracas, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela.', 'LIM 16 - Laboratorio de Fisiopatologia Renal, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Hospital Samaritano Americas Servicos Medicos, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180525,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adiposity/*drug effects', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Bone Remodeling/drug effects', 'Calcification, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult', 'Zoledronic Acid']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197994 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-23527 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 25;13(5):e0197994. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197994. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",,PMC5969759,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4824-8879'],,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poly-chemotherapy with cytotoxic and genotoxic drugs causes substantial toxicity and more specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular lesions are highly desired. Perturbed Ras signaling is prevalent in T-ALL and occurs via oncogenic RAS mutations or through overexpression of the Ras activator RasGRP1 in ~65% of T-ALL patients. Effective small molecule inhibitors for either target do not currently exist. Genetic and biochemical evidence link phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signals to T-ALL, PI3Ks are activated by Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms, and potent PI3K inhibitors exist. Here we performed comprehensive analyses of PI3K-Akt signaling in T-ALL with a focus on class I PI3K. We developed a multiplex, multiparameter flow cytometry platform with pan- and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors. We find that pan-PI3K and PI3K gamma-specific inhibitors effectively block basal and cytokine-induced PI3K-Akt signals. Despite such inhibition, GDC0941 (pan-PI3K) or AS-605240 (PI3Kgamma-specific) as single agents did not efficiently induce death in T-ALL cell lines. Combination of GDC0941 with AS-605240, maximally targeting all p110 isoforms, exhibited potent synergistic activity for clonal T-ALL lines in vitro, which motivated us to perform preclinical trials in mice. In contrast to clonal T-ALL lines, we used a T-ALL cancer model that recapitulates the multi-step pathogenesis and inter- and intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity, a hallmark of advanced human cancers. We found that the combination of GDC0941 with AS-605240 fails in such trials. Our results reveal that PI3K inhibitors are a promising avenue for molecular therapy in T-ALL, but predict the requirement for methods that can resolve biochemical signals in heterogeneous cell populations so that combination therapy can be designed in a rational manner.","['Ksionda, Olga', 'Mues, Marsilius', 'Wandler, Anica M', 'Donker, Lisa', 'Tenhagen, Milou', 'Jun, Jesse', 'Ducker, Gregory S', 'Matlawska-Wasowska, Ksenia', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Shokat, Kevan M', 'Roose, Jeroen P']","['Ksionda O', 'Mues M', 'Wandler AM', 'Donker L', 'Tenhagen M', 'Jun J', 'Ducker GS', 'Matlawska-Wasowska K', 'Shannon K', 'Shokat KM', 'Roose JP']","['Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of New Mexico, Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180525,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2018/07/31 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0193849 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-40207 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 25;13(5):e0193849. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193849. eCollection 2018.,"['0', '(2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-ylth', 'ieno(3,2-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,PMC5969748,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4746-2811'],,"['R01 AI099245/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 - CA187318 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 - HL120724/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA187318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1AI099245 /NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL120724/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['KMS is an inventor on the UCSF patent US 7,585,868 B2 covering INK128, which is', 'licensed to Takeda Pharmaceuticals.

High-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules, including high-content analysis (HCA), has been an important technology for the discovery of molecular tools and new therapeutics. HTS can be based on modulation of a known disease target (called reverse chemical genetics) or modulation of a disease-associated mechanism or phenotype (forward chemical genetics). Prominent target-based successes include modulators of transthyretin, used to treat transthyretin amyloidoses, and the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor Gleevec, used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. Phenotypic screening successes include modulators of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, splicing correctors for spinal muscular atrophy, and histone deacetylase inhibitors for cancer. Synthetic lethal screening, in which chemotherapeutics are screened for efficacy against specific genetic backgrounds, is a promising approach that merges phenotype and target. In this article, we introduce HTS technology and highlight its contributions to the discovery of drugs and probes for monogenic diseases and cancer.","['Markossian, Sarine', 'Ang, Kenny K', 'Wilson, Christopher G', 'Arkin, Michelle R']","['Markossian S', 'Ang KK', 'Wilson CG', 'Arkin MR']","['Small Molecule Discovery Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA; email: sarine.markossian@ucsf.edu , kean-hooi.ang@ucsf.edu , chris.wilson2@ucsf.edu , michelle.arkin@ucsf.edu.', 'Small Molecule Discovery Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA; email: sarine.markossian@ucsf.edu , kean-hooi.ang@ucsf.edu , chris.wilson2@ucsf.edu , michelle.arkin@ucsf.edu.', 'Small Molecule Discovery Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA; email: sarine.markossian@ucsf.edu , kean-hooi.ang@ucsf.edu , chris.wilson2@ucsf.edu , michelle.arkin@ucsf.edu.', 'Small Molecule Discovery Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA; email: sarine.markossian@ucsf.edu , kean-hooi.ang@ucsf.edu , chris.wilson2@ucsf.edu , michelle.arkin@ucsf.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180523,United States,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet,Annual review of genomics and human genetics,100911346,IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/*drug therapy', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HCA', '*HTS', '*cancer', '*drug discovery', '*high-content analysis', '*high-throughput screening', '*monogenic disease', '*small molecules']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev-genom-083117-021452 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. 2018 Aug 31;19:263-288. doi: 10.1146/annurev-genom-083117-021452.

We have shown earlier that RASFs exhibit resistance to apoptosis, primarily as a result of enhanced expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). In this study, we discovered that ursolic acid (UA), a plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid, selectively induces B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3-only protein Noxa in human RASFs. We observed that UA-induced Noxa expression was followed by a consequent decrease in Mcl-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent evaluation of the signaling pathways showed that UA-induced Noxa is primarily mediated by the JNK pathway in human RASFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) studies into the promoter region of Noxa indicated the role of transcription factor specificity protein 1 in JNK-mediated Noxa expression. Furthermore, the results from IP studies and proximity ligation assays indicated that UA-induced Noxa colocalizes and associates with Mcl-1 to prime it for proteasomal degradation through K(48)-linked ubiquitination by the selective recruitment of Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3, a homologous to E6-associated protein C terminus domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. These findings unveil a novel mechanism of inducing apoptosis in RASFs and a potential adjunct therapeutic strategy of regulating synovial hyperplasia in RA.-Kim, E. Y., Sudini, K., Singh, A.

METHODS: An integrated, closed-loop, pharmacy-led oral chemotherapy management program was established. From September 2014 until June 2015, demographic information, rates of adherence, patient understanding of treatment, pharmacist interventions, patient and provider satisfaction, and molecular response rates in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were collected. RESULTS: After full implementation, 107 patients were enrolled in our oral chemotherapy management program from September 2014 until June 2015. All patients were educated before starting oral chemotherapy, and using pre- and postassessment tests, comprehension of oral chemotherapy treatment increased from 43% to 95%. Patient-reported adherence was 86% and 94.7% for the GI/breast and malignant hematology patient populations, respectively, and these were validated with medication possession ratio, revealing adherence rates of 85% and 93.9% for the GI/breast and malignant hematology patient populations, respectively. A total of 350 encounters with a clinical pharmacist and 318 adverse effects were reported, which led to 235 interventions. This program led to a higher major molecular response rate (83%) in our CML population compared with published clinical trials (average major molecular response rates, 40% and 60% with 1- and 2-year follow-up, respectively). CONCLUSION: An innovative model was developed and resulted in improved patient knowledge regarding oral chemotherapy, improved adherence rates that exceeded nationally established thresholds, and superior major molecular response outcomes for patients with CML compared with published literature. As a result, this model has produced the gold standard in managing patients receiving oral chemotherapy.","['Muluneh, Benyam', 'Schneider, Molly', 'Faso, Aimee', 'Amerine, Lindsey', 'Daniels, Rowell', 'Crisp, Brett', 'Valgus, John', 'Savage, Scott']","['Muluneh B', 'Schneider M', 'Faso A', 'Amerine L', 'Daniels R', 'Crisp B', 'Valgus J', 'Savage S']","['University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill; UNC Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC; and Ralph H.

However, there are special conditions in which they are allowed to decide about their health. The greater the judgement and experience limitations in minors, the less weight is given to the values and objectives they express. Also, the more adverse consequences might be, the higher the level of authority that is demanded to decide on behalf of the minor, thus granting the State the capability to guarantee the well-being of the minor. Case report: 12-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with precarious social and family background; evolution of the disease obstructed by the disregard of the treatment due to her unsanitary and extreme poverty conditions. Both of her parents died soon after the start of the treatment and she was kept under the care of her half-sister of legal age. The work and the ethical dilemma of the pediatrician and the staff of Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez are exposed within the building of support -networks with the objective of prioritizing the minor's well-being, without allowing family break-up or disintegration, thus succeeding in her recovery.

By binding to Sp1 (specificity protein 1) sites on the DNA and interactions with other regulatory transcription factors, KLF10 encourages and suppresses the expression of multiple genes in many cell types. Many studies have investigated its signaling cascade, but other than the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway, these are still not clear. KLF10 plays a role in proliferation, differentiation as well as apoptosis, just like other members of the SP (specificity proteins)/KLF (Kruppel-like Factors). Recently, several studies reported that KLF10 KO (Knock out) is associated with defects in cell and organs such as osteopenia, abnormal tendon or cardiac hypertrophy. Since KLF10 was first discovered, several studies have defined its role in cancer as a tumor suppressor. KLF10 demonstrate anti-proliferative effects and induce apoptosis in various carcinoma cells including pancreatic cancer, leukemia, and osteoporosis. Collectively, these data indicate that KLF10 plays a significant role in various biological processes and diseases, but its role in cancer is still unclear. Therefore, this review was conducted to describe and discuss the role and function of KLF10 in diseases, including cancer, with a special emphasis on its signaling with TGF-beta.","['Memon, Azra', 'Lee, Woon Kyu']","['Memon A', 'Lee WK']","['Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 22212, Korea. azrabiochem@yahoo.com.', 'Laboratory of Developmental Genetics, Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 22212, Korea. wklee@inha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180525,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,['NOTNLM'],"['KLF10', 'TGF-beta', 'cancer', 'disease', 'tumor suppressor']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/05/26 06:01,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers10060161 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers10060161 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 May 25;10(6). pii: cancers10060161. doi: 10.3390/cancers10060161.,,,PMC6025274,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4971-6283'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While such findings have been interpreted as evidence that spending can be reduced without compromising patient outcomes, the link between spending variation and outcomes remains a critical question. OBJECTIVE: To use evidence from geographic variations in spending and an individual-level survival analysis to test whether spending within oncology care episodes is associated with survival, where episodes are defined as in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Oncology Care Model (OCM). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, patient data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare (SEER-Medicare) database for 2007-2013 were linked to hospital referral regions (HRRs) using ZIP codes. Patients in the SEER program are a part of selected population-based cancer registries throughout the United States whose records are linked to Medicare enrollment and claims data (93% of elderly registry patients were successfully linked to Medicare data). Episodes of cancer care were defined as in the OCM: 6 months following a triggering chemotherapy claim. We analyzed episodes of care for 5 tumor types: advanced breast cancer (BC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), multiple myeloma (MM), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We removed the effects of differentials in Medicare payment rates, which were mostly geographic. Regression analysis was then used to calculate standardized spending levels for each HRR, that is, spending adjusted for differences in patient and episode characteristics. To examine the effect of spending during OCM-defined episodes on individual-level survival, we used Cox regression with patient characteristics and standardized HRR spending per episode as covariates. To address concerns that may arise from multiple comparisons across the 5 tumor types, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate. RESULTS: Our analysis showed significant differences in standardized spending across HRRs. Compared with spending at the 20th percentile episode, spending at the 80th percentile ranged from 25% higher ($57,392 vs. $45,995 for MM) to 47% higher ($36,920 vs. $24,127 for RCC), indicating practice style variation across regions. The hazard of dying for patients with NSCLC and MM statistically significantly decreased by 7% (HR = 0.93, P = 0.006) and 13% (HR = 0.87, P = 0.019), respectively, for a $10,000 increase in standardized spending (in 2013 U.S. dollars). For the 3 other cancers, spending effects were not statistically significant. After using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a 5% false discovery rate, the effects of increased spending on improved survival for NSCLC and MM remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The association we found between spending and survival suggests caution may be warranted for physicians, pharmacists, other health care professionals, and policymakers involved in efforts to reduce across-the-board spending within OCM-defined episodes for at least 2 of the 5 cancers studied.

The corresponding odds ratio was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.59, 3.18). We also conducted logistic regression of abnormality rates on reciprocal distance for each NPS site. The trend was significant for NPS Beznau (regression coefficient beta = 1.5 +/- 0.3, P < 0.0001) but not significant for NPS Gosgen und NPS Leibstadt with little samples within 5 km. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to find adverse health effects on insects near operating nuclear power plants. Due to its ecological design, however, it cannot answer the question whether the effect is caused by radiation from nuclear power plants.","['Korblein, Alfred', 'Hesse-Honegger, Cornelia']","['Korblein A', 'Hesse-Honegger C']","['Untere Soldnersgasse 8, DE-90403, Nurnberg, Germany.', 'Feldeggstrasse 21, CH-8008, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180704,Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,IM,"['Animals', 'Heteroptera/*radiation effects', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Switzerland']",['NOTNLM'],"['NPS', 'abnormalities', 'insects', 'logistic regression', 'nuclear power station', 'radiation']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/09/13 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbdv.201800099 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2018 Aug;15(8):e1800099. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.201800099.

CLL has a wide range of clinical presentations and varied outcomes. For CLL, cytogenetic assessment is essential for estimating prognoses and determining the treatment of choice. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique is widely used for genetic assessment due to its high sensitivity. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the frequencies of deletions of 13q14.3, 17p13.1, 11q22.3, and 13q34 and of trisomy 12 and to observe their effects on survival in 226 Turkish CLL patients using FISH analysis. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The frequencies of abnormalities were 65.4% for del 13q14.3, 39.8% for del 17p13.1, 19% for del 11q22.3 (del ATM), and 15.9% for trisomy 12. No patients had a 13q34.3 aberration. Our results are partially consistent with literature findings. However, certain conflicts with prior results were observed, particularly with respect to the high prevalence of 17p13.1 deletions and the enhanced survival of patients with such deletions. These inconsistencies may represent population-based differences in the genetic epidemiology of CLL.","['Bagir, Emine Kilic', 'Acikalin, Arbil', 'Alsancak, Perihan', 'Paydas, Semra', 'Gurkan, Emel', 'Ergin, Melek']","['Bagir EK', 'Acikalin A', 'Alsancak P', 'Paydas S', 'Gurkan E', 'Ergin M']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Trisomy/*pathology', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell', 'chronic lymphocytic', 'cytogenetic', 'fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'leukemia']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2017_54_3_572_233141 [pii]', '10.4103/ijc.IJC_291_17 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2017 Jul-Sep;54(3):572-575. doi: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_291_17.,,,,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An aggressive proinflammatory immune response is generated in the gastric tissue infected with H. pylori, resulting in gastritis and a series of morphological changes that increase the susceptibility to cancer development. Probiotics could present an alternative solution to prevent or decrease H. pylori infection. Among them, the use of immunomodulatory lactic acid bacteria represents a promising option to reduce the severity of chronic inflammatory-mediated tissue damage and to improve protective immunity against H. pylori. We previously isolated Lactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C from human gastric tissue and demonstrated its capacity to reduce adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric epithelial cells (AGS cells). In this work, the ability of L. fermentum UCO-979C to modulate immune response in AGS cells and PMA phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 (human monocytic leukaemia) macrophages in response to H. pylori infection was evaluated. We demonstrated that the UCO-979C strain is able to differentially modulate the cytokine response of gastric epithelial cells and macrophages after H. pylori infection. Of note, L. fermentum UCO-979C was able to significantly reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in AGS and THP-1 cells as well as increase the levels of immunoregulatory cytokines, indicating a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect. These findings strongly support the probiotic potential of L. fermentum UCO-979C and provide evidence of its beneficial effects against the inflammatory damage induced by H. pylori infection. Although our findings should be proven in appropriate experiments in vivo, in both H. pylori infection animal models and human trials, the results of the present work provide a scientific rationale for the use of L. fermentum UCO-979C to prevent or reduce H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation in humans.","['Garcia-Castillo, V', 'Zelaya, H', 'Ilabaca, A', 'Espinoza-Monje, M', 'Komatsu, R', 'Albarracin, L', 'Kitazawa, H', 'Garcia-Cancino, A', 'Villena, J']","['Garcia-Castillo V', 'Zelaya H', 'Ilabaca A', 'Espinoza-Monje M', 'Komatsu R', 'Albarracin L', 'Kitazawa H', 'Garcia-Cancino A', 'Villena J']","['1 Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenicity, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Concepcion, Chacabuco s/n, Concepcion, Bio Bio 4030000, Chile.', '2 Laboratory of Immunobiotechnology, Reference Centre for Lactobacilli (CERELA-CONICET), Tucuman 4000, Argentina.', '3 Food and Feed Immunology Group, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 84-0051, Japan.', '2 Laboratory of Immunobiotechnology, Reference Centre for Lactobacilli (CERELA-CONICET), Tucuman 4000, Argentina.', '1 Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenicity, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Concepcion, Chacabuco s/n, Concepcion, Bio Bio 4030000, Chile.', '1 Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenicity, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Concepcion, Chacabuco s/n, Concepcion, Bio Bio 4030000, Chile.', '2 Laboratory of Immunobiotechnology, Reference Centre for Lactobacilli (CERELA-CONICET), Tucuman 4000, Argentina.', '2 Laboratory of Immunobiotechnology, Reference Centre for Lactobacilli (CERELA-CONICET), Tucuman 4000, Argentina.', '3 Food and Feed Immunology Group, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 84-0051, Japan.', '5 Laboratory of Computing Science, Faculty of Exact Sciences and Technology, Tucuman University, Av.

We assessed the impact of the 2016 WHO criteria on CMML diagnosis, compared with the 2008 WHO criteria, through a retrospective review of the medical records of 38 CMML patients diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO classification. Application of the 2016 WHO criteria resulted in the exclusion of three (8%) patients who did not fulfill the relative monocytosis criterion and eight (21%) patients with an MPN-associated mutation. These 11 patients formed the 2016 WHO others group; the remaining 27 formed the 2016 WHO CMML group. The significant difference in the platelet count and monocyte percentage between the two groups indicated that the 2016 WHO criteria lead to a more homogenous and improved definition of CMML compared with the 2008 WHO criteria, which may have led to over-diagnosis of CMML. More widespread use of molecular tests and more sophisticated clinical and morphological evaluations are necessary to diagnose CMML accurately.","['Moon, Yeonsook', 'Kim, Mi Hyang', 'Kim, Hye Ryoun', 'Ahn, Jeong Yeal', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Huh, Ji Young', 'Han, Jae Ho', 'Park, Joon Seong', 'Cho, Sung Ran']","['Moon Y', 'Kim MH', 'Kim HR', 'Ahn JY', 'Huh J', 'Huh JY', 'Han JH', 'Park JS', 'Cho SR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Inha University School of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Gachon University Gil Hospital, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea. sungran@aumc.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/classification/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trisomy', 'World Health Organization']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'Monocytosis', 'WHO classification']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/09/28 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['38.481 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2018.38.5.481 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2018 Sep;38(5):481-483. doi: 10.3343/alm.2018.38.5.481.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,PMC5973924,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8898-3301'],['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],,,['No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by a very high turnover rate, and are thus considered to be relatively free from the age-related insults generated by mitochondria. However, HSCs are also subject to these age-related insults, including the incidence of myeloid proliferative diseases, marrow failure, hematopoietic neoplasms, and deterioration of the adaptive human immune system. Recently, NAD(+) dietary supplements, known as niacin or vitamin B(3), including tryptophan, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and the newly identified NAD(+) precursor nicotinamide riboside, have been shown to play a role in restoring adult stem cell function through the amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction. This insight motivated a study that focused on reversing aging-related cellular dysfunction in adult mouse muscle stem cells by supplementing their diet with nicotinamide riboside. The remedial effect of nicotinamide riboside enhanced mitochondrial function in these muscle stem cells in a SIRT1-dependent manner, affecting cellular respiration, membrane potential, and production of ATP. Accordingly, numerous studies have demonstrated that sirtuins, under nuclear/mitochondrial control, have age-specific effects in determining HSC phenotypes. Based on the evidence accumulated thus far, we propose a clinical intervention for the restoration of aged HSC function by improving mitochondrial function through NAD(+) precursor supplementation.","['Moon, James', 'Kim, Hye Ran', 'Shin, Myung Geun']","['Moon J', 'Kim HR', 'Shin MG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, CA, USA.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, Korea. 98lani@gmail.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Korea. mgshin@jnu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/genetics/*metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Niacin/pharmacology', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology', 'Sirtuins/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aging', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'NAD(+) precursors', 'Restoration']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/09/28 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['38.395 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2018.38.5.395 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2018 Sep;38(5):395-401. doi: 10.3343/alm.2018.38.5.395.,"['0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '2679MF687A (Niacin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",,PMC5973912,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0658-3345', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0372-9185']",['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],,,['No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a pilot study cohort, peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 13 patients with myeloid neoplasms and one case of B lymphoblastic leukemia in complete hematologic remission after allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation were subjected to selection for leukemia-specific phenotypes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using individual marker combinations, followed by PCR-based chimerism analysis. RESULTS: The feasibility of this method could be demonstrated, with selection being successful in 12 cases, including two cases where mixed chimerism was found exclusively in sorted cells. Interestingly, four specimens displayed full donor chimerism in cells expressing the presumably aberrant combination CD34(+) /CD7(+) . Further analyses, including assessment of an independent cohort of 25 patients not affected by neoplastic bone marrow infiltration, revealed that normal myeloid precursors usually include a population coexpressing CD34, CD13, CD33, and CD7. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the combination CD34(+) /CD7(+) might not be suitable as an LAIP for MRD diagnostics and that a subset of normal myeloid precursors in the bone marrow expresses CD7.","['Kriegsmann, Katharina', 'Loffler, Harald', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Schulz, Renate', 'Kraker, Sandra', 'Braun, Ute', 'Luft, Thomas', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Schonland, Stefan', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Hundemer, Michael']","['Kriegsmann K', 'Loffler H', 'Eckstein V', 'Schulz R', 'Kraker S', 'Braun U', 'Luft T', 'Hegenbart U', 'Schonland S', 'Dreger P', 'Kramer A', 'Ho AD', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Hundemer M']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180704,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD7', 'chimerism', 'leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP)', 'minimal residual disease (MRD)', 'myeloid neoplasia']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13100 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2018 Sep;101(3):318-325. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13100.

Although comorbidities negatively affect outcomes for patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy, their impact on patients who receive targeted therapies is unknown. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective analysis evaluated the significance of comorbidities, as assessed by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), among patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five patients received ibrutinib (80% in a relapsed/refractory setting). A high burden of comorbidities (CIRS score >/= 7) was associated with inferior median event-free survival (EFS; 24 vs 37 months; P = .003) and 2-year overall survival (OS; 79% vs 100%; P = .005). In an adjusted Cox model, both EFS and OS worsened with an incremental increase in the CIRS score. Furthermore, comorbidities were associated with an increased risk of ibrutinib dose reduction and therapy discontinuation. CIRS was predictive in both frontline and relapsed CLL, regardless of patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities portend a poor prognosis among patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib.

Although individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have a substantially increased risk of leukemia, information on late effects in this group is almost nonexistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality and morbidity among 5-year leukemia survivors with DS. PROCEDURE: We compared 5-year leukemia survivors with leukemia-free individuals with DS. All individuals born with DS in Denmark between 1960 and 2007 and in Sweden between 1973 and 2009 were included. Long-term morbidity was estimated by comparing hospitalization rates between survivors and leukemia-free individuals. RESULTS: In total, we found 6,705 individuals with DS, 84 of whom were 5-year survivors of leukemia. Survivors had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-13) compared with leukemia-free individuals. All deaths (n = 7) among 5-year leukemia survivors were due to relapse. Survivors had a higher hospitalization rate (HR 4.4; 95% CI: 3.1-6.2). However, most of these hospitalizations were due to relapse. Censoring individuals who either had a relapse or were being treated for a relapse more than 5 years from the initial diagnosis (n = 9) attenuated the association (HR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-2.1). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that relapse was the main reason for death and hospitalization among leukemia survivors with DS, and not late effects. These results are reassuring for individuals treated for DS associated with leukemia and their parents.","['Vonasek, Julia', 'Asdahl, Peter', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Kallen, Karin', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Vonasek J', 'Asdahl P', 'Heyman M', 'Kallen K', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Center for Reproductive Epidemiology, Tornblad Institute, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Comorbidity', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/epidemiology/therapy', 'Morbidity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/mortality/therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', '*Survivors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Down syndrome', '*late effects', '*leukemia', '*morbidity', '*mortality']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27249 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Sep;65(9):e27249. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27249.

Because of major improvements in treatment protocols, the survival rate now exceeds 80%. However, ALL treatments can cause long-term neurocognitive sequelae, which negatively impact academic achievement and quality of life. Therefore, cognitive sequelae need to be carefully evaluated. The DIVERGT is a battery of tests proposed as a screening tool, sensitive to executive function impairments in children and adolescent cancer survivors. Our study aimed at verifying the predictive value of the DIVERGT on general cognitive functioning in adult long-term survivors of ALL. METHODS: ALL survivors completed the DIVERGT 13.4 years, on average, after remission (N = 247). In addition, 49 of these survivors (equally selected amongst those with low, average, and high DIVERGT scores) as well as 29 controls completed a more comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation within a 3-year period from DIVERGT administration. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the predictive value of the DIVERGT on general intelligence, mathematics, verbal memory, and working memory. As a follow-up analysis, three performance groups were created based on the DIVERGT results. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) assessed neuropsychological differences between groups. RESULTS: The DIVERGT accurately predicted General Ability Index (GAI) (P < 0.0001), mathematics (P < 0.0001) and verbal memory (P = 0.045). Moreover, the low-performance group consistently had poorer performance than the high-performance and control groups on the neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSION: The DIVERGT is a useful, time-effective screening battery for broader neurocognitive impairments identification in long-term adult ALL survivors. It could be implemented as routine examination in cancer follow-up clinics.","['Boulet-Craig, Aubree', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Laniel, Julie', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Sultan, Serge', 'Lippe, Sarah']","['Boulet-Craig A', 'Robaey P', 'Laniel J', 'Bertout L', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Sultan S', 'Lippe S']","['Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Psychology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'University of Ottawa, Department of Psychiatry, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Psychology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Psychology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Department of Psychology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/*methods', 'Mathematics', 'Memory Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cognitive dysfunction', '*follow-up studies', '*long-term survivors', '*screening']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27259 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Sep;65(9):e27259. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27259.

The change in the balance between these members governs the life and death of the cells. Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic member of this family and its distribution in normal and cancerous tissues strongly differs from that of Bcl-2. In human cancers, where upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins is common, Mcl-1 expression is regulated independent of Bcl-2 and its inhibition promotes senescence, a major barrier to tumorigenesis. Cancer chemotherapy determines various kinds of responses, such as senescence and autophagy; however, the ideal response to chemotherapy is apoptosis. Mcl-1 is a potent oncogene that is regulated at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels. Mcl-1 is a short-lived protein that, in the NH2 terminal region, contains sites for posttranslational regulation that can lead to proteasomal degradation. The USP9X Mcl-1 deubiquitinase regulates Mcl-1 and the levels of these two proteins are strongly correlated. Mcl-1 has three splicing variants (the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1L and the proapoptotic proteins Mcl-1S and Mcl-1ES), each contributing toward apoptosis regulation. In cancers responsible for the most deaths in the world, the presence of Mcl-1 is associated with malignant cell growth and evasion of apoptosis. Mcl-1 is also one of the key regulators of cancer stem cells' self-renewal that contributes to tumor survival. A great number of indirect and selective Mcl-1 inhibitors have been produced and some of these have shown efficacy in several clinical trials. Thus, therapeutic manipulation of Mcl-1 can be a useful strategy to combat cancer.","['De Blasio, Anna', 'Vento, Renza', 'Di Fiore, Riccardo']","['De Blasio A', 'Vento R', 'Di Fiore R']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Center for Biotechnology, Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Center for Biotechnology, Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180524,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-2 family', '*Mcl-1 in cancers', '*Mcl-1 isoforms', '*cancer care', '*cancer-stem-cells', '*targeting Mcl-1']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26786 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Nov;233(11):8482-8498. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26786.

Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is genetically distinct from cleft palate only (CPO). Numerous transcription factors (TFs) regulate normal development of the midface, comprising the premaxilla, maxilla and palatine bones, through control of basic cellular behaviors. Within the Pbx family of genes encoding Three Amino-acid Loop Extension (TALE) homeodomain-containing TFs, we previously established that in the mouse, Pbx1 plays a preeminent role in midfacial morphogenesis, and Pbx2 and Pbx3 execute collaborative functions in domains of coexpression. We also reported that Pbx1 loss from cephalic epithelial domains, on a Pbx2- or Pbx3-deficient background, results in CL/P via disruption of a regulatory network that controls apoptosis at the seam of frontonasal and maxillary process fusion. Conversely, Pbx1 loss in cranial neural crest cell (CNCC)-derived mesenchyme on a Pbx2-deficient background results in CPO, a phenotype not yet characterized. In this study, we provide in-depth analysis of PBX1 and PBX2 protein localization from early stages of midfacial morphogenesis throughout development of the secondary palate. We further establish CNCC-specific roles of PBX TFs and describe the developmental abnormalities resulting from their loss in the murine embryonic secondary palate. Additionally, we compare and contrast the phenotypes arising from PBX1 loss in CNCC with those caused by its loss in the epithelium and show that CNCC-specific Pbx1 deletion affects only later secondary palate morphogenesis. Moreover, CNCC mutants exhibit perturbed rostro-caudal organization and broadening of the midfacial complex. Proliferation defects are pronounced in CNCC mutants at gestational day (E)12.5, suggesting altered proliferation of mutant palatal progenitor cells, consistent with roles of PBX factors in maintaining progenitor cell state. Although the craniofacial skeletal abnormalities in CNCC mutants do not result from overt patterning defects, osteogenesis is delayed, underscoring a critical role of PBX factors in CNCC morphogenesis and differentiation. Overall, the characterization of tissue-specific Pbx loss-of-function mouse models with orofacial clefting establishes these strains as unique tools to further dissect the complexities of this congenital craniofacial malformation. This study closely links PBX TALE homeodomain proteins to the variation in maxillary shape and size that occurs in pathological settings and during evolution of midfacial morphology.","['Welsh, Ian C', 'Hart, James', 'Brown, Joel M', 'Hansen, Karissa', 'Rocha Marques, Marcelo', 'Aho, Robert J', 'Grishina, Irina', 'Hurtado, Romulo', 'Herzlinger, Doris', 'Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Garcia-Garcia, Maria J', 'Selleri, Licia']","['Welsh IC', 'Hart J', 'Brown JM', 'Hansen K', 'Rocha Marques M', 'Aho RJ', 'Grishina I', 'Hurtado R', 'Herzlinger D', 'Ferretti E', 'Garcia-Garcia MJ', 'Selleri L']","['Program in Craniofacial Biology, Departments of Orofacial Sciences and Anatomy, Institute of Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Departments of Orofacial Sciences and Anatomy, Institute of Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Departments of Orofacial Sciences and Anatomy, Institute of Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Departments of Orofacial Sciences and Anatomy, Institute of Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Program in Craniofacial Biology, Departments of Orofacial Sciences and Anatomy, Institute of Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180523,England,J Anat,Journal of anatomy,0137162,IM,"['Animals', 'Cleft Palate/genetics', 'Cranial Nerves/*embryology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Palate/*embryology/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Pbx', '*birth defect', '*cleft lip/palate (CL/P)', '*cleft palate only (CPO)', '*craniofacial', '*morphogenesis', '*skeleton', '*tissue-specific', '*transcription factor']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/joa.12821 [doi]'],ppublish,J Anat. 2018 Aug;233(2):222-242. doi: 10.1111/joa.12821.

The activation of STAT3(pY705) occurs mainly through Janus kinases. However, it remains unclear how STAT3(pY705) levels are decreased in mESCs. Our study shows that upregulation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN2) inhibits STAT3 activity by reducing its phosphorylation level and promotes mESC differentiation, whereas PTPN2 knockout by CRISPR/CAS9 delays mESC differentiation. Consistently, PTPN2 knockdown facilitates the generation of mESC-like colonies in STAT3-overexpressing EpiSCs. PTPN2-mediated STAT3 activity, thus, contributes to the exit of ESCs from the pluripotent ground state.

We screened for misregulated DNA repair genes by enhanced RNA-sequencing on bone marrow from a discovery cohort of 27 CMML patients and 9 controls. We validated 4 differentially expressed candidates in CMML CD34(+) bone marrow selected cells and in an independent cohort of 74 CMML patients, mutationally contextualized by targeted sequencing, and assessed their transcriptional behavior in 70 myelodysplastic syndrome, 66 acute myeloid leukaemia and 25 chronic myeloid leukaemia cases. We found BAP1 and PARP1 down-regulation to be specific to CMML compared with other related disorders. Chromatin-regulator mutated cases showed decreased BAP1 dosage. We validated a significant over-expression of the double strand break-fidelity genes CDKN1A and ERCC1, independent of promoter methylation and associated with chemorefractoriness. In addition, patients bearing mutations in the splicing component SRSF2 displayed numerous aberrant splicing events in DNA repair genes, with a quantitative predominance in the single strand break pathway. Our results highlight potential targets in this disease, which currently has few therapeutic options.","['Hurtado, Ana M', 'Luengo-Gil, Gines', 'Chen-Liang, Tzu H', 'Amaral, Fabio', 'Batta, Kiran', 'Palomo, Laura', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Caparros, Eva', 'Amigo, Maria L', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria', 'Zamora, Lurdes', 'Salido Fierrez, Eduardo J', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Ortuno, Francisco J', 'Vicente, Vicente', 'Del Canizo, Maria', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Ferrer-Marin, Francisca', 'Wiseman, Daniel H', 'Jerez, Andres']","['Hurtado AM', 'Luengo-Gil G', 'Chen-Liang TH', 'Amaral F', 'Batta K', 'Palomo L', 'Lumbreras E', 'Przychodzen B', 'Caparros E', 'Amigo ML', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Zamora L', 'Salido Fierrez EJ', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Ortuno FJ', 'Vicente V', 'Del Canizo M', 'Sole F', 'Ferrer-Marin F', 'Wiseman DH', 'Jerez A']","['Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK, Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia- Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia- Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia- Research Institute, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB-CIBERERUCAM, Murcia, Spain.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Haematology Department, Hospital Morales Meseguer, IMIB, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CMML transcriptome', '*cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A)', '*excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1)', '*poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1)', '*synthetic lethality']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/06/08 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15408 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Aug;182(3):373-383. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15408.

BLV infects a wide range of animals as well as cell lines derived from various mammalian species and organs; however, studies show that only some cell lines support sustained production of viral progeny. The differences between cells that produce viral progeny and those that do not are unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the steps of BLV replication that are associated with the capacity of a cell to support a productive infection. Eleven cell lines derived from various species were categorized into two groups, those that produce BLV progeny and those that do not, and the efficiency of viral attachment was compared. In addition, viral entry and reverse transcription were compared for two BLV-producing cell lines and three non-producing cell lines. BLV attached to and entered all of the tested cells. However, synthesis of viral DNA was inhibited in all three non-virus-producing cell lines, suggesting that BLV production was blocked either prior to or at the stage of reverse transcription. These results increase our understanding of the BLV life cycle and should enable better control over the spread of BLV.","['Suzuki, Takako', 'Ikeda, Hidetoshi', 'Mase, Masaji']","['Suzuki T', 'Ikeda H', 'Mase M']","['National Institute of Animal Health, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan. takako@affrc.go.jp.', 'National Institute of Animal Health, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.', 'National Institute of Animal Health, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180523,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chiroptera', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Disease Resistance/*genetics', 'Dogs', 'Epithelial Cells/classification/immunology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Species Specificity', 'Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-018-3887-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-018-3887-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2018 Sep;163(9):2415-2422. doi: 10.1007/s00705-018-3887-6.

Management of cytopenias in myelofibrosis can be very challenging because current therapeutic interventions are only of modest efficacy and ruxolitinib, the only approved drug for myelofibrosis, is myelosuppressive. Yet, dose optimization of ruxolitinib is important for its survival benefit in patients with advanced disease. We sought to summarize the data on treatments for cytopenias available at present and review promising agents in development and emerging strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: The activin receptor ligand traps hold considerable promise for the treatment of anemia and could represent an attractive combination strategy with ruxolitinib. Low-dose thalidomide, which could offset both anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by ruxolitinib, represents another potential partner for ruxolitinib. The anti-fibrotic agent PRM-151 produced sustained improvements in cytopenias in some patients, and further data on this drug are eagerly awaited. Finally, several preclinical leads with translational potential are worthy of clinical investigation as strategies to halt/reverse bone marrow fibrosis and thereby improve cytopenias. Cytopenias remain a significant hurdle in myelofibrosis management, but several novel investigational agents hold considerable promise for the future.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Blvd, FC4.3062, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. pbose@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Blvd, FC4.3062, Unit 428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['*Anemia/blood/drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Nitriles', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Survival Rate', '*Thrombocytopenia/blood/drug therapy/etiology/mortality']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Alisertib', '*Anemia', '*LCL-161', '*Luspatercept', '*Momelotinib', '*Myelofibrosis', '*PRM-151', '*Ruxolitinib', '*Sotatercept', '*Thalidomide', '*Thrombocytopenia']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/12/21 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0447-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0447-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Jun;13(3):164-172. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0447-9.,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a 67-year-old Hispanic female who presented with complaints of decreased oral intake and fatigue since three months. Hyponatremia on initial presentation was attributed to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion and managed with fluid restriction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed multiple pulmonary nodules suggestive of miliary tuberculosis, however, sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears were negative. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and specimens sent for AFB testing. A concurrent endoscopy with biopsy was done to evaluate dysphagia. Both respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) specimens were positive for Strongyloides stercoralis. Treatment with ivermectin and prophylactic antibiotics was started. The patient developed septic shock and had multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite aggressive management, she expired. Subsequently, cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were positive and the autopsy demonstrated evidence of MTB infection in the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. This case illustrates the importance of considering co-infection with Strongyloides stercoralis in patients with MTB, both associated with depressed cellular immunity.","['Saradna, Arjun', 'Shenoy, Amith', 'Ambesh, Paurush', 'Kamholz, Stephan']","['Saradna A', 'Shenoy A', 'Ambesh P', 'Kamholz S']","['Internal Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center.', 'Pulmonary Critical Care, Winthrop University Hospital.', 'Internal Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center.', 'Chair, Department of Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180320,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hyperinfection', 'miliary', 'siadh', 'stercoralis', 'strongyloides', 'tuberculosis']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/05/26 06:01,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.2349 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2018 Mar 20;10(3):e2349. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2349.,,,PMC5959311,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DOT1L, the sole methyltransferase for three states of H3K79me, is implicated in leukemia, co-lorectal cancer, and dilated cardiomyopathy. However, understanding of DOT1L and H3K79me in these pathways and disease pathogenesis has been limited due to the difficulty of working with DOT1L protein. For instance, locus-specific or genome-wide binding sites of DOT1L revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based methods are necessary for inferring its functions, but high-quality ChIP-grade antibodies are currently not available. Herein we have developed a knock-in approach to tag endogenous DOT1L with 3 x Flag at its C-terminal domain to follow functional analyses. The knock-in was facilitated by using TALENs to induce a targeted double-strand break at the endogenous DOTIL to stimulate local homologous recombination at that site. The single cell colonies with successful knock-in were isolated and verified by different methods. We also demonstrated that tagged DOT1L maintains its normal function in terms of methylation and that the engineered cells would be very useful for further studies.","['An, Cheng', 'Zhu, Guangjing', 'Martos, Suzanne N', 'Feng, Xue', 'Zhang, Haimou', 'Jia, Yankai', 'Wang, Zhibin']","['An C', 'Zhu G', 'Martos SN', 'Feng X', 'Zhang H', 'Jia Y', 'Wang Z']","[""Guang'an Men Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."", 'Laboratory of Human Environmental Epigenomes, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Human Environmental Epigenomes, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Human Environmental Epigenomes, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', ""Guang'an Men Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."", 'School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, China.', 'GENEWIZ Suzhou, Suzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Human Environmental Epigenomes, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, China.', 'Fenxian Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology and Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170922,United States,Adv Biosci Biotechnol,Advances in bioscience and biotechnology (Print),101553812,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DOT1L', 'Flag', 'Knock-In', 'TALEN']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/05/26 06:01,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4236/abb.2017.89023 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Biosci Biotechnol. 2017 Sep;8(9):311-323. doi: 10.4236/abb.2017.89023.

Nowadays, more than 2500 miRNAs have been described, that regulate more than 50% of genes, including those involved in B-cell maturation, differentiation and proliferation. Genetic variants in miRNAs can alter their own levels or function, affecting their target gene expression, and then, may affect ALL risk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of miRNA genetic variants in B-ALL susceptibility. We analyzed all variants in pre-miRNAs (MAF > 1%) in two independent cohorts from Spain and Slovenia and inferred their functional effect by in silico analysis. SNPs rs12402181 in miR-3117 and rs62571442 in miR-3689d2 were associated with ALL risk in both cohorts, possibly through their effect on MAPK signalling pathway.

CRLF2 protein overexpression leads to activated JAK/STAT signaling and trials are underway using JAK inhibitors to overcome treatment failure. Pre-clinical studies indicated limited efficacy of single JAK inhibitors, thus additional pathways must be targeted in hiCRLF2 cells. To identify additional activated networks, we used single-cell mass cytometry to examine 15 BCP-ALL primary patient samples. We uncovered a coordinated signaling network downstream of CRLF2 characterized by co-activation of JAK/STAT, PI3K, and CREB pathways. This CRLF2-driven network could be more effectively disrupted by SRC/ABL inhibition than single-agent JAK or PI3K inhibition, and this could be demonstrated even in primary minimal residual disease (MRD) cells. Our study suggests SCR/ABL inhibition as effective in disrupting the cooperative functional networks present in hiCRLF2 BCP-ALL patients, supporting further investigation of this strategy in pre-clinical studies.","['Sarno, Jolanda', 'Savino, Angela M', 'Buracchi, Chiara', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Pinto, Stefania', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Jager, Astraea', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Barber, Ruth C', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Israeli, Shai', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Davis, Kara L', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe']","['Sarno J', 'Savino AM', 'Buracchi C', 'Palmi C', 'Pinto S', 'Bugarin C', 'Jager A', 'Bresolin S', 'Barber RC', 'Silvestri D', 'Israeli S', 'Dyer MJS', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Nolan GP', 'Biondi A', 'Davis KL', 'Gaipa G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'M.

Sequestration of free IgE using humanized IgG anti-IgE is an effective therapy for asthma and other atopic disorders. However, the status of free IgE in subjects who have naturally developed immune tolerance to inhaled antigens has not been well studied. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) for 7 days to induce allergic airway disease (AAD) or 6 weeks to induce a state of local inhalational tolerance (LIT). Serum from AAD or LIT mice, diluted to achieve equivalent levels of total OVA-specific IgE, was used to sensitize rat basophil leukemia cells for allergen-mediated degranulation. Levels of degranulation were measured in relation to serum concentrations of free IgE and IgG anti-IgE/IgE immune complexes. Results: Serum from AAD animals induced a greater degree of basophil degranulation than serum from LIT animals. These results correlated with higher levels of free IgE in AAD animals, whereas LIT mice demonstrated a significant increase in IgG anti-IgE/IgE immune complexes relative to their diseased counterparts. Conclusions: Sequestration of free IgE by naturally occurring IgG anti-IgE may aid in the development of immune tolerance against inhaled allergens. The decrease in bioavailability of free IgE may, in turn, contribute to the overall reduction of asthma symptoms via a mechanism that mimics the therapeutic effects of humanized IgG anti-IgE.","['Bracken, Sonali J', 'Adami, Alexander J', 'Rafti, Ektor', 'Schramm, Craig M', 'Matson, Adam P']","['Bracken SJ', 'Adami AJ', 'Rafti E', 'Schramm CM', 'Matson AP']","['1Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut Health, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.0000000419370394grid.208078.5', '1Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut Health, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.0000000419370394grid.208078.5', ""2Department of Pediatrics, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, CT USA.0000 0001 0440 7332grid.414666.7"", ""2Department of Pediatrics, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, CT USA.0000 0001 0440 7332grid.414666.7"", '1Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut Health, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.0000000419370394grid.208078.5', ""2Department of Pediatrics, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, CT USA.0000 0001 0440 7332grid.414666.7""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180518,England,Clin Mol Allergy,Clinical and molecular allergy : CMA,101152195,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-IgE', 'Asthma', 'Autoantibodies', 'Hexosaminidase', 'IgE', 'Omalizumab', 'Ovalbumin', 'Tolerance']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/05/26 06:01,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12948-018-0091-x [doi]', '91 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Mol Allergy. 2018 May 18;16:13. doi: 10.1186/s12948-018-0091-x. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5960149,,,['F30 HL126324/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL progresses slowly over years, but it eventually transforms to a more aggressive lymphoma such as the diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) type, also known as Richter's syndrome. Case presentation: We treated a 69-year-old Japanese male who was histologically diagnosed with Richter's syndrome after 6 years of CLL. His lymphadenopathy had systemically progressed for years, with lymphocyte counts of less than 10,000 cells/muL and a disease status of Rai classification stage I and Binet classification B. He had high fever and hepatosplenomegaly upon Richter's transformation. The patient was treated with ofatumumab for refractory CLL, which relieved his febrile lymphadenopathy. He received a total of 11 ofatumumab courses and achieved partial remission. On the day of the 12th course of ofatumumab, his disease relapsed with febrile lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography revealed multiple liver masses and systemic lymphadenopathy, while a liver biopsy confirmed T-cell lymphoma. Concomitantly, CD20-lacking CLL cells were detected in his peripheral blood and bone marrow, and pathological examination of his left cervical lymph node biopsy showed CD20-positive DLBCL. The final diagnosis was three different types of lymphoma pathologies: (1) CD20-positive DLBCL of the lymph nodes, (2) CD20-lacking CLL of the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and (3) peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) of the liver. He received intravenous and oral dexamethasone therapy as palliative care. He died because of the rapid progression of abdominal masses 2 months after the diagnosis of triple transformation CLL. An autopsy revealed aggressive PTCL with aggressive systemic involvement of the liver, spleen, gall bladder, pericardium, bone marrow, and mediastinal-paraaortic-intraceliac lymph nodes. T-cell receptor study of an autopsy specimen supported the diagnosis of PTCL that spread to the intraceliac organs and lymph nodes. We concluded that his pathogenicity progressed to a mixture of triple lymphoma as a result of double malignant transformations, which included PTCL from CLL, CD20-negative CLL, and CD20-positive DLBCL by Richter's transformation. Conclusions: Our case provides information on the biology of CLL, to transform from a low-grade chemosensitive status to a malignant chemoresistant status.","['Imataki, Osamu', 'Uemura, Makiko']","['Imataki O', 'Uemura M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-town, Kita-county, Kagawa, 761-0793 Japan.0000 0000 8662 309Xgrid.258331.e', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-town, Kita-county, Kagawa, 761-0793 Japan.0000 0000 8662 309Xgrid.258331.e']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180522,England,BMC Clin Pathol,BMC clinical pathology,101088665,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'Ofatumumab', ""Richter's syndrome"", 'Transformation']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/05/26 06:01,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12907-018-0072-5 [doi]', '72 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Clin Pathol. 2018 May 22;18:5. doi: 10.1186/s12907-018-0072-5. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5964677,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5332-1316'],,,,"['The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kagawa', 'University Hospital (approval number H23-23).Written informed consent was', 'obtained from the patient for publication of this Case Report and all', 'accompanying images.

We searched four electronic databases from inception through July 2017 without any language restrictions and included studies on different types of hematological malignancies reporting both BMI time points and HSCT. Of the 1420 articles identified, 26 articles were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Three weight groups (obese, overweight and underweight) were individually compared with the normal group. Summary risk estimates for OS and event-free survival (EFS) were calculated with random- or fixed-effects models. For BMI at the pre-HSCT stage, a statistically significant positive association of increased risk of OS (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08-1.27) and EFS (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1-1.67) was identified in underweight individuals compared with those with normal weights. For BMI in the HSCT stage, a lower BMI was significantly associated with poorer OS (RR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.01-1.78) and EFS (RR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.09-2.06) compared with a normal BMI.

However, information on the effect of GVHD in pediatric leukemia is limited. Using a nationwide registry, we retrospectively analyzed 1526 children who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for leukemia. Grades 0-I acute GVHD were associated with a higher relapse rate at three years after transplantation, at 25.4 and 24.3%, respectively, than grades II, III, or IV acute GVHD at 18.9%, 21.2%, and 2.6%, respectively. In contrast, the overall survival curve of the grades 0 and I GVHD groups (79.0% and 79.5%, respectively) approximated that of the grade II GVHD group (76.3%), and the probability of survival was worst in the severe GVHD groups (66.9% for grade III and 42.5% for grade IV). Chronic GVHD also reduced the relapse risk but conferred no survival advantage. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was more sensitive to acute GVHD than acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while AML was more sensitive to chronic GVHD.

Here, we present long-term follow-up results on 25 pediatric patients, (acute leukemia n = 15, NHL n = 3, CML n = 3, MDS n = 5), transplanted with CD34 or CD133 positively selected PBSC from MUDs supplemented with an add-back of 1 x 10(7)/kg body weight (kgBW) unselected T cells resulting in a median T-cell depletion (TCD) of 1.97 log. A total of 24/25 (96%) patients had primary engraftment. Early T-cell recovery was significantly improved compared to patients receiving CD34-selected grafts without T-cell add-back and similar to patients receiving unmanipulated bone marrow. GvHD incidence was low with 8/4% aGvHD grade II/III, no grade IV and 13% limited cGvHD. In total, 16/25 (64%) patients are alive after a median follow-up of 10 years.

We used the US population-based cancer registry data to evaluate risk of myeloid neoplasms among three cohorts of cancer survivors initially treated with radiotherapy only. We included 1-year survivors of first primary thyroid (radioiodine only, stages I-IV; N = 49 879), prostate (excluding stage IV; N = 237 439), or uterine corpus cancers (stage I-II; N = 16 208) diagnosed during 2000-2013. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs). Thyroid cancer survivors had significantly elevated risks of total AML (SIR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.99-3.76), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.57-8.04), AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (SIR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.05-6.25), and BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (SIR = 5.38, 95% CI: 2.58-9.89). Irradiated prostate and uterine corpus cancer survivors were at elevated risk for total AML (SIR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.27 and SIR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-2.87, respectively), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.84-3.37 and SIR = 7.21, 95% CI: 2.34-16.83, respectively), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (SIR = 3.20, 95% CI: 2.20-4.49 and SIR = 8.88, 95% CI: 2.42-22.73, respectively). In addition, prostate cancer survivors were at increased risk of BCR-ABL1-positive CML (SIR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.52-2.85). Our findings support the importance of diagnostic precision in myeloid neoplasm classification since susceptibility following radiotherapy may vary by myeloid neoplasm subtype, thereby informing risk/benefit discussions in first primary cancer treatment.","['Teepen, Jop C', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Dores, Graca M', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Kremer, Leontien C M', 'Gilbert, Ethel S', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'Morton, Lindsay M']","['Teepen JC', 'Curtis RE', 'Dores GM', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Kremer LCM', 'Gilbert ES', 'van Leeuwen FE', 'Ronckers CM', 'Morton LM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.c.teepen@amc.uva.nl."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands. j.c.teepen@amc.uva.nl.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'United States']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0149-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0149-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Dec;32(12):2580-2589. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0149-2.

Hierarchical analysis revealed that of TET2(MT) cases >40% were ancestral, e.g., representing 8% of MDS. Higher (earlier) TET2 lesion rank within the clonal hierarchy (greater clonal burden) was associated with impaired survival. Moreover, MDS driven by ancestral TET2(MT) is likely derived from TET2(MT) CHIP with a penetrance of ~1%. Following ancestral TET2 mutations, individual disease course is determined by secondary hits. Using multidimensional analyses, we demonstrate how hits following the TET2 founder defect induces phenotypic shifts toward dysplasia, myeloproliferation, or progression to AML. In summary, TET2(MT) CHIP-derived MDS is a subclass of MDS that is distinct from de novo disease.","['Hirsch, Cassandra M', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Kneen, Kassy', 'Abazeed, Mohamed E', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej P', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Adema, Vera', 'Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Goyal, Abhinav', 'Awada, Hassan', 'Asad, Mohammad Fahad', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Guan, Yihong', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Olinski, Ryszard', 'Jha, Babal Kant', 'LaFramboise, Thomas', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Hirsch CM', 'Nazha A', 'Kneen K', 'Abazeed ME', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Przychodzen BP', 'Nadarajah N', 'Adema V', 'Nagata Y', 'Goyal A', 'Awada H', 'Asad MF', 'Visconte V', 'Guan Y', 'Sekeres MA', 'Olinski R', 'Jha BK', 'LaFramboise T', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Haferlach T', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratories, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratories, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratories, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. maciejj@ccf.org.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. maciejj@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0150-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0150-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Aug;32(8):1751-1761. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0150-9.

It is generally categorized by clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells and differentiation. The molecular mechanism behind the myeloid malignancies is not yet known, but recent sequencing analysis reveals all the mutated factors. As we know that there is currently no compromise on therapy for such types of malignancies and at the present painful process like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are not effective for the treatment of ML, so there is an urgent need to develop a non-invasive biomarker for different types of ML. MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) is a small non-coding RNAs that have been involved in a wide range of biological function and it is the main cause of the manifestation of many diseases. Among the reported MiRNAs, MIR-21 is considered to be an important MiRNA, which is frequently elevated in many types of types of cancer, suggesting that it plays an important role in cancer progressions. So far, there is no paper that signifies the role of miR-21 in all types of ML and the number of studies on the different category of ML is sparse. Therefore, the main thrust of this paper is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence and significance of miR-21 in ML. It was found that MiR-21 was found to be normally upregulated in all types of ML, however, we summarize the important research findings surrounding the role of miR-21 in different types of ML.","['Panagal, Mani', 'S R, Senthil Kumar', 'P, Sivakurunathan', 'M, Biruntha', 'M, Karthigeyan', 'Gopinathe, Vincent', 'Sivakumare, Pethanen', 'Sekar, Durairaj']","['Panagal M', 'S R SK', 'P S', 'M B', 'M K', 'Gopinathe V', 'Sivakumare P', 'Sekar D']","['Department of Biotechnology, Annai College of Arts and Science, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, 612001, India.', ""School of Biological Science, St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, 620002, India."", 'School of Bioscience, Department of Microbiology, Annamalai University, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, 608002, India.', 'Department of Animal Health and Management, Alagappa University, Karaikkudi, Tamil Nadu, 630003, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Arumugam Pillai Seethai Ammal College, Tiruppattur, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Arumugam Pillai Seethai Ammal College, Tiruppattur, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Arumugam Pillai Seethai Ammal College, Tiruppattur, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Life Science, Kristu Jayanti College (Autonomous), Bangalore University, Bengaluru, 560064, India. duraimku@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180525,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-018-0025-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-018-0025-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2018 Aug;25(7-8):161-166. doi: 10.1038/s41417-018-0025-2.

Because outcomes for patients with MDS are heterogeneous, individual risk stratification using tools such as the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) is important in managing patients-including selecting candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the only potentially curative therapy for MDS. The IPSS-R can be supplemented by molecular genetic testing, since certain gene mutations such as TP53 influence risk independent of established clinicopathological variables. For lower risk patients with symptomatic anemia, treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or lenalidomide (especially for those with deletion of chromosome 5q) can ameliorate symptoms. Some lower risk patients may be candidates for immunosuppressive therapy, thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents, or a DNA hypomethylating agent (HMA; azacitidine or decitabine). Among higher risk patients, transplant candidates should undergo ASCT as soon as possible, with HMAs useful as a bridge to transplant. Non-transplant candidates should initiate HMA therapy and continue if tolerated until disease progression. Supportive care with transfusions and antimicrobial drugs as needed remains important in all groups.","['Steensma, David P']",['Steensma DP'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

We report exome sequencing of 64 matched samples collected from patients at initial diagnosis, during remission, and following relapse after historical combined RA-chemotherapy treatments. A first subgroup presents a high incidence of additional oncogenic mutations disrupting key epigenetic or transcriptional regulators (primarily WT1) or activating MAPK signaling at diagnosis. Relapses retain these cooperating oncogenes and exhibit additional oncogenic alterations and/or mutations impeding therapy response (RARA, NT5C2). The second group primarily exhibits FLT3 activation at diagnosis, which is lost upon relapse together with most other passenger mutations, implying that these relapses derive from ancestral pre-leukemic PML/RARA-expressing cells that survived RA/chemotherapy. Accordingly, clonogenic activity of PML/RARA-immortalized progenitors ex vivo is only transiently affected by RA, but selectively abrogated by arsenic. Our studies stress the role of cooperating oncogenes in direct relapses and suggest that targeting pre-leukemic cells by arsenic contributes to its clinical efficacy.","['Lehmann-Che, Jacqueline',

We examined 118 BPDCN cases for cytomorphology, MYC locus rearrangement, and MYC expression. Sixty-two (53%) and 41 (35%) cases showed the classic and immunoblastoid cytomorphology, respectively. Forty-one (38%) MYC(+)BPDCN (positive for rearrangement and expression) and 59 (54%) MYC(-)BPDCN (both negative) cases were identified. Immunoblastoid cytomorphology was significantly associated with MYC(+)BPDCN. All examined MYC(+)BPDCNs were negative for MYB/MYBL1 rearrangement (0/36). Clinically, MYC(+)BPDCN showed older onset, poorer outcome, and localized skin tumors more commonly than MYC(-)BPDCN. MYC was demonstrated by expression profiling as one of the clearest discriminators between CAL-1 (MYC(+)BPDCN) and PMDC05 (MYC(-)BPDCN) cell lines, and its shRNA knockdown suppressed CAL-1 viability. Inhibitors for bromodomain and extra-terminal protein (BETis), and aurora kinases (AKis) inhibited CAL-1 growth more effectively than PMDC05. We further showed that a BCL2 inhibitor was effective in both CAL-1 and PMDC05, indicating that this inhibitor can be used to treat MYC(-)BPDCN, to which BETis and AKis are probably less effective.

Gene modules were simulated using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and the top soft-connected genes (hub genes) were filtrated with a threshold (0.5).

It ranges from skin lesions as cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) which may spontaneously regress to highly aggressive neoplasms with multiorgan involvement corresponding to some aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), mast cell leukemia (MCL), and/or mast cell sarcoma (MCS).There is increasing evidence of CD30 expression in neoplastic MCs of the bone marrow. This expression has been described almost exclusively in aggressive forms of systemic mastocytosis (SM).The aim of the present study is to evaluate CD30 expression both in cutaneous and systemic forms of mastocytosis. Forty-two mastocytosis cases were reviewed, including cutaneous (n = 29) and systemic (n = 13) forms to assess the prevalence of CD30 expression. Thirty-nine out of 42 (92.8%) cases were CD30 positive. In cases of CM, 28/29 (96.5%) cases were CD30 positive, 11/13 cases of SM (84.6%) were positive for CD30. MCs in normal skin biopsies and in urticaria lesions were CD30-negative. This study found that CD30 is also frequently expressed in CM as well as in systemic forms.

This improvement in survival has been attributed to both treatment intensification and improved supportive care over the decades, although the precise impact of each remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a unique cohort of 276 patients with de novo AML diagnosed in childhood, all treated with the same chemotherapy protocol over a 25-year period from 1986 to 2012. RESULTS: The contemporary cohort (2000-2012), compared with the historical cohort (1986-1999) had significantly improved overall survival (75% vs. 50%; hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.93), lower disease-related mortality (38% vs. 19%, P=0.02) and were significantly more likely to receive an allogeneic transplant after relapse (stem cell transplantation [SCT], 73% vs. 12%; P<0.0001). Allogeneic transplant postrelapse was associated with a significantly improved survival across the entire cohort (overall survival 50% for allogeneic SCT vs. 12% for autologous or none, P<0.0001). There was no significant difference between the contemporary and historical cohorts in treatment-related mortality (13% vs. 7%, P=0.42) or relapse rates after induction (50% in older cohort vs. 40% in recent era, P=0.25), suggesting consistency of induction treatment efficacy and toxicity across the 2 periods. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests improved survival in pediatric AML in the modern era has predominantly resulted from changes in treatment after relapse, including increased use of allogeneic SCT.","['Vedi, Aditi', 'Mitchell, Richard', 'Shanmuganathan, Sunita', 'Oswald, Cecilia', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Trahair, Toby', 'Sivarajasingam, Siva', 'Ziegler, David S']","['Vedi A', 'Mitchell R', 'Shanmuganathan S', 'Oswald C', 'Marshall GM', 'Trahair T', 'Sivarajasingam S', 'Ziegler DS']","[""Sydney Children's Hospital, University of New South Wales."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital, University of New South Wales."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital, University of New South Wales.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*trends', 'Historically Controlled Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Pediatrics', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Therapeutics/trends', 'Time', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001215 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Oct;40(7):541-547. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To detect them, most diagnostic laboratories use karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and reverse transcription PCR. Targeted locus amplification (TLA), a technique using next-generation sequencing, now allows detection of the translocation partner of a specific gene, regardless of its chromosomal origin. We present a TLA multiplex assay as a potential first-tier screening test for detecting translocations in leukemia diagnostics. METHODS: The panel includes 17 genes involved in many translocations present in acute leukemias. Procedures were optimized by using a training set of cell line dilutions and 17 leukemia patient bone marrow samples and validated by using a test set of cell line dilutions and a further 19 patient bone marrow samples. Per gene, we determined if its region was involved in a translocation and, if so, the translocation partner. To balance sensitivity and specificity, we introduced a gray zone showing indeterminate translocation calls needing confirmation. We benchmarked our method against results from the 3 standard diagnostic tests. RESULTS: In patient samples passing QC, we achieved a concordance with benchmarking tests of 81% in the training set and 100% in the test set, after confirmation of 4 and nullification of 3 gray zone calls (in total). In cell line dilutions, we detected translocations in 10% aberrant cells at several genetic loci. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex TLA shows promising results as an acute leukemia screening test. It can detect cryptic and other translocations in selected genes. Further optimization may make this assay suitable for diagnostic use.","['Alimohamed, Mohamed Z', 'Johansson, Lennart F', 'de Boer, Eddy N', 'Splinter, Erik', 'Klous, Petra', 'Yilmaz, Mehmet', 'Bosga, Anneke', 'van Min, Max', 'Mulder, Andre B', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Sinke, Richard J', 'Sijmons, Rolf H', 'van den Berg, Eva', 'Sikkema-Raddatz, Birgit']","['Alimohamed MZ', 'Johansson LF', 'de Boer EN', 'Splinter E', 'Klous P', 'Yilmaz M', 'Bosga A', 'van Min M', 'Mulder AB', 'Vellenga E', 'Sinke RJ', 'Sijmons RH', 'van den Berg E', 'Sikkema-Raddatz B']","['University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands; l.johansson@umcg.nl.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Genomics Coordination Center, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Cergentis b.v., Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Cergentis b.v., Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Cergentis b.v., Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Cergentis b.v., Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Laboratory Medicine, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Hematology, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Proof of Concept Study', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2017.286047 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2017.286047 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2018 Jul;64(7):1096-1103. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2017.286047.

Data from 2143 donor-recipient pairs (n = 218 haploidentical sibling; n = 218 offspring; n = 1707 HLA-matched sibling) with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia were studied. All received a calcineurin inhibitor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis while high-dose PT-Cy was also given to recipients of haploidentical transplant. Patient age correlated with donor-recipient relationship: haploidentical siblings donated to patients aged 18 to 54 years whereas offspring donated to patients aged 55 to 76 years. Therefore, transplant outcomes were examined separately in the 2 patient age groups. In patients aged 18 to 54 years, there were no significant differences in outcomes except chronic GVHD, which was lower after haploidentical sibling compared to HLA-matched sibling transplant (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; P < .001). In patients aged 55 to 76 years, despite lower chronic GVHD (HR, 0.42; P < .001), graft failure (14% vs 6%; P = .003), nonrelapse mortality (HR, 1.48; P = .02), and overall mortality (HR, 1.32; P = .003) were higher after transplant from offspring compared with an HLA-matched sibling. These data demonstrate a superior outcome in older recipients when using an HLA-matched sibling instead of offspring, although there were differences in transplant platforms (GVHD prophylaxis and graft type) between the 2 groups.

However, causality is not the only possible explanation for the epidemiological associations, as animal and in vitro experiments have provided only limited support for carcinogenic effects of ELF magnetic fields. Importantly, there is no generally accepted biophysical mechanism that could explain such effects. In this review, we discuss the possibility that carcinogenic effects are based on the radical pair mechanism (RPM), which seems to be involved in magnetoreception in birds and certain other animals, allowing navigation in the geomagnetic field. We review the current understanding of the RPM in magnetoreception, and discuss cryptochromes as the putative magnetosensitive molecules and their possible links to cancer-relevant biological processes. We then propose a hypothesis for explaining the link between ELF fields and childhood leukaemia, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current evidence, and make proposals for further research.","['Juutilainen, Jukka', 'Herrala, Mikko', 'Luukkonen, Jukka', 'Naarala, Jonne', 'Hore, P J']","['Juutilainen J', 'Herrala M', 'Luukkonen J', 'Naarala J', 'Hore PJ']","['Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland jukka.juutilainen@uef.fi.', 'Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Proc Biol Sci,Proceedings.

Activation of this receptor by a diverse group of cationic ligands such as neuropeptides, host defense peptides, and Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs contributes to chronic inflammatory diseases and pseudoallergic drug reactions. For most GPCRs, the extracellular (ECL) domains and their associated transmembrane (TM) domains display the greatest structural diversity and are responsible for binding different ligands. The goal of the current study was to determine if naturally occurring missense variants within MRGPRX2's ECL/TM domains contribute to gain or loss of function phenotype for MC degranulation in response to neuropeptides (substance P and hemokinin-1), a host defense peptide (human beta-defensin-3) and a Food and Drug Administration-approved cationic drug (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant). We have identified eight missense variants within MRGPRX2's ECL/TM domains from publicly available exome-sequencing databases. We investigated the ability of MRGPRX2 ligands to induce degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells individually expressing these naturally occurring MRGPRX2 missense variants. Using stable and transient transfections, we found that all variants express in rat basophilic leukemia cells. However, four natural MRGPRX2 variants, G165E (rs141744602), D184H (rs372988289), W243R (rs150365137), and H259Y (rs140862085) failed to respond to any of the ligands tested. Thus, diverse MRGPRX2 ligands use common sites on the receptor to induce MC degranulation. These findings have important clinical implications for MRGPRX2 and MC-mediated pseudoallergy and chronic inflammatory diseases.","['Alkanfari, Ibrahim', 'Gupta, Kshitij', 'Jahan, Tahsin', 'Ali, Hydar']","['Alkanfari I', 'Gupta K', 'Jahan T', 'Ali H']","['Department of Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 alih@upenn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180523,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bradykinin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Loss of Function Mutation/*drug effects', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects', 'Mutation, Missense/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide/*genetics/metabolism', 'Substance P/pharmacology', 'Tachykinins/pharmacology', 'beta-Defensins/pharmacology']",,,2018/05/26 06:00,2019/06/22 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1701793 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1701793 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Jul 15;201(2):343-349. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1701793.

SAMHD1 is highly expressed in resting CD4(+) T cells, which are important for the HIV-1 reservoir and viral latency; however, whether SAMHD1 affects HIV-1 latency is unknown. Recombinant SAMHD1 binds HIV-1 DNA or RNA fragments in vitro, but the function of this binding remains unclear. Here we investigate the effect of SAMHD1 on HIV-1 gene expression and reactivation of viral latency. We found that endogenous SAMHD1 impaired HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity in monocytic THP-1 cells and HIV-1 reactivation in latently infected primary CD4(+) T cells. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) SAMHD1 suppressed HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression at a transcriptional level. Tat coexpression abrogated SAMHD1-mediated suppression of HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase expression. SAMHD1 overexpression also suppressed the LTR activity of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), but not that of murine leukemia virus (MLV), suggesting specific suppression of retroviral LTR-driven gene expression. WT SAMHD1 bound to proviral DNA and impaired reactivation of HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected J-Lat cells. In contrast, a nonphosphorylated mutant (T592A) and a dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) inactive mutant (H206D R207N [HD/RN]) of SAMHD1 failed to efficiently suppress HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and reactivation of latent virus. Purified recombinant WT SAMHD1, but not the T592A and HD/RN mutants, bound to fragments of the HIV-1 LTR in vitro These findings suggest that SAMHD1-mediated suppression of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression potentially regulates viral latency in CD4(+) T cells.IMPORTANCE A critical barrier to developing a cure for HIV-1 infection is the long-lived viral reservoir that exists in resting CD4(+) T cells, the main targets of HIV-1. The viral reservoir is maintained through a variety of mechanisms, including regulation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. The host protein SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 replication in nondividing cells, but its role in HIV-1 latency remains unknown. Here we report a new function of SAMHD1 in regulating HIV-1 latency. We found that SAMHD1 suppressed HIV-1 LTR promoter-driven gene expression and reactivation of viral latency in cell lines and primary CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, SAMHD1 bound to the HIV-1 LTR in vitro and in a latently infected CD4(+) T-cell line, suggesting that the binding may negatively modulate reactivation of HIV-1 latency. Our findings indicate a novel role for SAMHD1 in regulating HIV-1 latency, which enhances our understanding of the mechanisms regulating proviral gene expression in CD4(+) T cells.","['Antonucci, Jenna M', 'Kim, Sun Hee', 'St Gelais, Corine', 'Bonifati, Serena', 'Li, Tai-Wei', 'Buzovetsky, Olga', 'Knecht, Kirsten M', 'Duchon, Alice A', 'Xiong, Yong', 'Musier-Forsyth, Karin', 'Wu, Li']","['Antonucci JM', 'Kim SH', 'St Gelais C', 'Bonifati S', 'Li TW', 'Buzovetsky O', 'Knecht KM', 'Duchon AA', 'Xiong Y', 'Musier-Forsyth K', 'Wu L']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA wu.840@osu.edu.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180717,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mutation, Missense', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Virus Latency/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*LTR', '*SAMHD1', '*gene expression', '*latency', '*reactivation']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00292-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00292-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jul 17;92(15). pii: JVI.00292-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00292-18.

This latter phenomenon plays a key role in HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) for high-risk acute leukemia patients transplanted from an NK-alloreactive donor. Different haplo-HSCT settings have been developed, either T depleted or T replete - the latter requiring graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. A novel graft manipulation, based on depletion of alphabeta T cells and B cells, allows infusion of fully mature, including alloreactive, NK cells.

CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old man presented with masses in his neck and right groin. Cutting needle biopsy of the inguinal mass revealed the three lymphoma types which were morphologically, immunophenotypically and topographically distinct. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified an IGH-BCL2 rearrangement in both the FL and high-grade B-cell components while a MYC rearrangement was detected in the high-grade B-cell component alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the high-grade lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations evolved through transformation of the FL by a process that entailed acquisition of the MYC translocation. No clonal relationship between the FL and CLL/SLL components was evident since the IGH-BCL2 rearrangement was present in in the former but not the latter. This unique case of co-localized FL, CLL/SLL, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma contributes to our understanding of the clonal relationships that may exist between the components of composite lymphomas.","['Moore, Alison M', 'Moshkin, Olga', 'Swain, Gordon J', 'Crocker, Susan', 'LeBrun, David P']","['Moore AM', 'Moshkin O', 'Swain GJ', 'Crocker S', 'LeBrun DP']","[""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", 'Peterborough Regional Health Centre, Peterborough, ON, Canada.', 'Peterborough Regional Health Centre, Peterborough, ON, Canada.', ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."", ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada. dpl1@queensu.ca.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180524,England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Composite Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Composite lymphoma', 'Cytogenetics', 'Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'Double-hit lymphoma', 'Follicular lymphoma', 'High-grade B-cell lymphoma', 'MYC', 'Small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2018/05/26 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13000-018-0714-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-018-0714-z [pii]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2018 May 24;13(1):34. doi: 10.1186/s13000-018-0714-z.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",,PMC5968498,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8695-0247'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will review the clinical studies using alpha-particle therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). METHODS: A series of clinical trials were conducted to assess the safety, feasibility, and anti-leukemic effects of lintuzumab, an anti-CD33 humanized monoclonal antibody, labeled with the alpha-emitters bismuth- 213 (213Bi) and actinium-225 (225Ac). RESULTS: An initial phase I study conducted in 18 patients with relapsed or refractory AML demonstrated the safety and antitumor effects of 213Bi-lintuzumab. Subsequently, 213Bi-lintuzumab produced remissions in AML patients after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine in phase I/II trial. The 46- minute half-life of 213Bi and need for an onsite generator has limited its utility. Therefore, a secondgeneration construct was developed using 225Ac, a radiometal that yields four alpha-particle emissions. A phase I trial demonstrated that a single infusion of 225Ac-lintuzumab could be given safely at doses up to 111 kBq/kg with anti-leukemic activity across all dose levels studied. In a second phase I study, 28% of older patients with untreated AML had objective responses after receiving fractionated-dose 225Aclintuzumab and low-dose cytarabine. CONCLUSION: Based upon the encouraging results seen in phase I trials of 225Ac-lintuzumab, a phase II study of 225Ac-lintuzumab monotherapy for older patients with untreated AML is now in progress and is also being studied in a subset of patients with CD33-positive multiple myeloma.","['Jurcic, Joseph G']",['Jurcic JG'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York- Presbyterian Hospital, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Radiopharm,Current radiopharmaceuticals,101468718,IM,"['Actinium/*pharmacology', 'Alpha Particles/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Bismuth/*pharmacology', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy', 'Radiochemistry/methods', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radioisotopes/*pharmacology', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Actinium-225', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bismuth-213', 'CD33', 'alpha-particle', 'radioimmunotherapy.']",2018/05/26 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/05/26 06:00'],"['2017/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['CRP-EPUB-90682 [pii]', '10.2174/1874471011666180525102814 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Radiopharm. 2018;11(3):192-199. doi: 10.2174/1874471011666180525102814.,"['0 (Actinium-225)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Bismuth-213)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', 'NIK1K0956U (Actinium)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)', 'V00Y10W60W (lintuzumab)']",,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); relapse occurs in approximately 20% of patients. Nowadays, epigenetic factors are considered as one of the most effective mechanisms in pathogenesis of malignancies. These factors are reversible elements which can be potentially regarded as therapy targets and disease prognosis. DNA methylation, which primarily serves as transcriptional suppressor, mostly occurs in CpG islands of the gene promoter regions. This was shown as a key epigenetic factor in inactivating various tumor suppressor genes during cancer initiation and progression. We aimed to review methylation status of key genes involved in hematopoietic malignancies such as IKZF1, CDKN2B, TET2, CYP1B1, SALL4, DLC1, DLX family, TP73, PTPN6, and CDKN1C; and their significance in pathogenesis of ALL. The DNA methylation alterations in promoter regions of the genes have been shown to play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Methylation -based inactivation of these genes has also been reported as associated with prognosis in acute leukemia. In this review, we also addressed the association of gene expression and methylation pattern in ALL patients.","['Rahmani, Mina', 'Talebi, Mehdi', 'Hagh, Majid Farshdousti', 'Feizi, Abbas A Hosseinpour', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Rahmani M', 'Talebi M', 'Hagh MF', 'Feizi AAH', 'Solali S']","['Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Stem cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

Several scores have been developed to predict outcome after allo-HSCT. The recently revised Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score is based on patient age, donor type, disease risk, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus of patient and donor, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive power of the PAM score in an independent large cohort of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We selected adult patients with AML who underwent a first allo-HSCT at the University Hospital of Dresden, a tertiary care hospital with a large transplantation program. All adult patients treated between January 1, 2003, and July 1, 2015, were included. The PAM score was calculated as described previously. Overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after allo-HSCT were analyzed. Age, AML type, sex match, CMV match, donor type, European Leukemia Net risk classification, type of conditioning, disease stage, and PAM score as a continuous variable were selected a priori for multivariate Cox regression analyses. A total of 544 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median patient age was 57 years. With a median follow-up of 47 months (range, 1 to 161 months), the estimated OS for the whole cohort at 4 years was 43%, with a CIR of 30% and an NRM of 31%. The probability of OS at 4 years was 65% for patients with a PAM score of 0, 52% in those with a PAM score of 1, 33% in those with a PAM score of 2, and 22% in those with a PAM score of 3 (P < .001, log-rank test). Both the CIR and NRM increased with higher PAM scores (P = .005 and P < .001, respectively, Gray test). In multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 per year; P = .004), disease stage (primary induction failure versus first complete remission (CR1); HR, 1.5; P = .03), and the PAM score (HR 1.04; P = .03) had a significant impact on OS. This is the first independent validation of the revised PAM score allowing for simple and valid estimation of transplantation outcomes. It can serve as an important tool in counseling patients with AML, as well as in designing future trials.","['Middeke, Jan M', 'Kollinger, Frederike', 'Baldauf, Henning', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Wermke, Martin', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Sockel, Katja', 'Link, Cornelia S', 'Teipel, Raphael', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes']","['Middeke JM', 'Kollinger F', 'Baldauf H', 'Stolzel F', 'Wermke M', 'von Bonin M', 'Sockel K', 'Link CS', 'Teipel R', 'Rollig C', 'Thiede C', 'Platzbecker U', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J']","['Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Dresden, Germany.

These compounds react with DNA and proteins, leading to genotoxic effects. We used the comet assay to monitor formation of cross-links in HL-60 cells treated with ECH, DEB, and the structurally related anti-cancer drug mechlorethamine (HN2). We report a time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity that correlated with cross-linking activity, following the order HN2>DEB>ECH. The rate of cross-link repair also varied with drug, with ECH-induced lesions the fastest to repair. High drug doses led to the formation of saturating amounts of HN2 cross-links that were repaired inefficiently. DEB and ECH produced fewer overall cross-links, but some were also resistant to repair. These persistent cross-links may activate cell-cycle arrest to allow repair of damage, with prolonged arrest triggering apoptosis. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that treatment of HL-60 cells with DEB and ECH results in up-regulation of several genes involved in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway, including BAX, BAK1, CASP-9, APAF-1, and BCL-2.

However, outcomes of aspirin monotherapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are inconsistent across studies. ABT-737, an BH3 mimetic inhibitor, is also a promising antitumor drug. Cancer cells including those from RCC, that have high levels of Mcl-1, are refractory to ABT-737-induced apoptosis. We here investigated how aspirin treatment modulates the ABT-737-induced apoptosis. Using the in vitro model of human 786-O cells, we showed that aspirin had sensitized cells to ABT-737 induced apoptosis. Such aspirin-induced changes of ABT-737 resistance was accompanied by a host of biochemical events like protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation, AKT dephosphorylation, Mcl-1/FLICE inhibiting protein (FLIP)/XIAP downregulation, and Bax mitochondrial redistribution. The PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, was able to reverse the apirin-induced apoptotic changes. Apart from the aspirin treatment, Mcl-1 silencing also rendered cells vulnerable to ABT-737 induced apoptosis.

PARs have been successfully employed in vitro to activate T cells for the selective killing of leukemia cells. However, PAR efficacy has yet to be evaluated in vivo or against solid tumors. Therefore, we developed bispecific PARs that selectively target the human CD3 receptor and human epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is overexpressed on multiple carcinomas and cancer stem cells. The alphaEpCAM/alphaCD3 PARs were found to stably bind T cells for >4 days, and treating EpCAM(+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells with alphaEpCAM/alphaCD3 PAR-functionalized T cells resulted in the induction of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and MCF-7 cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an orthotopic breast cancer model validated the ability of alphaEpCAM/alphaCD3 PAR therapy to direct T cell lytic activity toward EpCAM(+) breast cancer cells in vivo, leading to tumor eradication. In vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated that PAR-T cells were formed in vivo and persist for over 48 h with rapid accumulation in tumor tissue. Following PAR treatment, the production of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TNF-alpha could be significantly reduced by an infusion of clinically relevant concentrations of the FDA-approved antibiotic, trimethoprim, signaling pharmacologic PAR deactivation. Importantly, CSANs did not induce naive T cell activation and thus exhibit a limited potential to induce naive T cell anergy. In addition, murine immunogenicity studies demonstrated that CSANs do not induce a significant antibody response nor do they activate splenic cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that bispecific CSANs are able to nongenetically generate reversibly modified T cells that are capable of eradicating targeted solid tumors.","['Petersburg, Jacob R', 'Shen, Jingjing', 'Csizmar, Clifford M', 'Murphy, Katherine A', 'Spanier, Justin', 'Gabrielse, Kari', 'Griffith, Thomas S', 'Fife, Brian', 'Wagner, Carston R']","['Petersburg JR', 'Shen J', 'Csizmar CM', 'Murphy KA', 'Spanier J', 'Gabrielse K', 'Griffith TS', 'Fife B', 'Wagner CR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180604,United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Nanostructures/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology/*transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*EpCAM', '*T cell', '*anticancer', '*bispecific', '*immunotherapy', '*nanotechnology']",2018/05/25 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/05/25 06:00'],"['2018/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsnano.8b01308 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2018 Jul 24;12(7):6563-6576. doi: 10.1021/acsnano.8b01308.

In the last decades, the use of genetic and genomic approaches allowed the identification of patients with higher risk of recurrence after and/or resistance to CHT. However, though many novel drugs have been proposed and tested, only little clinical improvements have been made concerning the treatment of the so called 'high risk' patients. Areas covered: In this article, the authors, based on their own experience and the most updated literature, review the basic knowledge of AML prognostication and treatment prediction developed throughout genetic and genomic profiling, and focus on the use of gene expression profiling as a promising predictive tool. The role of next generation sequencing, run on qPCR/digital PCR platforms or polyvalent ones such as the Nanostring NCounter and RNA-sequencing techniques in the near future will also be briefly discussed. Expert commentary: The authors believe that a combination of genetic (including both germline and somatic data), epigenetic and transcriptional data will represent, in the future, the molecular basis for treatment decision with the highest predictive potential.","['Visani, Giuseppe', 'Loscocco, Federica', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo']","['Visani G', 'Loscocco F', 'Isidori A', 'Piccaluga PP']","['a Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Center , AORMN , Pesaro , Italy.', 'a Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Center , AORMN , Pesaro , Italy.', 'a Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Center , AORMN , Pesaro , Italy.', 'b Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, S.

The prepared gluCDMT exhibited large hydrophilic surface, high stability, and good acidic/alkalic resistance. A solid monolithic support was employed to immobilize gluCDMT by a host-guest self-assembly synthetic strategy, which did not occupy the surface hydrophilic sites. The gluCDMT-based monolith exhibited high binding capacity ( approximately 50 mg g(-1)), good ability to capture glycopeptides (23 HRP glycopeptides and 28 IgG glycopeptides), and high selectivity (horseradish peroxidase/bovine serum albumin = 1:10 000).

The Shb gene knockout has been found to accelerate p210 Breakpoint cluster region-cAbl oncogene 1 tyrosine kinase-induced leukemia. In human myeloid leukemia were tumors with high Src homology-2 domain protein B mRNA content, tumors were, however, associated with decreased latency and myeloid leukemia exhibiting immune cell characteristics. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Shb knockout on the development of leukemia in three additional models, that is, colony stimulating factor 3 receptor-T618I-induced neutrophilic leukemia, p190 Breakpoint cluster region-cAbl oncogene 1 tyrosine kinase-induced B-cell leukemia, and G12D-Kras-induced T-cell leukemia/thymic lymphoma. Wild-type or Shb knockout bone marrow cells expressing the oncogenes were transplanted to bone marrow-deficient recipients. Organs from moribund mice were collected and further analyzed. Shb knockout increased the development of CSF3R(T618I)-induced leukemia and increased the white blood cell count at the time of death. In the p190 Breakpoint cluster region-cAbl oncogene 1 tyrosine kinase B-cell model, Shb knockout reduced white blood cell counts without affecting latency, whereas in the G12D-Kras T-cell model, thymus size was increased without major effects on latency, suggesting that Shb knockout accelerates the development thymic lymphoma. Cytokine secretion plays a role in the progression of leukemia, and consequently Shb knockout bone marrows exhibited lower expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor and interleukin 6 in the neutrophilic model and interleukin 7 and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (C-X-C motif chemokine 12) in the B-cell model. It is concluded that in experimental mouse models, the absence of the Shb gene exacerbates the disease in myeloid leukemia, whereas it alters the disease characteristics without affecting latency in B- and T-cell leukemia. The results suggest a role of Shb in modulating the disease characteristics depending on the oncogenic insult operating on hematopoietic cells. These findings help explain the outcome of human disease in relation to Src homology-2 domain protein B mRNA content.","['Jamalpour, Maria', 'Li, Xiujuan', 'Gustafsson, Karin', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Welsh, Michael']","['Jamalpour M', 'Li X', 'Gustafsson K', 'Tyner JW', 'Welsh M']","['1 Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', '1 Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', '2 Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', '3 Center for Regenerative Medicine and the Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, USA.', '4 Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', '1 Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Myeloid leukemia', 'Src homology-2 domain protein B', 'cytokines', 'lymphocytic/lymphoblastic leukemia', 'signal transduction']",2018/05/25 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2018/05/25 06:00'],"['2018/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428318771472 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2018 Apr;40(4):1010428318771472. doi: 10.1177/1010428318771472.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Shb protein, mouse)']",,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5467-9755'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The precise mechanism responsible for the sex difference needs to be determined. Female and male mice were given ethanol by intragastric infusion every day for 4 weeks. The pathological changes were detected by hematoxylin-eosin, Sirius red, oil red O, periodic acid-Schiff, and Hochest33258 staining in the liver of female and male mice. The related gene and protein expression of hepatocytes stress, proliferation and apoptosis, glycogen synthesis, lipid metabolism, and hepatic fibrosis were also systematically analyzed in the female and male mice. Livers from ethanol-treated female mice had more serious hepatocyte necrosis, liver fibrosis ( P < 0.01), substantial micro/macrovesicular steatosis ( p < 0.01), glycogen consumption ( p < 0.05), and hepatocytes apoptosis ( p < 0.05) than ethanol-treated male mice. The expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP70, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and phosphorylated signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) was higher in ethanol-treated male mice than ethanol-treated female mice ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). But, the expression of Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), Caspase 3, CYP2E1 (cytochrome P4502E1), and transforming growth factor betal had the contrary results.

In continuation of our efforts in identifying the new small molecule antiviral and anticancer agents, we identified chalcones as potent antiviral and anticancer agents. OBJECTIVE: With the aim of identifying the broad acting antiviral and anticancer agents, we discovered substituted aryl/heteroaryl derived thienyl chalcones as antiviral and anticancer agents. METHOD: A focused set of thienyl chalcone derivaties II-VI was screened for selected viruses Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Dengue virus 2 (DENV2), Influenza A (H1N1) virus, MERS coronavirus, Poliovirus 1 (PV 1), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Tacaribe virus (TCRV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and Zika virus (ZIKV) using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) antiviral screening program. Additionally, a cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has been screened for 60 human cancer cell lines using the Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) of NCI. RESULTS: All thienyl chalcone derivatives II-VI displayed moderate to excellent antiviral activity towards several viruses tested. Compounds V and VI were turned out be active compounds towards human cytomegalovirus for both normal strain (AD169) as well as resistant isolate (GDGr K17). Particularly, cyano derivative V showed very high potency (EC50: <0.05 microM) towards AD169 strain of HCMV compared to standard drug Ganciclovir (EC50: 0.12 microM). Additionally, it showed moderate activity in the secondary assay (AD169; EC50: 2.30 microM). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV displayed high potency towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Tacaribe virus (TCRV) towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV is nearly 28 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: 0.39 microg/ml) and nearly 17 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: 0.71 mug/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 11 microg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 12 microg/ml; neutral red assay). It is nearly 12 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: >1 microg/ml) and nearly 8 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: >1.3 microg/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 12 microg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 9.9 microg/ml; neutral red assay) towards Tacaribe virus (TCRV). Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has shown strong growth inhibitory activity towards three major cancers (colon, breast, and leukemia) cell lines and moderate growth inhibition shown towards other cancer cell lines screened. CONCLUSION: Compounds V and VI were demonstrated viral inhibition towards Human cytomegalovirus, whereas cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV towards Rift Valley fever virus and Tacaribe virus. Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has displayed very good cytotoxicity against colon, breast and leukemia cell lines in vitro.","['Patil, Vikrant', 'Patil, Siddappa A', 'Patil, Renukadevi', 'Bugarin, Alejandro', 'Beaman, Kenneth', 'Patil, Shivaputra A']","['Patil V', 'Patil SA', 'Patil R', 'Bugarin A', 'Beaman K', 'Patil SA']","['Centre for Nano and Material Sciences, Jain University, Jain Global Campus, Kanakapura, Ramanagaram, Bangalore 562112, India.', 'Centre for Nano and Material Sciences, Jain University, Jain Global Campus, Kanakapura, Ramanagaram, Bangalore 562112, India.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, College of Pharmacy, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, 3333 Green Bay Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, 3333 Green Bay Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, United States.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, College of Pharmacy, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, 3333 Green Bay Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Viruses/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer', 'antiviral', 'aryl/heteroaryl', 'colon', 'structure-activity relationship', 'thienyl chalcone.']",2018/05/25 06:00,2019/03/05 06:00,['2018/05/25 06:00'],"['2017/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-90639 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406414666180524074648 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2019;15(2):150-161. doi: 10.2174/1573406414666180524074648.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)']",,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alemtuzumab treatment was initiated during infusion number 18, the patient showed cutaneous eruption with a miliary pattern, despite premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines. The eruption returned with successive alemtuzumab infusions (infusions 19, 20 and 21), remained present for longer and was more severe with each infusion. The patient was referred to our Allergy Unit as it was necessary to maintain alemtuzumab treatment. Total immunoglobulin E level was 3 UI/ml and specific immunoglobulin E against more common pneumo-allergens, food, latex and hamster were inferior to 0.35 UI/ml. Prick test using the undiluted drug (30 mg/ml) and intradermal tests using serial dilutions (1/10, 1/100) were performed. The result of alemtuzumab skin prick test was 4 mm. The intradermal skin test result was positive at 1/100 dilution (papule: 8 mm; erythema: 12 mm). The basophil activation test with alemtuzumab was performed concluding that 10% of the basophils were activated by alemtuzumab. The patient underwent alemtuzumab desensitization according to a 12-step protocol that resolved to be safe and efficacious. Our experience may be helpful for similar clinical cases where the therapeutic options are very limited and a life-threatening condition such T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia is present.

Therefore, studying combinations of novel agents (NAs) with a distinct mechanism of action and nonoverlapping toxicities is challenging. Area covered: The 2017 American Society Hematology Annual Meeting has represented a showcase for several trials combining NAs. These studies are currently evaluating the efficacy NA plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, NA plus NA (with or without anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), and NA plus chemo-immunotherapy. Expert commentary: The development of well-tolerated, highly effective combination strategies with curative potential for patients with CLL is becoming a realistic goal in CLL. From a practical standpoint, it is hard to determine which regimen will be most beneficial. Until studies of association will provide more mature results, the sequencing of NA remains a reasonable approach.","['Molica, Stefano']",['Molica S'],"['a Department Hematology-Oncology , Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio , Catanzaro , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180606,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Congresses as Topic', 'Hematology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Societies, Medical', 'United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ASH 2017', '*CLL', '*combination novel agents', '*ibrutinib', '*venetoclax']",2018/05/24 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1480364 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Jun;11(6):481-486. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1480364.

METHODS: Neurocognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were obtained in 165 survivors five or more years postdiagnosis (average age = 14.4 years, 7.7 years from diagnosis, 51.5% males). Chemotherapy exposure was measured as serum concentration of methotrexate following high-dose intravenous injection. Neurocognitive testing included measures of attention and executive function. fMRI was obtained during completion of two tasks, the continuous performance task (CPT) and the attention network task (ANT). Image analysis was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software, with contrasts targeting sustained attention, alerting, orienting, and conflict. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with population norms, survivors demonstrated impairment on number-letter switching (P < .001, a measure of cognitive flexibility), which was associated with treatment intensity (P = .048). Task performance during fMRI was associated with neurocognitive dysfunction across multiple tasks. Regional brain activation was lower in survivors diagnosed at younger ages for the CPT (bilateral parietal and temporal lobes) and the ANT (left parietal and right hippocampus). With higher serum methotrexate exposure, CPT activation decreased in the right temporal and bilateral frontal and parietal lobes, but ANT alerting activation increased in the ventral frontal, insula, caudate, and anterior cingulate. CONCLUSIONS: Brain activation during attention and executive function tasks was associated with serum methotrexate exposure and age at diagnosis. These findings provide evidence for compromised and compensatory changes in regional brain function that may help clarify the neural substrates of cognitive deficits in acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors.","['Fellah, Slim', 'Cheung, Yin T', 'Scoggins, Matthew A', 'Zou, Ping', 'Sabin, Noah D', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Ogg, Robert J', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Fellah S', 'Cheung YT', 'Scoggins MA', 'Zou P', 'Sabin ND', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Ogg RJ', 'Krull KR']","[""Departments of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Departments of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Departments of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Departments of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Departments of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/chemically induced/*pathology/psychology', 'Brain/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Executive Function/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/psychology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/24 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['5001111 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djy089 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Feb 1;111(2):201-209. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djy089.,,,PMC6376909,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

MATERAILS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with primary acute myeloid leukemia had been randomized into busulfan/fludarabine and modified busulfan/cyclophosphamide groups. We retrospectively compared hematopoietic engraftment, regimen-related toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related mortality, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival between the groups. RESULTS: All patients achieved engraftment with 100% donor chimerism. The median times for the neutrophil and platelet engraftment in the busulfan/fludarabine and modified busulfan/cyclophosphamide groups were 14.1 versus 14.3 days and 12.7 versus 12.2 days, respectively. Significantly lower incidences of pretreatment toxicity, blood transfusion, and virus activation were observed in the busulfan/fludarabine group. Acute grade 1 graft-versus-host-disease developed in all patients, which was successfully controlled with methylprednisolone. There were no significant differences in engraftment, graft-versus-host disease, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival between groups. Both of these conditioning regimens achieved stable engraftment. Regimen-related toxicity in the busulfan/fludarabine group was well tolerated compared with that in the modified busulfan/cyclophosphamide group, without an increase in relapse rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that myeloablative busulfan/fludarabine might be a highly effective and low-toxicity alternative for patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Jiang, Yujie', 'Fang, Xiaosheng', 'Sui, Xiaohui', 'Liu, Xin', 'Li, Ying', 'Wang, Xianghua', 'Xu, Hongzhi', 'Zhang, Lingyan', 'Wang, Xin']","['Jiang Y', 'Fang X', 'Sui X', 'Liu X', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Xu H', 'Zhang L', 'Wang X']","['From the Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180523,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'China', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/24 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.6002/ect.2017.0100 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2018 Dec;16(6):736-744. doi: 10.6002/ect.2017.0100.

Recently, cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been explored as an effective treatment for CNS diseases. Among the various tissue-derived MSCs, we have isolated human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in our laboratory. In addition, we have focused on simulated microgravity (MG) as a valuable culture environment of MSCs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying functional recovery from transplantation of MSCs cultured under MG conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice. Human cMSCs were cultured under 1G and MG conditions, and cMSCs cultured under MG conditions expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). In TBI model mice, the transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions (group MG) showed greater motor functional improvement compared with only phosphate-buffered saline administration (group PBS). Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) ratio were significantly lower at brain injury sites in mice of group MG than those of group PBS. In addition, an in vitro study showed that the conditioned medium of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions significantly suppressed the cell death of NG108-15 cells exposed to oxidative or inflammatory stress through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects. These findings demonstrate that culturing cMSCs under simulated MG increases the neuroprotective effects, suggesting that simulated MG cultures may be a useful method for cell-based therapy strategies for CNS diseases.","['Otsuka, Takashi', 'Imura, Takeshi', 'Nakagawa, Kei', 'Shrestha, Looniva', 'Takahashi, Shinya', 'Kawahara, Yumi', 'Sueda, Taijiro', 'Kurisu, Kaoru', 'Yuge, Louis']","['Otsuka T', 'Imura T', 'Nakagawa K', 'Shrestha L', 'Takahashi S', 'Kawahara Y', 'Sueda T', 'Kurisu K', 'Yuge L']","['1 Division of Bio-Environmental Adaptation Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University , Hiroshima, Japan .', '1 Division of Bio-Environmental Adaptation Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University , Hiroshima, Japan .', '1 Division of Bio-Environmental Adaptation Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University , Hiroshima, Japan .', '1 Division of Bio-Environmental Adaptation Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University , Hiroshima, Japan .', '2 Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital , Hiroshima, Japan .', '3 Space Bio-Laboratories Co., Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan .', '2 Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Hiroshima University Hospital , Hiroshima, Japan .', '4 Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University , Hiroshima, Japan .', '1 Division of Bio-Environmental Adaptation Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, Hiroshima University , Hiroshima, Japan .', '3 Space Bio-Laboratories Co., Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180705,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone and Bones/cytology', 'Brain Injuries, Traumatic/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Humans', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Neuroprotective Agents/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Regeneration/genetics/physiology', 'Skull/cytology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*mesenchymal stem cells', '*neuroprotection', '*simulated microgravity']",2018/05/24 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2017.0299 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2018 Sep 15;27(18):1287-1297. doi: 10.1089/scd.2017.0299.

A second goal was to analyze the potential modulatory roles of different fatty acids, including oleic, palmitic, eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA), on the expression of these miRNAs in the three cell types. This hypothesis was tested in human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1), which were differentiated into macrophages with 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and further activated with LPS for 24 h. Monocytes, macrophages, and AcM were transfected with a negative control, or mimics for miR-155-3p and miR-let-7b-5p. The expression of both miRNAs and some proinflammatory genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, let-7b mimic reduced the expression of IL6 and TNF in monocytes, and SERPINE1 expression in LPS-activated macrophages. However, IL6, TNF, and SERPINE1 were upregulated in macrophages by let-7b mimic. IL6 expression was higher in the three types of cells after transfecting with miR-155-3p mimic. Similarly, expression of SERPINE1 was increased by miR-155-3p mimic in monocytes and macrophages. However, TLR4 was downregulated by miR-155-3p in monocytes and macrophages. Regarding the effects of the different fatty acids, oleic acid increased the expression of let-7b in macrophages and AcM and also increased the expression of miR-155 in monocytes when compared with DHA but not when compared with non-treated cells. Overall, these results suggest anti- and proinflammatory roles of let-7b and miR-155-3p in THP-1 cells, respectively, although these outcomes are strongly dependent on the cell type. Noteworthy, oleic acid might exert beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells (i.e., non-activated and LPS-activated macrophages) by upregulating the expression of let-7b.","['Marques-Rocha, J L', 'Garcia-Lacarte, M', 'Samblas, M', 'Bressan, J', 'Martinez, J A', 'Milagro, F I']","['Marques-Rocha JL', 'Garcia-Lacarte M', 'Samblas M', 'Bressan J', 'Martinez JA', 'Milagro FI']","['Department of Integrated Education of Health, Federal University of Espirito Santo, Vitoria, Brazil.', 'Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology; Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, c / Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', 'Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology; Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, c / Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health, Federal University of Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil.', 'Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology; Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, c / Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.', 'CIBERobn, Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y la Nutricion, Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain.', 'IdiSNA, Navarra Institute for Health Research, Pamplona, Spain.', 'IMDEA Food, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Nutrition, Food Science and Physiology; Centre for Nutrition Research, University of Navarra, c / Irunlarrea 1, 31008, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain. fmilagro@unav.es.', 'CIBERobn, Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y la Nutricion, Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain. fmilagro@unav.es.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180522,Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Oleic Acid/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/agonists/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['DHA', 'EPA', 'Macrophages', 'Monocytes', 'Oleic acid', 'SERPINE1']",2018/05/24 06:00,2019/01/10 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13105-018-0629-x [doi]', '10.1007/s13105-018-0629-x [pii]']",ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2018 Nov;74(4):579-589. doi: 10.1007/s13105-018-0629-x.

The maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis relies on accurate alternative splicing, and various patterns of abnormal alternative splicing can cause different diseases. SRSF4 is associated with many physiological and pathological processes and has applications in the diagnosis and prognosis of specific diseases.

Here, we show that Small MSCs primed with Hypoxia and Calcium ions (SHC-MSCs) exhibit enhanced stemness and immunomodulatory functions for treating allogeneic conflicts. Compared with naive cultured human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs, SHC-MSCs were resistant to passage-dependent senescence mediated via the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and p53/p21 cascade and secreted large amounts of pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, resulting in suppression of T-cell proliferation. SHC-MSCs showed DNA demethylation in pluripotency, germline, and imprinted genes similarly to very small embryonic-like stem cells, suggesting a potential mutual relationship. Genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses indicated that genes related to immune modulation, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle were up-regulated in SHC-MSCs. Particularly, polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1), zinc-finger protein-143, dehydrogenase/reductase-3, and friend-of-GATA2 play a key role in the beneficial effects of SHC-MSCs. Administration of SHC-MSCs or PLK1-overexpressing MSCs significantly ameliorated symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a humanized mouse model, resulting in significantly improved survival, less weight loss, and reduced histopathologic injuries in GVHD target organs compared with naive MSC-infused mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that SHC-MSCs can improve the clinical treatment of allogeneic conflicts, including GVHD.","['Kim, YongHwan', 'Jin, Hye Jin', 'Heo, Jinbeom', 'Ju, Hyein', 'Lee, Hye-Yeon', 'Kim, Sujin', 'Lee, Seungun', 'Lim, Jisun', 'Jeong, Sang Young', 'Kwon, JiHye', 'Kim, Miyeon', 'Choi, Soo Jin', 'Oh, Wonil', 'Yang, Yoon Sun', 'Hwang, Hyun Ho', 'Yu, Hwan Yeul', 'Ryu, Chae-Min', 'Jeon, Hong Bae', 'Shin, Dong-Myung']","['Kim Y', 'Jin HJ', 'Heo J', 'Ju H', 'Lee HY', 'Kim S', 'Lee S', 'Lim J', 'Jeong SY', 'Kwon J', 'Kim M', 'Choi SJ', 'Oh W', 'Yang YS', 'Hwang HH', 'Yu HY', 'Ryu CM', 'Jeon HB', 'Shin DM']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Jeddah, 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, MEDIPOST Co., Ltd, Seongnam, 13494, Korea. jhb@medi-post.co.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea. d0shin03@amc.seoul.kr.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Korea. d0shin03@amc.seoul.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180522,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,,2018/05/24 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0151-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0151-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Dec;32(12):2672-2684. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0151-8.

Translocations and copy number abnormalities (CNAs) had a preponderant contribution over gene mutations in defining the genotype and prognosis of each case. Known and novel independent prognostic markers were identified in our cohort of proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug-treated patients with long follow-up, including events with context-specific prognostic value, such as deletions of the PRDM1 gene.

To increase the potency of adoptively transferred T cells, patients are conditioned with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimens prior to adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT), and data suggest that fludarabine is an important component of an effective regimen. In a recent clinical trial using CAR-T cells engineered to target the CD19 B-cell antigen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, JCAR-015 (NCT02535364), two patient deaths due to cerebral edema led to trial suspension. The lymphodepleting agent fludarabine was suggested as the causative agent, in part due to its known association with neurotoxicity and its ability to induce greater potency. In a similar CAR-T study also incorporating fludarabine in the preconditioning regimen, ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216), one patient died of cerebral edema. However, subsequent deaths in the JCAR-015 study after removal of fludarabine and improved understanding behind the mechanisms of CAR-T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) indicate that fludarabine is not the primary causative agent of cerebral edema and that it can be safely incorporated into the preconditioning regimen for ACT. Since entering clinical use in the late 1980s as a chemotherapy agent, fludarabine and similar analogs have been associated with lethal neurological toxicity, yet the manifestation and timing of symptoms are distinct to those observed recently in ACT. Herein, we review the history of fludarabine development as a chemotherapeutic agent, and discuss the safety of its continued use in preconditioning regimens for ACT.","['Lowe, Kate L', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Norry, Elliot', 'Amado, Rafael', 'Jakobsen, Bent K', 'Binder, Gwendolyn']","['Lowe KL', 'Mackall CL', 'Norry E', 'Amado R', 'Jakobsen BK', 'Binder G']","['Immunocore, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Adaptimmune, Oxford, UK, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Adaptimmune, Oxford, UK, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Adaptimmune, Oxford, UK, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Adaptimmune, Oxford, UK, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Development of novel approach to combat this disease is urgently required. Vorinostat, a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, exerts promising anticancer activity in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. However, the efficacy of vorinostat monotherapy is unsatisfactory. Here, we show that quinacrine (QC), an anti-malaria drug with potent autophagy inhibitory activity, could synergistically enhance vorinostat-induced cell death at a non-toxic concentration. Compared to the single treatment, QC plus vorinostat significantly induced apoptosis, disrupted the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Interestingly, the application of QC plus vorinostat resulted in mitophagy blockade, as reflected by the increase in the K63-linked ubiquitination of mitochondria protein and the formation of mitochondrial aggresomes. QC plus vorinostat markedly increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in cells. Moreover, the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abrogated QC plus vorinostat-induced ROS, decreased the ubiquitination of mitochondria proteins, and cell death. Finally, using a xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that QC plus vorinostat significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced cell death in vivo. Taken together, our results showed that the combination of QC with vorinostat may represent a novel regimen for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which deserves clinical evaluation in the future.","['Jing, Bo', 'Jin, Jin', 'Xiang, Rufang', 'Liu, Meng', 'Yang, Li', 'Tong, Yin', 'Xiao, Xinhua', 'Lei, Hu', 'Liu, Wei', 'Xu, Hanzhang', 'Deng, Jiong', 'Zhou, Li', 'Wu,

However, most published trials have employed high cumulative doses of anthracyclines. Here, we report the outcome of newly diagnosed APL patients enrolled in the International Consortium for Childhood APL (ICC-APL-01) trial, which reduced anthracycline exposure but extended that of ATRA. The study recruited 258 children/adolescents with molecularly/cytogenetically proven APL. Patients were stratified into standard-risk (SR) and high-risk (HR) groups according to baseline white blood cell counts (<10 x 10(9)/L or >/=10 x 10(9)/L); both groups received identical induction treatment with ATRA and 3 doses of idarubicin. Two or 3 blocks of consolidation therapy were administered to SR and HR patients, respectively, while maintenance therapy with low-dose chemotherapy and ATRA cycles was given to all patients for 2 years. The cumulative dose of daunorubicin equivalent anthracyclines in SR and HR patients was lower than that of previous studies (355 mg/m(2) and 405 mg/m(2), respectively). Hematologic remission was obtained in 97% of patients; 8 children died of intracranial hemorrhage in the first 2 weeks following diagnosis. Five-year overall and event-free survival for the whole cohort were 94.6% and 79.9%, respectively; they were 98.4% and 89.4% in SR patients and 84.3% and 74.2% in HR patients (P = .002 and P = .043, respectively).

A recent study of 560 breast cancers identified 82 genes with 916 point mutations as drivers in the genesis of this malignancy. Because estrogens play a major role in breast cancer development and are also known to regulate the expression of numerous genes, we hypothesize that the 82 driver genes are likely to be influenced by estrogens, such as 17ss-estradiol (E2), and the estrogen receptor ESR1 (ERalpha). Because different types of tumors are characterized by unique sets of cancer driver genes, we also argue that the fraction of driver genes regulated by E2-ESR1 is lower in malignancies not associated with estrogens, e.g., acute myeloid leukemia (AML).Methods: We performed a literature search of each driver gene to determine its E2-ESR1 regulation.Results: Fifty-three of the 82 driver genes (64.6%) identified in breast cancers showed evidence of E2-ESR1 regulation. In contrast, only 19 of 54 mutated driver genes (35.2%) identified in AML were linked to E2-ESR1. Among the 916 driver mutations found in breast cancers, 813 (88.8%) were linked to E2-ESR1 compared with 2,046 of 3,833 in AML (53.4%).Conclusions: Risk assessment revealed that mutations in estrogen-regulated genes are much more likely to be associated with elevated breast cancer risk, while mutations in unregulated genes are more likely to be associated with AML.Impact: These results increase the plausibility that estrogens promote breast cancer development.

Lenalidomide (CC5013, Revlimid(R)) was approved by the US FDA and the EMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, low or intermediate-1 risk transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with chromosome 5q deletion [del(5q)] and relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma following bortezomib. Lenalidomide has also been studied in clinical trials and has shown promising activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Lenalidomide has anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits angiogenesis. Pomalidomide (CC4047, Imnovid(R) [EU], Pomalyst(R) [USA]) was approved for advanced MM insensitive to bortezomib and lenalidomide. Other IMiDs are in phases 1 and 2 of clinical trials. Cereblon (CRBN) seems to have an important role in IMiDs action in both lymphoid and myeloid hematological malignancies. Cereblon acts as the substrate receptor of a cullin-4 really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4CRBN. This E3 ubiquitin ligase in the absence of lenalidomide ubiquitinates CRBN itself and the other components of CRL4CRBN complex. Presence of lenalidomide changes specificity of CRL4CRBN which ubiquitinates two transcription factors, IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos), and casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) and marks them for degradation in proteasomes. Both these transcription factors (IKZF1 and IKZF3) stimulate proliferation of MM cells and inhibit T cells. Low CRBN level was connected with insensitivity of MM cells to lenalidomide. Lenalidomide decreases expression of protein argonaute-2, which binds to cereblon. Argonaute-2 seems to be an important drug target against IMiDs resistance in MM cells. Lenalidomide decreases also basigin and monocarboxylate transporter 1 in MM cells. MM cells with low expression of Ikaros, Aiolos and basigin are more sensitive to lenalidomide treatment. The CK1alpha gene (CSNK1A1) is located on 5q32 in commonly deleted region (CDR) in del(5q) MDS. Inhibition of CK1alpha sensitizes del(5q) MDS cells to lenalidomide. CK1alpha mediates also survival of malignant plasma cells in MM. Though, inhibition of CK1alpha is a potential novel therapy not only in del(5q) MDS but also in MM. High level of full length CRBN mRNA in mononuclear cells of bone marrow and of peripheral blood seems to be necessary for successful therapy of del(5q) MDS with lenalidomide. While transfusion independence (TI) after lenalidomide treatment is more than 60% in MDS patients with del(5q), only 25% TI and substantially shorter duration of response with occurrence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were achieved in lower risk MDS patients with normal karyotype treated with lenalidomide. Shortage of the biomarkers for lenalidomide response in these MDS patients is the main problem up to now.","['Fuchs, Ota']",['Fuchs O'],"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunomodulation/*drug effects', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cereblon', '*Ikaros family', '*casein kinase 1alpha1', '*cullin 4-containing RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex', '*del(5q) MDS', '*immunomodulatory drugs', '*lenalidomide', '*mantle lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma', '*pomalidomide', '*proteasome.']",2018/05/24 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['CHDDT-EPUB-90570 [pii]', '10.2174/1871529X18666180522073855 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2019;19(1):51-78. doi: 10.2174/1871529X18666180522073855.,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its histologic features are clearly defined, but there are few studies regarding its immunohistochemical characteristics. The present study investigated the immunohistochemical characteristics of 21 cases of FISS. METHODS: FISSs from 12 male and nine female cats, 20 mixed-breed and one Siamese, were included in the study. After histopathological diagnosis, additional histologic sections were immunostained for vimentin, cytokeratin, desmin, S100 protein, viral feline leukemia virus (FeLV) particles, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and c-KIT. Positive and negative controls were adopted accordingly. Immunostainings were classified as positive or negative according to the number of positive cells from a total of 1000 cells per tumor section. RESULTS: Histopathologic diagnosis of the tumors revealed 18 (85.7%) fibrosarcomas and three (14.3%) other sarcomas; four fibrosarcomas (22.2%) were grade III, five (27.8%) were grade II and nine (50.0%) were grade I. Two sarcomas were grade III and one was grade II. Seventeen (81%) tumors were negative for desmin. All samples were positive for vimentin. Twenty tumors (95.2%) were positive for S-100 protein. Positivity for c-KIT was observed in four (19%) samples; COX-2 was positive in 13 (61.9%) and FeLV viral particles were positive in nine (42.9%) FISSs.

Differentially expressed miRNAs between gastric MALT lymphoma samples and human tonsil tissue samples as well as their target genes were identified. The transcriptional regulatory relationships between miRNAs and target genes were analyzed, and the regulatory network between them was constructed. Target genes annotated as transcription factors (TFs) were screened, and an miRNA-target gene regulatory network was established. Moreover, the expression levels of miRNAs and target genes as well as the correlation between them were verified. In total, 53 upregulated and 25 downregulated miRNAs were obtained, for which 35 and 25 experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, respectively, were screened. Some miRNAs were significantly enriched in certain pathways; for example, miR-320a was enriched in systemic lupus erythematosus and ribosome, miR-622 in the p53 signaling pathway and chronic myeloid leukemia, and miR-429 in cancer-related pathways. In addition, upregulated miRNAs, including miR-320a, miR-940, and miR-622, and downregulated miRNAs, including miR-331-3p and miR-429, were hub nodes in the miRNA-target gene regulatory network, and the TF MYC was a co-target of miR-320a, miR-622, and miR-429. The expression trends of miR-320a and miR-429 as well as of some of their target genes were consistent with those in the results of microarray analysis. In conclusion, miR-320a, miR-622, and miR-429 are possibly novel miRNAs participating in the pathomechanism of gastric MALT lymphoma.","['Zhang, Y', 'Liu, A', 'E, M', 'Quan, L', 'Qu, Y', 'Gu, A']","['Zhang Y', 'Liu A', 'E M', 'Quan L', 'Qu Y', 'Gu A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2018/05/24 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2017/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4149/neo_2018_170208N89 [doi]', '170208N89 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2018 Mar 14;65(3):339-348. doi: 10.4149/neo_2018_170208N89.,"['0 (MIRN320 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN429 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN622 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), several well-established clinical and biologic prognostic variables have traditionally been used to risk stratify therapy for individual patients. While this approach has been very successful, many relapses still occur unpredictably in patients characterized as having favorable features of their disease at diagnosis. Furthermore, it is likely that other children are overtreated. Therefore, current initiatives in childhood leukemia have focused on identifying new prognostic markers to refine treatment decision-making. Recent advances, which include the sequencing of the human genome, and technical developments in high-throughput genomics and proteomics, have facilitated these efforts. This review will chart the evolution of individualized therapy for ALL, the most common malignancy of children.","['Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Min, Dong-Joon', 'Carroll, William L']","['Raetz EA', 'Bhojwani D', 'Min DJ', 'Carroll WL']","[""New York University School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology, The Stephen D Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, 317 East 34th Street, New York, NY 10016, USA. william.carroll@nyumc.org."", 'Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, New York, NY 10029, USA.', ""New York University School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology, The Stephen D Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, 317 East 34th Street, New York, NY 10016, USA. william.carroll@nyumc.org."", 'Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, New York, NY 10029, USA.', ""New York University School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology, The Stephen D Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, 317 East 34th Street, New York, NY 10016, USA. william.carroll@nyumc.org."", 'Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, New York, NY 10029, USA.', ""New York University School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology, The Stephen D Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, 317 East 34th Street, New York, NY 10016, USA. william.carroll@nyumc.org."", 'Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Per Med,Personalized medicine,101238549,,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'gene expression profiling', 'pharmacogenetics', 'proteomics', 'risk-stratified therapy']",2005/11/01 00:00,2005/11/01 00:01,['2018/05/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2005/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/17410541.2.4.349 [doi]'],ppublish,Per Med. 2005 Nov;2(4):349-361. doi: 10.2217/17410541.2.4.349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous evidence has shown that USP22 is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis in glioma. The effect and mechanism of USP22 in glioma malignancy, especially cancer stemness, remain elusive. Herein, we find USP22 is more enriched in stem-like tumorspheres than differentiated glioma cells. USP22 knockdown inhibits cancer stemness in glioma cell lines. With a cell-penetrating TAT-tag protein, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1), a robust glioma stem-cell marker, is found to mediate the effect of USP22 on glioma stemness. By immunofluorescence, USP22 and BMI1 are found to share similar intranuclear expression in glioma cells. By analysis with immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics, USP22 is found to positively correlate with BMI1 at the post-translational level only rather than at the transcriptional level. By immunoprecipitation and in vivo deubiquitination assay, USP22 is found to interact with and deubiquitinate BMI1 for protein stabilization. Microarray analysis shows that USP22 and BMI1 mutually regulate a series of genes involved in glioma stemness such as POSTN, HEY2, PDGFRA and ATF3. In vivo study with nude mice confirms the role of USP22 in promoting glioma tumorigenesis by regulating BMI1. All these findings indicate USP22 as a novel deubiquitinase of BMI1 in glioma. We propose a working model of the USP22-BMI1 axis, which promotes glioma stemness and tumorigenesis through oncogenic activation. Thus, targeting USP22 might be an effective strategy to treat glioma especially in those with elevated BMI1 expression.","['Qiu, Guan-Zhong', 'Mao, Xiao-Yuan', 'Ma, Yue', 'Gao, Xing-Chun', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Jin, Ming-Zhu', 'Sun, Wei', 'Zou, Yong-Xiang', 'Lin, Jing', 'Fu, Hua-Lin', 'Jin, Wei-Lin']","['Qiu GZ', 'Mao XY', 'Ma Y', 'Gao XC', 'Wang Z', 'Jin MZ', 'Sun W', 'Zou YX', 'Lin J', 'Fu HL', 'Jin WL']","['Department of Instrument Science and Engineering, Key Lab. for Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Electronic Information and Electronic Engineering, Institute of Nano Biomedicine and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of Jinan Military Command, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Human Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Instrument Science and Engineering, Key Lab. for Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Electronic Information and Electronic Engineering, Institute of Nano Biomedicine and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', ""Shanxi Key Laboratory of Ischemic Cardiovascular Disease, Institute of Basic Medical Medicine, Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."", 'Department of Instrument Science and Engineering, Key Lab. for Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Electronic Information and Electronic Engineering, Institute of Nano Biomedicine and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The General Hospital of Western Air Force, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Instrument Science and Engineering, Key Lab. for Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Electronic Information and Electronic Engineering, Institute of Nano Biomedicine and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'National Centers for Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Instrument Science and Engineering, Key Lab. for Thin Film and Microfabrication Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Electronic Information and Electronic Engineering, Institute of Nano Biomedicine and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'National Centers for Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180628,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glioma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncogene Proteins', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",['NOTNLM'],"['BMI1', 'USP22', 'cancer stemness', 'deubiquitination', 'glioma']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/07/25 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13646 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Jul;109(7):2199-2210. doi: 10.1111/cas.13646.

Recently, severe hemangiomas broke out in Hy-Line layer chickens on a poultry farm in 2017 where ALV was eradicated earlier. Six isolates of ALV-J, named SDAU1701-SDAU1706, were characterized by virus isolation and sequence analysis of the complete proviral genomes. Avian leukosis virus subgroup J was identified by an immunofluorescence assay with monoclonal antibody JE9, whereas Marek's disease virus or reticuloendotheliosis virus was not detected. Sequence analysis of the complete proviral genome revealed that there was 96.0-99.6% identity between each other and had a homology of 94.6-96.0% when compared with the reference strain. The six isolates formed one distinct lineage separate from the reference sequences in a phylogenetic-tree, which suggested that there were several genetic differences between these groups. Homology analysis of the env, pol, and gag genes of the six isolates showed that the env gene was more variable, especially the gp85 protein, which shared only 88.2-91.9% identity with the reference strains. Sequence comparisons of the gp85 protein indicated that 19 sites were different from those in the NX0101 and HPRS-103 strains inducing myeloid leukosis; among our strains, five mutations were identical to those in the viruses causing hemangioma. Four other distinctive mutations were detected in our six isolates. This study reminds us that the surveillance of viral eradication should be conducted continuously on a farm where ALVs were eradicated. To prevent the prevalence of ALVs, more attention should be paid to daily monitoring.","['Meng, Fanfeng', 'Li, Qiuchen', 'Zhang, Yubiao', 'Cui, Zhizhong', 'Chang, Shuang', 'Zhao, Peng']","['Meng F', 'Li Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui Z', 'Chang S', 'Zhao P']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China."", ""Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Tai'an, Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*physiology', '*Chickens', 'China', 'Female', 'Hemangioma/*veterinary/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Sequence Alignment/veterinary', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/05/23 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)30800-4 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pey121 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2018 Aug 1;97(8):2667-2674. doi: 10.3382/ps/pey121.,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, thus far the all-trans retinoic acid-based differentiation therapy has been the only successful modality in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here, we showed that vibsanin A, a novel protein kinase C (PKC) activator, sensitized AML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced differentiation. Vibsanin A augmented the ability of TKIs to induce growth inhibition and G1 cell cycle arrest of AML cells. Mechanistically, PKC activation was involved in the differentiation-inducing effects of combining vibsanin A with TKIs. Moreover, we found that vibsanin A enhanced TKI-induced Lyn expression and suppression of Lyn interfered with AML cell differentiation, indicating an essential role for Lyn expression in the combination-induced differentiation. Finally, combining vibsanin A and TKIs enhanced the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Together, this is the first study to evaluate the synergy of vibsanin A and TKIs in AML cell differentiation.

The number of power plant employees and first responders with acute radiation syndrome under follow-up by the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine decreased from 179 in 1986-1991 to 105 in 2011-2015. Cancers and leukemia (19) and cardiovascular diseases (21) were the main causes of deaths among acute radiation syndrome survivors (54) during the postaccident period. Increased radiation risks of leukemia in the Ukrainian cohort of 110,645 cleanup workers exposed to low doses are comparable to those among survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945. Additionally, an excess of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was demonstrated in the cleanup workers cohort for 26 y after the exposure. A significant excess of multiple myeloma incidence [standardized incidence rate (SIR) 1.61 %, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.21], thyroid cancer (SIR 4.18, 95% CI 3.76-4.59), female breast cancer (SIR 1.57 CI 1.40-1.73), and all cancers combined (SIR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.09) was registered. High prevalence was demonstrated for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and mental health changes. However, the reasons for the increases require further investigation. To monitor other possible late effects of radiation exposure in Chornobyl cleanup workers, analytical cohort and case-control studies need to include cardiovascular pathology, specifically types of potentially radiogenic cancers using a molecular epidemiology approach. Possible effects for further study include increased rates of thyroid, breast, and lung cancers and multiple myeloma; reduction of radiation risks of leukemia to population levels; and increased morbidity and mortality of cleanup workers from cardio- and cerebrovascular pathology.","['Bazyka, Dimitry', 'Prysyazhnyuk, Anatoly', 'Gudzenko, Natalya', 'Dyagil, Iryna', 'Belyi, David', 'Chumak, Vadim', 'Buzunov, Volodymyr']","['Bazyka D', 'Prysyazhnyuk A', 'Gudzenko N', 'Dyagil I', 'Belyi D', 'Chumak V', 'Buzunov V']","['1National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov Str., Kyiv 04050 Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, 53 Melnikov Str., Kyiv 04050 Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Acute Radiation Syndrome/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Population Surveillance', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/23 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000000868 [doi]', '00004032-201807000-00019 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2018 Jul;115(1):161-169. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000000868.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the known clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GO was withdrawn from the market in 2010 due to increased early deaths witnessed in newly diagnosed AML patients receiving GO + intensive chemotherapy. In 2017, new data on the clinical efficacy and safety of GO administered on a fractionated-dosing schedule led to re-approval for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML. Areas covered: Addition of fractionated GO to chemotherapy significantly improved event-free survival of newly diagnosed AML patients with favorable and intermediate cytogenetic-risk disease. GO monotherapy also prolonged survival in newly diagnosed unfit patients and relapse-free survival in relapsed/refractory AML. This new dosing schedule was associated with decreased incidence of hepatotoxicity, veno-occlusive disease, and early mortality. Expert commentary: GO represents the first drug-antibody conjugate approved (twice) in the United States for AML. Its re-emergence adds a valuable agent back into the armamentarium for AML. The approval of GO as well as three other agents for AML in 2017 highlights the need for rapid cytogenetic and molecular characterization of AML and incorporation into new treatment algorithms.","['Baron, Jeffrey', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Baron J', 'Wang ES']","['a Department of Pharmacy , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.', 'b Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine , Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center , Buffalo , NY , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180611,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Approval', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD33', 'antibody drug conjugate', 'fractionated dosing', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/07/22 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2018.1478725 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2018 Jun;11(6):549-559. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2018.1478725.

TIM-3 is not expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In a xenogeneic transplantation system, we showed that targeting of TIM-3 by an anti-TIM-3 cytotoxic antibody is sufficient to eradicate human AML LSCs without affecting normal human hematopoiesis.

Septal defects, including double outlet right ventricle (DORV), are among the most common CHDs that occur in 11q-. One possible mechanism underlying the CHDs and other problems in 11q- is a defect in neural crest cell function. The E26 avian leukemia 1, 5' domain (ETS-1) gene is a member of the ETS-domain transcription factor family. ETS-1 is deleted in every 11q- patient with CHDs, and gene-targeted deletion of the ETS-1 gene in C57/B6 mice causes DORV with 100 % penetrance. Normal murine cardiac development requires precisely regulated specification of the cardiac neural crest cells (cNCCs). To begin to define the role of ETS-1 in mammalian cardiac development, we have demonstrated that ETS-1 is strongly expressed in mouse cNCCs during early heart development. Sox10 is a key regulator for the neural crest cell gene regulatory network. It is also an early marker for NCCs, and its expression can facilitate the analysis of cNCC function during embryonic development. We have demonstrated that loss of ETS-1 causes decreased migrating Sox10-expressing cells in E10.5 C57/B6 mouse embryos. These results suggest a NCC migration defect in ETS-1 mutants. Our data support the hypothesis that ETS-1 is required for specification and migration of cNCCs and for regulating a cNCC-specific gene regulatory network that is required for normal cardiac development.","['Ye, Maoqing', 'Yin, Yan', 'Fukatsu, Kazumi', 'Grossfeld, Paul']","['Ye M', 'Yin Y', 'Fukatsu K', 'Grossfeld P']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Tokyo,,,,,,,,2018/05/23 06:01,2018/05/23 06:01,,,"['NBK500319 [bookaccession]', '10.1007/978-4-431-54628-3_52 [doi]']",,,,,,,"['Copyright 2016, The Author(s).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20180523,"['9784431546276', '9784431546283']",['Springer'],"['Etiology and Morphogenesis of Congenital Heart Disease: From Gene Function and', 'Cellular Interaction to Morphology']","['Nakanishi, Toshio', 'Markwald, Roger R.', 'Baldwin, H.Scott', 'Keller, Bradley B.', 'Srivastava, Deepak', 'Yamagishi, Hiroyuki']","['Nakanishi T', 'Markwald RR', 'Baldwin HS', 'Keller BB', 'Srivastava D', 'Yamagishi H']",['2018/05/23 06:01'],['20160625'],['Chapter 52']

Our objective was to determine the incidence and predictors of fractures and recovery from osteoporosis in pediatric ALL over 6 years following glucocorticoid initiation. Vertebral fractures (VF) and vertebral body reshaping were assessed on annual spine radiographs, low-trauma non-VF were recorded at regular intervals and spine bone mineral density (BMD) was captured every 6 months for 4 years and then annually. A total of 186 children with ALL were enrolled (median age 5.3 years; range, 1.3 to 17.0 years). The cumulative fracture incidence was 32.5% for VF and 23.0% for non-VF; 39.0% of children with VF were asymptomatic. No fractures occurred in the sixth year and 71.3% of incident fractures occurred in the first 2 years. Baseline VF, cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and baseline lumbar spine (LS) BMD Z-score predicted both VF and non-VF. Vertebral body reshaping following VF was incomplete or absent in 22.7% of children. Those with residual vertebral deformity following VF were older compared to those without (median age 8.0 years at baseline [interquartile range {IQR}, 5.5 to 9.4] versus 4.8 years [IQR, 3.6 to 6.2], p = 0.04) and had more severe vertebral collapse (median maximum spinal deformity index 3.5 [IQR, 1.0 to 8.0] versus 0.5 [IQR, 0.0 to 1.0], p = 0.01). VF and low LS BMD Z-score at baseline as well as glucocorticoid exposure predicted incident VF and non-VF. Nearly 25% of children had persistent vertebral deformity following VF, more frequent in older children, and in those with more severe collapse. These results suggest the need for trials addressing interventions in the first 2 years of chemotherapy, targeting older children and children with more severe vertebral collapse, because these children are at greatest risk for incident VF and subsequent residual vertebral deformity.

First, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis to identify copy number abnormalities (CNAs) in eight genes associated with B-ALL according to genetic subtype. In Ph(+) B-ALL cell lines, the frequencies of IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B, BTG1, and PAX5 deletion were significantly higher than those in Ph(-) B-ALL cell lines. The frequency of CDKN2A/2B deletion in KMT2A rearranged cell lines was significantly lower than that in non-KMT2A rearranged cell lines. These findings suggest that CNAs are correlated with genetic subtype in B-ALL cell lines. In addition, we determined that three B-other ALL cell lines had IKZF1 deletions (YCUB-5, KOPN49, and KOPN75); we therefore performed comprehensive genetic analysis of these cell lines. YCUB-5, KOPN49, and KOPN75 had P2RY8-CRLF2, IgH-CRLF2, and PAX5-ETV6 fusions, respectively. Moreover, targeted capture sequencing revealed that YCUB-5 had JAK2 R683I and KRAS G12D, and KOPN49 had JAK2 R683G and KRAS G13D mutations. These data may contribute to progress in the field of leukemia research.","['Tomoyasu, Chihiro', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Tomii, Toshihiro', 'Yano, Mio', 'Asai, Daisuke', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Takita, Junko', 'Minegishi, Masayoshi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Hosoi, Hajime']","['Tomoyasu C', 'Imamura T', 'Tomii T', 'Yano M', 'Asai D', 'Goto H', 'Shimada A', 'Sanada M', 'Iwamoto S', 'Takita J', 'Minegishi M', 'Inukai T', 'Sugita K', 'Hosoi H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Maizuru Medical Center, Maizuru, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto City Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Japanese Red Cross Kyoto Daini Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Division of Hemato-Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Fukushima Blood Center, Okuma, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yamanashi University, Kofu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yamanashi University, Kofu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180521,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line', 'BTG1', 'CDKN2A', 'CDKN2B', 'Copy number abnormality', 'IKZF1']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/11/07 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-2474-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-2474-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Sep;108(3):312-318. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-2474-7.

Materials and Methods: This study comprised 128 adult AML patients referred to the Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Research Center of Shariati Hospital. NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were detected by fragment analysis. For DNMT3A exon 23 mutation analysis, we used Sanger sequencing. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used to calculate differences between groups. Results: The prevalence of DNMT3A exon 23 mutations was 15.6% and hotspot region R882 mutations were prominent. RFS and OS were compared in patients with and without DNMT3A exon 23 mutations using univariate analysis and there was no significant difference between these groups of patients. On the contrary, the FLT3-ITD mutation significantly reduced the OS (p=0.009) and RFS (p=0.006) in AML patients after allogeneic HSCT. In the next step, patients with AML were divided into four groups regarding FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations. Patients with DNMT3A R882mut/FLT3-ITDpos had the worst OS and RFS. These results indicate that DNMT3A mutations alone do not affect the clinical outcomes of AML patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, but when accompanied by FLT3-ITD mutations, the OS was significantly reduced (5-year OS 0% for DNMT3A R882mut/FLT3-ITDpos patients vs. 62% DNMT3A R882wt/FLT3-ITDneg, p=0.025) and the relapse rate increased. Conclusion: It can be deduced that DNMT3A R882mut/FLT3-ITDpos is an unfavorable prognostic factor in AML patients even after allogeneic HSCT.","['Ardestani, Majid Teremmahi', 'Kazemi, Ahmad', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Jalili, Mahdi', 'Vaezi, Mohammad', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Ardestani MT', 'Kazemi A', 'Chahardouli B', 'Mohammadi S', 'Nikbakht M', 'Rostami S', 'Jalili M', 'Vaezi M', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Iran University of Medical Sciences, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Department of Hematology, Tehran, Iran', 'Iran University of Medical Sciences, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Department of Hematology, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran', 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Cell Therapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center; Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran, Iran']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180522,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNMT3A R882', '*FLT3-ITD', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Acute myeloid leukemia']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.2018.0017 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2018 Aug 3;35(3):158-167. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2018.0017.

It is important that patients quit smoking and remain abstinent regardless of cancer type. Some cancer types (eg, lung) have stronger links to smoking as a cause than do others (eg, colorectal). The aims of this study were to (1) assess associations between smoking-relatedness of the cancer type with beliefs and attitudes concerning smoking abstinence (eg, confidence, self-efficacy), and (2) assess these variables as predictors of future abstinence. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, cancer patients (N = 357) who quit smoking within the previous 90 days were assigned a code of 3, 2, or 1 according to the cancer type's level of smoking-relatedness: Very related (n = 134, thoracic and head and neck), Somewhat related (n = 93, acute myeloid leukemia, bladder, cervix, colorectal, esophageal, kidney, liver, pancreas, and stomach), and Unlikely related (n = 137, all other cancer types). RESULTS: Smoking-relatedness was positively associated with plan to stay smoke-free, maximum confidence in being smoke-free in 6 months, higher abstinence self-efficacy, and lower expected difficulty in staying smoke-free. Each of the 4 beliefs and attitude variables predicted abstinence 2 months later. Smoking-relatedness also predicted abstinence in a univariate model, but not in a multivariable model with the belief and attitude variables. Using backwards stepwise procedures, the final model included plan to stay smoke-free, confidence in being smoke-free, and abstinence self-efficacy.

Due to the difficulty of compliance with this treatment, CR mimetics such as resveratrol (RSV) have been considered. The present study compared the effects of RSV and CR on hypothalamic remodeling in a diet-switching experiment. METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice received high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks, subsequently their diet switched to chow diet, HFD + RSV, chow diet + RSV or CR diet for a further 6 weeks. Body weight, fat accumulation, hypothalamic apoptosis and expression of trophic factors as well as generation and fate specification of newborn cells in arcuate nucleus (ARC) were evaluated. RESULTS: Switching diet to RSV-containing foods leading to weight and fat loss after 6 weeks. In addition, not only a significant reduction in apoptosis but also a considerable increase in production of newborn cells in ARC occurred following consumption of RSV-enriched diets. These were in line with augmentation of hypothalamic ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor expression. Interestingly, RSV-containing diets changed the fate of newborn neurons toward generation of more proopiomelanocortin than neuropeptide Y neurons. The CR had effects similar to those of RSV-containing diets in the all-evaluated aspects besides neurogenesis in ARC. CONCLUSIONS: Although both RSV-containing and CR diets changed the fate of newborn neurons to create an anorexigenic architecture for ARC, newborn neurons were more available after switching to RSV-enriched diets. It can be consider as a promising mechanism for future investigations.","['Safahani, Maryam', 'Aligholi, Hadi', 'Noorbakhsh, Farshid', 'Djalali, Mahmoud', 'Pishva, Hamideh', 'Modarres Mousavi, Sayed Mostafa', 'Alizadeh, Leila', 'Gorji, Ali', 'Koohdani, Fariba']","['Safahani M', 'Aligholi H', 'Noorbakhsh F', 'Djalali M', 'Pishva H', 'Modarres Mousavi SM', 'Alizadeh L', 'Gorji A', 'Koohdani F']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Neuroscience, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Shefa Neuroscience Research Center, Khatam-al-Anbia Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Shefa Neuroscience Research Center, Khatam-al-Anbia Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Shefa Neuroscience Research Center, Khatam-al-Anbia Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Shefa Neuroscience Research Center, Khatam-al-Anbia Hospital, Tehran, Iran. gorjial@uni-muenster.de.', 'Department of Neurology, Department of Neurosurgery, Epilepsy Research Center, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Robert-Koch-Strasse 45, 48149, Munster, Germany. gorjial@uni-muenster.de.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. gorjial@uni-muenster.de.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. fkoohdan@sina.tums.ac.ir.', 'Diabetes Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. fkoohdan@sina.tums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180521,Germany,Eur J Nutr,European journal of nutrition,100888704,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus/*drug effects', 'Caloric Restriction/*methods', 'Diet, High-Fat/*adverse effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurogenesis/*drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Obesity/*diet therapy', 'Resveratrol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Calorie restriction', 'High-fat diet', 'Hypothalamus', 'Neurogenesis', 'Obesity', 'Resveratrol']",2018/05/23 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00394-018-1715-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00394-018-1715-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Nutr. 2019 Jun;58(4):1687-1701. doi: 10.1007/s00394-018-1715-0.

However, relapse after transplantation remains a major clinical problem resulting in poor prognosis. Thus, detection of measurable (""minimal"") residual disease to identify patients at high risk of relapse is essential. A feasible method to determine measurable residual disease may be digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) that allows absolute quantification with high sensitivity and specificity without the necessity of standard curves. Using ddPCR, we analyzed pre-transplant peripheral blood and bone marrow of 51 NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia patients transplanted in complete remission or complete remission with incomplete recovery. Mutated NPM1 measurable residual disease-positive patients had higher cumulative incidence of relapse (P < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (P = 0.014). Restricting the analyses to patients receiving non-myeloablative conditioning, mutated NPM1 measurable residual disease positivity is associated with higher cumulative incidence of relapse (P < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (P = 0.006). Positive mutated NPM1 measurable residual disease status determined by ddPCR before allogeneic stem cell transplantation is associated with worse prognosis independent of other known prognostic markers-also for those receiving non-myeloablative conditioning. In the future, mutated NPM1 measurable residual disease status determined by ddPCR might guide treatment and improve patients' outcomes.","['Bill, Marius', 'Grimm, Juliane', 'Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Kloss, Laura', 'Goldmann, Karoline', 'Schulz, Julia', 'Beinicke, Stefanie', 'Hantschel, Janine', 'Cross, Michael', 'Vucinic, Vladan', 'Ponisch, Wolfram', 'Behre, Gerhard', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Schwind, Sebastian']","['Bill M', 'Grimm J', 'Jentzsch M', 'Kloss L', 'Goldmann K', 'Schulz J', 'Beinicke S', 'Hantschel J', 'Cross M', 'Vucinic V', 'Ponisch W', 'Behre G', 'Franke GN', 'Lange T', 'Niederwieser D', 'Schwind S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, University of Leipzig, Jose-Carreras-research building, Johannisallee 32A, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a second primary malignancy is rarely described in the literature. Herein, we describe two patients with MM treated with induction therapy, ASCT, and lenalidomide maintenance that experienced cytopenias while on maintenance. ALL was unexpectedly diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy. One patient was diagnosed on routine biopsy performed as part of requirements of the clinical trial. Both patients had B-cell ALL, without known poor risk cytogenetics, and were managed with standard induction therapies resulting in complete remission. We also reviewed the literature for similar cases of secondary ALL (sALL) in MM patients exposed to immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). In conclusion, persistent cytopenias in responding MM patients receiving IMiDs maintenance should be an indication for bone marrow biopsy. Patients develop sALL after median of 32.5 months (range, 20-84) from being on lenalidomide or thalidomide maintenance, often presenting with cytopenias, display low tolerance to chemotherapy, but remission can often be achieved.","['Khan, Abdullah M', 'Muzaffar, Jameel', 'Murthy, Hermant', 'Wingard, John R', 'Moreb, Jan S']","['Khan AM', 'Muzaffar J', 'Murthy H', 'Wingard JR', 'Moreb JS']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180212,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,2018/05/23 06:00,2018/05/23 06:01,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/9052314 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2018 Feb 12;2018:9052314. doi: 10.1155/2018/9052314. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5896379,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9330-7500'],,,,,,['Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Aug 4;2019:1548610.

Andrographolide, a compound extracted from Andrographis paniculata, was recently proven to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and can induce apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible synergism between TP and andrographolide in acute myeloid cells in vitro. Materials and methods: U937 acute myeloid leukemic cells were cultured using Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium and then treated for 24 h with TP and andrographolide prepared through the dilution of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stocks with RPMI on the day of treatment. Cell proliferation was assessed using cell proliferation assay upon treatment with both compounds separately and in combination. Cell-cycle study and apoptosis detection were performed by staining the cells with propidium iodide (PI) stain and Annexin V/PI stain, respectively, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of various proteins involved in apoptotic pathways. Results: Both TP and andrographolide showed an antiproliferative effect in a dose-dependent manner when applied on U937 cells separately; however, pretreating the cells with andrographolide before applying TP exhibited a synergistic effect with lower inhibitory concentrations (half-maximal inhibitory concentration). Treating the cells with TP alone led to specific cell-cycle arrest at S phase that was more prominent upon pretreatment combination with andrographolide. Using Annexin V/PI staining to assess the proapoptotic effect following the pretreatment combination showed an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, which was supported by the Western blot results that manifested an upregulation of several proapoptotic proteins expression. Conclusion: The pretreatment of U937 with andrographolide followed by low doses of TP showed an enhancement in inducing apoptosis when compared to the application of each compound separately.","['Hodroj, Mohammad Hassan', 'Jardaly, Achraf', 'Abi Raad, Sarah', 'Zouein, Annalise', 'Rizk, Sandra']","['Hodroj MH', 'Jardaly A', 'Abi Raad S', 'Zouein A', 'Rizk S']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180510,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Andrographis paniculata', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'andrographolide', 'apoptosis', 'topotecan']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/05/23 06:01,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S160924 [doi]', 'cmar-10-1079 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 May 10;10:1079-1088. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S160924. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5955015,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In biomedical applications, one frequently applies cluster analysis in order to identify biologically interesting subgroups. In particular, one may wish to identify subgroups that are associated with a particular outcome of interest. Conventional clustering methods generally do not identify such subgroups, particularly when there are a large number of high-variance features in the data set. Conventional methods may identify clusters associated with these high-variance features when one wishes to obtain secondary clusters that are more interesting biologically or more strongly associated with a particular outcome of interest. A modification of sparse clustering can be used to identify such secondary clusters or clusters associated with an outcome of interest. This method correctly identifies such clusters of interest in several simulation scenarios. The method is also applied to a large prospective cohort study of temporomandibular disorders and a leukemia microarray data set.","['Gaynor, Sheila', 'Bair, Eric']","['Gaynor S', 'Bair E']","['Department of Biostatistics, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Endodontics and Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170623,Netherlands,Comput Stat Data Anal,Computational statistics & data analysis,100960938,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Cluster analysis', 'High-dimensional data', 'K-means clustering', 'Temporomandibular disorders']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/05/23 06:01,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.csda.2017.06.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Comput Stat Data Anal. 2017 Dec;116:139-154. doi: 10.1016/j.csda.2017.06.003.

Here, we analyze the reference epigenome of seven primary CLLs and the regulatory chromatin landscape of 107 primary cases in the context of normal B cell differentiation. We identify that the CLL chromatin landscape is largely influenced by distinct dynamics during normal B cell maturation. Beyond this, we define extensive catalogues of regulatory elements de novo reprogrammed in CLL as a whole and in its major clinico-biological subtypes classified by IGHV somatic hypermutation levels. We uncover that IGHV-unmutated CLLs harbor more active and open chromatin than IGHV-mutated cases. Furthermore, we show that de novo active regions in CLL are enriched for NFAT, FOX and TCF/LEF transcription factor family binding sites. Although most genetic alterations are not associated with consistent epigenetic profiles, CLLs with MYD88 mutations and trisomy 12 show distinct chromatin configurations. Furthermore, we observe that non-coding mutations in IGHV-mutated CLLs are enriched in H3K27ac-associated regulatory elements outside accessible chromatin. Overall, this study provides an integrative portrait of the CLL epigenome, identifies extensive networks of altered regulatory elements and sheds light on the relationship between the genetic and epigenetic architecture of the disease.","['Beekman, Renee', 'Chapaprieta, Vicente', 'Russinol, Nuria', 'Vilarrasa-Blasi, Roser', 'Verdaguer-Dot, Nuria', 'Martens, Joost H A', 'Duran-Ferrer, Marti',

ALL evolves in two discrete steps. First, in utero initiation by fusion gene formation or hyperdiploidy generates a covert, pre-leukaemic clone. Second, in a small fraction of these cases, the postnatal acquisition of secondary genetic changes (primarily V(D)J recombination-activating protein (RAG) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-driven copy number alterations in the case of ETS translocation variant 6 (ETV6)-runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1)(+) ALL) drives conversion to overt leukaemia. Epidemiological and modelling studies endorse a dual role for common infections. Microbial exposures earlier in life are protective but, in their absence, later infections trigger the critical secondary mutations. Risk is further modified by inherited genetics, chance and, probably, diet. Childhood ALL can be viewed as a paradoxical consequence of progress in modern societies, where behavioural changes have restrained early microbial exposure. This engenders an evolutionary mismatch between historical adaptations of the immune system and contemporary lifestyles. Childhood ALL may be a preventable cancer.","['Greaves, Mel']",['Greaves M'],"['Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. mel.greaves@icr.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

A post hoc analysis of the phase 3 FIRST trial was conducted to characterize treatment-emergent (TE) infections and study risk factors for TE grade >/= 3 infection. The number of TE infections/month was highest during the first 4 months of treatment (defined as early infection). Of 1613 treated patients, 340 (21.1%) experienced TE grade >/= 3 infections in the first 18 months and 56.2% of these patients experienced their first grade >/= 3 infection in the first 4 months. Risk of early infection was similar regardless of treatment. Based on the analyses of data in 1378 patients through multivariate logistic regression, a predictive model of first TE grade >/= 3 infection in the first 4 months retained Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and serum beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, and hemoglobin levels to define high- and low-risk groups showing significantly different rates of infection (24.0% vs. 7.0%, respectively; P < 0.0001). The predictive model was validated with data from three clinical trials. This predictive model of early TE grade >/= 3 infection may be applied in the clinical setting to guide infection monitoring and strategies for infection prevention.","['Dumontet, Charles', 'Hulin, Cyrille', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A', 'Belch, Andrew', 'Dispenzieri, Angela', 'Ludwig, Heinz', 'Rodon, Philippe', 'Van Droogenbroeck, Jan', 'Qiu, Lugui', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Van de Velde, Ann', 'Lahuerta, Juan Jose', 'Allangba, Olivier', 'Lee, Jae Hoon', 'Boyle, Eileen', 'Perrot, Aurore', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Manier, Salomon', 'Attal, Michel', 'Roussel, Murielle', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Mary, Jean Yves', 'Civet, Alexandre', 'Costa, Bruno', 'Tinel, Antoine', 'Gaston-Mathe, Yann', 'Facon, Thierry']","['Dumontet C', 'Hulin C', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Belch A', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Ludwig H', 'Rodon P', 'Van Droogenbroeck J', 'Qiu L', 'Cavo M', 'Van de Velde A', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Allangba O', 'Lee JH', 'Boyle E', 'Perrot A', 'Moreau P', 'Manier S', 'Attal M', 'Roussel M', 'Mohty M', 'Mary JY', 'Civet A', 'Costa B', 'Tinel A', 'Gaston-Mathe Y', 'Facon T']","['Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Wilhelminen Hospital, Wilhelminen Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.', 'Centre Hospitalier, Perigueux, France.', 'AZ Sint-Jan AV Brugge, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Seragnoli Institute of Hematology, Bologna University School of Medicine, Bologna, Italy.', 'Universitair Ziekenhuis Antwerpen, Edegem, Belgium.', 'Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centre Hospitalier Yves Le Foll, Saint-Brieuc, France.', 'Gachon University Gil Hospital, Incheon, Korea.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, France.', 'CHU de Nancy, Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France.', 'University of Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, France.', 'Hopitaux de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'CHU Purpan/IUCT Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1153, University Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Quinten, Paris, France.', 'Celgene International Sarl, Boudry, Switzerland.', 'Celgene International Sarl, Boudry, Switzerland.', 'YGM Consult, Paris, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, France. thierry.facon@chru-lille.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180426,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,,2018/05/23 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0133-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0133-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jun;32(6):1404-1413. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0133-x.

MUC1 has been considered a possible therapeutic target for the past 30 years as it is up-regulated, aberrantly glycosylated and its polarization is lost in many adenocarcinomas. Moreover, MUC1 is expressed by some haematopoietic cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloma. Although multiple clinical trials have been initiated and immune responses have been documented, effective clinical benefit worthy of approval for general application has not as yet been achieved. However, this does not appear to have quelled the interest in MUC1 as a therapeutic target, as shown by the increase in the number of MUC1-based clinical trials initiated in 2017 ( Figure 1). As with all translational studies, incorporating new relevant research findings into therapeutic strategy is difficult. Decisions are made to commit to a specific strategy based on the information and data available when the trial is initiated. However, the time required for preclinical studies and early trials can render the founding concept not always appropriate for proceeding to a larger definitive trial. Here, we summarize the attempts made, to date, to bring MUC1 into the world of cancer immunotherapy and discuss how research findings regarding MUC1 structure and function together with expanded knowledge of its interactions with the tumour environment and immune effector cells could lead to improved therapeutic approaches. ppbiost;46/3/659/BST20170400CF1F1BST-2017-0400CF1Figure 1.Number of MUC1-targeted trials initiated each year.","['Taylor-Papadimitriou, Joyce', 'Burchell, Joy M', 'Graham, Rosalind', 'Beatson, Richard']","['Taylor-Papadimitriou J', 'Burchell JM', 'Graham R', 'Beatson R']","[""Breast Cancer Biology Lab, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, U.K. joyce.taylor-papadimitriou@kcl.ac.uk."", ""Breast Cancer Biology Lab, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, U.K."", ""Breast Cancer Biology Lab, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, U.K."", ""Breast Cancer Biology Lab, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180521,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Mucin-1/chemistry/*immunology/physiology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MUC1', '*cancer', '*immunotherapy']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2017/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['BST20170400 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20170400 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2018 Jun 19;46(3):659-668. doi: 10.1042/BST20170400.

Current treatment options for FLT3(ITD)-positive AMLs include genotoxic therapy and FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i's), which are rarely curative. PARP1 inhibitors (PARP1i's) have been successfully applied to induce synthetic lethality in tumors harboring BRCA1/2 mutations and displaying homologous recombination (HR) deficiency. We show here that inhibition of FLT3(ITD) activity by the FLT3i AC220 caused downregulation of DNA repair proteins BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51, and LIG4, resulting in inhibition of 2 major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, HR, and nonhomologous end-joining. PARP1i, olaparib, and BMN673 caused accumulation of lethal DSBs and cell death in AC220-treated FLT3(ITD)-positive leukemia cells, thus mimicking synthetic lethality. Moreover, the combination of FLT3i and PARP1i eliminated FLT3(ITD)-positive quiescent and proliferating leukemia stem cells, as well as leukemic progenitors, from human and mouse leukemia samples. Notably, the combination of AC220 and BMN673 significantly delayed disease onset and effectively reduced leukemia-initiating cells in an FLT3(ITD)-positive primary AML xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, we postulate that FLT3i-induced deficiencies in DSB repair pathways sensitize FLT3(ITD)-positive AML cells to synthetic lethality triggered by PARP1i's. Therefore, FLT3(ITD) could be used as a precision medicine marker for identifying AML patients that may benefit from a therapeutic regimen combining FLT3 and PARP1i's.","['Maifrede, Silvia', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Sullivan-Reed, Katherine', 'Dasgupta, Yashodhara', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Le, Bac Viet', 'Solecka, Martyna', 'Lian, Zhaorui', 'Belyaeva, Elizaveta A', 'Nersesyan, Alina', 'Machnicki, Marcin M', 'Toma, Monika', 'Chatain, Nicolas', 'Rydzanicz, Malgorzata', 'Zhao, Huaqing', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Ploski, Rafal', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Sykes, Stephen M', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Valent, Peter', 'Wasik, Mariusz A', 'Huang, Jian', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Maifrede S', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Sullivan-Reed K', 'Dasgupta Y', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Le BV', 'Solecka M', 'Lian Z', 'Belyaeva EA', 'Nersesyan A', 'Machnicki MM', 'Toma M', 'Chatain N', 'Rydzanicz M', 'Zhao H', 'Jelinek J', 'Piwocka K', 'Sliwinski T', 'Stoklosa T', 'Ploski R', 'Fischer T', 'Sykes SM', 'Koschmieder S', 'Bullinger L', 'Valent P', 'Wasik MA', 'Huang J', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Immunology, The Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, The Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Center of Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Research Institute of Fox Chase Cancer Center, Immune Cell Development and Host Defense, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Charite-University Medicine, Berlin, Germany;

Results showed that 30% PSP-PN aggregate significantly reduced beta-hexosaminidase and histamine levels by 54.2% and 49.2%, respectively compared with control. Immunoblotting results revealed 40% PSP-PN aggregates significantly decreased IgE binding by 19%. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was significantly reduced while phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK increased upon PSP-PN protein aggregate exposure to the cells. Our results show that aggregation of PSP to PN proteins reduces allergic response by inhibiting Ca(2+)-induced MAPK-dependent cell degranulation.","['Bansode, Rishipal R', 'Plundrich, Nathalie J', 'Randolph, Priscilla D', 'Lila, Mary Ann', 'Williams, Leonard L']","['Bansode RR', 'Plundrich NJ', 'Randolph PD', 'Lila MA', 'Williams LL']","['Center for Excellence in Post-Harvest Technologies, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina 28081, USA.', 'Plants for Human Health Institute, Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, North Carolina State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina 28081, USA.', 'Center for Excellence in Post-Harvest Technologies, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina 28081, USA.', 'Plants for Human Health Institute, Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, North Carolina State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina 28081, USA.', 'Center for Excellence in Post-Harvest Technologies, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina 28081, USA.

Documentation of fertility-related discussions and actions is crucial to providing the best follow-up care, which may occur for many years post-treatment. This study examined the rate of medical record documentation of fertility-related discussions and fertility preservation (FP) procedures for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer in Australia. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records for 941 patients in all six Australian states. Patients were identified through population-based cancer registries (four states) and hospital admission lists (two states). Trained data collectors extracted information from medical records using a comprehensive data collection survey. Records were reviewed for AYA patients (aged 15-24yearsat diagnosis), diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, central nervous system (CNS) tumours, soft tissue sarcomas (STS), primary bone cancer or Ewing's family tumours between 2007 and 2012. RESULTS: 47.2% of patients had a documented fertility discussion and 35.9% had a documented FP procedure. Fertility-related documentation was less likely for female patients, those with a CNS or STS diagnosis and those receiving high-risk treatments. In multivariable models, adult hospitals with an AYA focus were more likely to document fertility discussions (odds ratio[OR]=1.60; 95%CI=1.08-2.37) and FP procedures (OR=1.74; 95%CI=1.17-2.57) than adult hospitals with no AYA services. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first national, population-based estimates of fertility documentation for AYA cancer patients in Australia. Documentation of fertility-related discussions was poor, with higher rates observed in hospitals with greater experience of treating AYA patients.","['Skaczkowski, G', 'White, V', 'Thompson, K', 'Bibby, H', 'Coory, M', 'Pinkerton, R', 'Nicholls, W', 'Orme, L M', 'Conyers, R', 'Phillips, M B', 'Osborn, M', 'Harrup, R', 'Anazodo, A']","['Skaczkowski G', 'White V', 'Thompson K', 'Bibby H', 'Coory M', 'Pinkerton R', 'Nicholls W', 'Orme LM', 'Conyers R', 'Phillips MB', 'Osborn M', 'Harrup R', 'Anazodo A']","['Center for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Council Victoria, 615 St Kilda Road, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia; School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora Campus, Bundoora, 3086 VIC, Australia; Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Center, Austin Health, Level 4, 145 Studley Road, Heidelberg, 3084 VIC, Australia.', 'Center for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Council Victoria, 615 St Kilda Road, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia; School of Psychology, Deakin University, Melbourne Burwood Campus, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, VIC 3125, Australia.

Here we show that low levels of the p53 protein enhance the capacity of leukemic stem cells from FA patients to repopulate immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, boosting p53 protein levels with the use of the small molecule Nutlin-3 reduced leukemia burden in recipient mice.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical implication of miR-200s clusters in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: RT-qPCR was performed to detect expression of miR-200s clusters in 19 healthy donors, 98 newly diagnosed AML patients, and 35 AML patients achieved complete remission (CR). RESULTS: Expression of miR-200a/200b/429 cluster but not miR-200c/141 cluster was decreased in newly diagnosed AML patients as compared to healthy donors and AML patients achieved CR. Although no significant differences were observed between miR-200s clusters and most of the features, low expression of miR-200s clusters seems to be associated with higher white blood cells especially for miR-200a/200b. Of the five members of miR-200s clusters, low expression of miR-200b/429/200c was found to be associated with lower CR rate. Logistic regression analysis further revealed that low expression of miR-429 acted as an independent risk factor for CR in AML. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, low expression of miR-200b/429/200c was associated with shorter OS, whereas miR-200a/141 had a trend. Moreover, multivariate analysis of Cox regression models confirmed the independently prognostic value of miR-200b expression for OS in AML. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of miR-200a/200b/429 cluster was frequently down-regulated in AML, and low expression of miR-429 as an independent risk factor for CR, whereas low expression of miR-200b as an independent prognostic biomarker for OS.","['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Liu-Chao', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Gu, Yu', 'Wu, De-Hong', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Guo, Hong', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Zhang LC', 'Zhang TJ', 'Gu Y', 'Wu DH', 'Zhang W', 'Ma JC', 'Wen XM', 'Guo H', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Jingjiang College of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third People's Hospital of Kunshan City, Kunshan, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. linjiangmail@sina.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. linjiangmail@sina.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. qianjun0007@hotmail.com."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. qianjun0007@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180521,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Expression', '*Prognosis', '*miR-200']",2018/05/23 06:00,2019/06/15 06:00,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-018-1494-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-018-1494-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2018 May 21;16(1):135. doi: 10.1186/s12967-018-1494-7.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN200 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,PMC5963159,,,"['81270630/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', 'CXTDB2017002/Medical Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province/International', 'BRA2016131/333 Project of Jiangsu Province/International', '2015-WSN-115/Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province/International', 'KYCX17_1821/Postgraduate Research &amp;

This paper proposes a novel therapeutic agent for pediatric ALL on the basis of a failed clinical drug trial in 2006. TGN1412 was a promising therapeutic agent that yielded outstanding results in both in vitro studies and animal trials. It is a CD28 superagonist monoclonal antibody that activates T regulatory (TReg) cells in the absence of costimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by an antigen-presenting cell. This drug was intended as a solution to T cell deficient diseases such as B cell leukemia and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. When phase I clinical trials were conducted, all volunteers that received the drug experienced severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and faced multiple-organ failure within hours. TGN1412 was reassessed and re-entered clinical trials as a therapeutic for rheumatoid arthritis. A new assay was developed to better quantify T cell response, and volunteers in this trial experienced no pro-inflammatory cytokine release. This essay analyzes how misinformation contributed to the failure of TGN1412 in clinical trials and how revisiting this therapeutic could yield a novel treatment for pediatric B cell leukemia.","['Brown, Katelyn E']",['Brown KE'],"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. kbrown10@rams.colostate.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180519,Switzerland,Diseases,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",101636232,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell leukemia', 'clinical trials', 'pediatric therapeutics']",2018/05/23 06:00,2018/05/23 06:01,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['diseases6020041 [pii]', '10.3390/diseases6020041 [doi]']",epublish,Diseases. 2018 May 19;6(2). pii: diseases6020041. doi: 10.3390/diseases6020041.,,,PMC6023298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether there is synergism between the two viruses in viral replication and pathogenicity has remained elusive. In this study, we found that the superinfection of MDV and ALV-J increased the viral replication of the two viruses in RNA and protein level, and synergistically promoted the expression of IL-10, IL-6, and TGF-beta in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Moreover, MDV and ALV-J protein expression in dual-infected cells detected by confocal laser scanning microscope appeared earlier in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and caused more severe cytopathy than single infection, suggesting that synergistically increased MDV and ALV-J viral-protein biosynthesis is responsible for the severe cytopathy. In vivo, compared to the single virus infected chickens, the mortality and tumor formation rates increased significantly in MDV and ALV-J dual-infected chickens.

His team of researchers used a fledgling PCR-based re-sequencing pipeline to target and sequence various suspect/candidate genes in AML. However, this search for new genes that are frequently mutated in AML proved to be largely unsuccessful and led to the notion of whole-genome re-sequencing (e.g., that of an unbiased look at all genes and structural changes). Therefore, the sequencing of this interviewee's genome followed the researchers' first AML genome case, published in Nature on 6 November 2008 [1] , and since the first patient that they sequenced was a female (now deceased of her disease), they decided to choose a male patient in remission from the disease but with the same AML subtype (M1). Hence, AML2 was sequenced and analyzed - they identified recurring mutations that may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease. They subsequently published their results in the New England Journal of Medicine on 10 September 2009 [2] . The ultimate goal of their research is to change the 'standard of care' for AML patients, since for the last 25 years, doctors have been treating every AML patient in basically the same way, never knowing who will respond and go into remission, or who will not respond and will need a bone marrow transplant.",,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Per Med,Personalized medicine,101238549,,,,,2009/11/01 00:00,2009/11/01 00:01,['2018/05/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/pme.09.56 [doi]'],ppublish,Per Med. 2009 Nov;6(6):621-622. doi: 10.2217/pme.09.56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we studied the cytotoxic effects of silibinin combined with sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results indicated that silibinin combined with sorafenib potently inhibited the proliferation of various HCC cells and induced significant apoptosis. In an HCC subcutaneous transplantation tumor model, the combination of silibinin and sorafenib significantly suppressed tumor growth compared with monotherapy. As determined by fluorescence staining and Western blots, the combination of the two drugs inhibited the phosphorylation of RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) together with the expression of antiapoptotic proteins including myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (Mcl-1) and apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (Bcl-2), resulting in the death of cancer cells. We also found that the combination inhibited the formation and self-renewal of HCC stem cells by down-regulating the expression of stemness-related proteins, such as Homeobox protein NANOG (Nanog) and Krueppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). These results suggested that silibinin improved the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC therapy, indicating a clinical promising therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.","['Mao, Jie', 'Yang, Hongbao', 'Cui, Tingting', 'Pan, Pan', 'Kabir, Nadia', 'Chen, Duo', 'Ma, Jinyan', 'Chen, Xingyi', 'Chen, Yijun', 'Yang, Yong']","['Mao J', 'Yang H', 'Cui T', 'Pan P', 'Kabir N', 'Chen D', 'Ma J', 'Chen X', 'Chen Y', 'Yang Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China; Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'New Drug Safety Evaluation and Research, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Translational Medicine lab, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.

This information is clinically relevant, as initiating lesions that lead to cell transformation and leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) activity are promising therapeutic targets against the major hurdle of T-ALL relapse. Here, we describe the generation in vivo of a human T cell leukemia that recapitulates T-ALL in patients, which arises de novo in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic progenitors ectopically expressing active NOTCH1. This T-ALL model allowed us to identify CD44 as a direct NOTCH1 transcriptional target and to recognize CD44 overexpression as an early hallmark of preleukemic cells that engraft the BM and finally develop a clonal transplantable T-ALL that infiltrates lymphoid organs and brain. Notably, CD44 is shown to support crucial BM niche interactions necessary for LIC activity of human T-ALL xenografts and disease progression, highlighting the importance of the NOTCH1/CD44 axis in T-ALL pathogenesis. The observed therapeutic benefit of anti-CD44 antibody administration in xenotransplanted mice holds great promise for therapeutic purposes against T-ALL relapse.","['Garcia-Peydro, Marina', 'Fuentes, Patricia', 'Mosquera, Marta', 'Garcia-Leon, Maria J', 'Alcain, Juan', 'Rodriguez, Antonio', 'Garcia de Miguel, Purificacion', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Weijer, Kees', 'Spits, Hergen', 'Scadden, David T', 'Cuesta-Mateos, Carlos', 'Munoz-Calleja, Cecilia', 'Sanchez-Madrid, Francisco', 'Toribio, Maria L']","['Garcia-Peydro M', 'Fuentes P', 'Mosquera M', 'Garcia-Leon MJ', 'Alcain J', 'Rodriguez A', 'Garcia de Miguel P', 'Menendez P', 'Weijer K', 'Spits H', 'Scadden DT', 'Cuesta-Mateos C', 'Munoz-Calleja C', 'Sanchez-Madrid F', 'Toribio ML']","['Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, and.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, and.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, and.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, and.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, and.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hemato-Oncology and Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBER-ONC), Barcelona, ISCIII, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Academic Medical Center, and.', 'Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal Research, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Harvard University Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, UAM, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, UAM, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, UAM, IIS-IP, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Vascular Biology and In fl ammation, Fundacion Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares-Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180521,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology', '*T cell development']",2018/05/22 06:00,2019/09/17 06:00,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['92981 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI92981 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Jul 2;128(7):2802-2818. doi: 10.1172/JCI92981.

Prior to performing cancer reprogramming studies, it is important to evaluate the stemness predisposition of cells that will be reprogrammed. We performed a proof-of-concept study with chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells in order to evaluate their tendency for cancer cell reprogramming. Materials and Methods: Expression of reprogramming factors, pluripotency markers, and tumor-suppressor genes was analyzed at gene and protein levels via real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used as a positive control. Results: K562 cells were shown to express higher levels of most of the reprogramming factors and pluripotency markers. Expression of p53, which is one of the main regulators during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, was found to be lower in K562 cells compared to PBMCs, whereas the other tumor-suppressor genes showed higher expression levels. Conclusion: This study suggested that, similar to healthy human PBMCs, K526 cells could be used in cancer cell reprogramming studies. Generating induced pluripotent stem cells from leukemia cells could help scientists to establish chronic myeloid leukemia models in vitro for a better understanding of therapy resistance and development of novel therapeutic targets.","['Yilmazer Aktuna, Acelya']",['Yilmazer Aktuna A'],"['Ankara University Faculty of Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180521,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Induced pluripotent stem cells', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*K562', '*Disease modeling', '*Cell reprogramming']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.2018.0106 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2018 Nov 13;35(4):260-264. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2018.0106.

We investigated associations between neutrophil recovery time after the first induction course, infection and relapse in children treated according to NOPHO-AML 2004 and DB AML-01. PROCEDURE: Newly diagnosed patients with AML with bone marrow blast <5% between day 15 after the start of the treatment and the start of second induction course, and in complete remission after the second induction course were included (n = 279). Neutrophil recovery time was defined as the time from the start of the course to the last day with absolute neutrophil count <0.5 x 10(9) /l. Linear and Cox regressions were used to investigate associations. RESULTS: Neutrophil recovery time after the first induction course was positively associated with neutrophil recovery time after the remaining courses, and longer neutrophil recovery time (>/=25 days) was associated with increased risk of grade 3-4 infections (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8). Longer neutrophil recovery time after the first induction (>30 days) was associated with the increased risk of relapse (5-year cumulative incidence: 48% vs. 42%, hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) for cases not treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission. CONCLUSION: Longer neutrophil recovery time after the first induction course was associated with grade 3-4 infections and relapse.

Methods MiRNA and gene expression data, as well as clinical data of 176 patients were first downloaded from TCGA. Then miRNAs and genes significantly affecting the survival time based on KM survival curve were identified using Log Rank test. Next, COX proportional-hazard regression analysis was performed to screen the risk miRNAs (P-value < 0.05). Common genes from survival analysis and predicted by miRWalk were used to construct the miRNA regulatory network with the risk miRNAs. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, as well as functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis. Results The survival analysis revealed 33 miRNAs and 1,377 genes significantly affecting the survival time. HR values of nine miRNAs (up-regulated hsa-mir-606, 520a, 137, 362, 599, 600, 202, 639and down-regulated 502) were either >1 or <1. The miRNA regulatory network contained 477 nodes and 944 edges. The top ten genes of the constructed PPI network were EGFR, EIF4G1, REL, TOP1, COL14A1, HDAC3, MRPL49, PSMA2, TOP2A and VCAM1 successively. According to pathway enrichment analysis, 6 KEGG pathways and 6 REACTOME pathways were obtained respectively. Conclusion Up-regulated hsa-mir-520a, 599, 606, 137 and 362 may increase the prognostic risk for AML patients via regulating the expression of corresponding target genes, especially COL14A1, HDAC3, REL, EGFR, PSMA2, EIF4G1, MRPL49 and TOP1.","['Gao, Hai-Yan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Luo, Xin-Guo', 'Jiang, Yong-Fang', 'He, Xin', 'Xu, Ping', 'Chen, Xi', 'Li, Xiao-Yun']","['Gao HY', 'Wang W', 'Luo XG', 'Jiang YF', 'He X', 'Xu P', 'Chen X', 'Li XY']","[""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""b Department of Hematology , Jinhua People's Hospital , Jinhua , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180519,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', '*MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'MicroRNA', 'expression regulation', 'prognostic risk']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1475860 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):747-755. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1475860.

The role that RabGTPases might play in some hallmarks of cancer represents interesting areas of study since these proteins are frequently altered in cancer. However, their participation is not well known. Recently, Rab35was recognized as an oncogenic RabGTPase and and because of its association with different cellular functions, distinctly important in immune cells, a possible role of Rab35 in leukemia can be suggested. Nevertheless, the involvement of Rab35 in cancer remains poorly understood and its possible specific role in leukemia remains unknown.

Many small module inhibitors targeting kinases within the BCR pathway are approved, with others in development, offering alternative treatment options to standard chemoimmunotherapy. Areas covered: This review covers both approved inhibitors and investigational inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. To collect relevant articles, a literature search was completed through the use of PubMed and abstracts from ASH and ASCO national meetings. Search terms including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and BCR inhibitors, as well as the individual drug names, were utilized. The majority of included studies are dated from 2012 to March 2018. Expert opinion: BCR pathway inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and idelalisib, are novel treatments for non-Hodgkin lymphomas. While providing alternative treatment options to those with high-risk disease, poor functional status, and relapsed disease, outside of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), they have been limited to the relapsed/refractory setting. Their mechanisms of action, off/on-target effects, and resistance patterns create unique therapeutic dilemmas. It is our opinion that more specific inhibitors, as well as combination therapy, will define the future for BCR inhibitors.","['Rodgers, Thomas D', 'Reagan, Patrick M']","['Rodgers TD', 'Reagan PM']","['a James P.

We hypothesized that variable hormonal exposure may have a sexually dimorphic influence on treatment-free survival (TFS). In 156 CLL cases, we quantitatively profiled 29 circulating steroids (progesterone, adrenal precursors, androgens, estrogens, and catechol estrogens) as well as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone. Median TFS was shorter for men than that for women (80.7 vs. 135.0 months, P = 0.033). Circulating hormone profiles in CLL patients were significantly different from those of healthy donors. In male CLL cases, higher LH levels were associated with shorter TFS (adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj) 2.11; P = 0.004). In female CLL cases, high levels of the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and the sum of methoxy estrogens were associated with an improved TFS with HRadj values of 0.24 (P = 0.007), 0.54 (P = 0.023), and 0.31 (P = 0.034), respectively. Reduced TFS was observed for women with CLL exhibiting high expression of the steroid-inactivating UGT2B17 enzyme. This study is the first to establish a link between the outcome of CLL patients, sex steroids, and pituitary hormones, revealing a sex-specific hormonal imbalance associated with disease progression.","['Allain, Eric P', 'Venzl, Karin', 'Caron, Patrick', 'Turcotte, Veronique', 'Simonyan, David', 'Gruber, Michaela', 'Le, Trang', 'Levesque, Eric', 'Guillemette, Chantal', 'Vanura, Katrina']","['Allain EP', 'Venzl K', 'Caron P', 'Turcotte V', 'Simonyan D', 'Gruber M', 'Le T', 'Levesque E', 'Guillemette C', 'Vanura K']","['Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy, Laval University, R4701.5, 2705 Blvd. Laurier, Quebec, G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy, Laval University, R4701.5, 2705 Blvd. Laurier, Quebec, G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy, Laval University, R4701.5, 2705 Blvd. Laurier, Quebec, G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Statistical and Clinical Research Platform, CHU de Quebec Research Center, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'CHU de Quebec Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, Quebec, Canada.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center and Faculty of Pharmacy, Laval University, R4701.5, 2705 Blvd. Laurier, Quebec, G1V 4G2, Canada. chantal.guillemette@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca.', 'Canada Research Chair in Pharmacogenomics, Quebec, Canada. chantal.guillemette@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090, Vienna, Austria. katrina.vanura@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180521,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pituitary Hormones/*blood', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testosterone/blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Hormones', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Steroids', 'Treatment-free survival']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/08/29 06:00,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3356-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3356-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Sep;97(9):1649-1661. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3356-z.

Methods: Case series and review of literature. Result: Two young patients (one male and one female) with CML on treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatanib) under remission presented with bilateral sudden vision loss. One patient had bilateral multiple pockets of serous retinal fluid while the other had panuveitis with exudative retinal detachment. There was neither prodromal symptoms nor systemic signs and symptoms suggestive of VKH in both cases. They responded well to systemic steroid therapy without recurrences with complete visual recovery. Conclusion and importance: CML patients can have features similar to VKH even during stable hematological phase and may be possibly associated with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Hence it is important not to misdiagnose and treat such patients with long term immunomodulators.","['Mistry, Saurabh', 'Sudharshan, S', 'Ganesan, Suganeswari', 'Akbar, Ashraf Banu', 'Biswas, Jyotirmay']","['Mistry S', 'Sudharshan S', 'Ganesan S', 'Akbar AB', 'Biswas J']","['Sankara Nethralaya, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, India.', 'Sankara Nethralaya, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, India.', 'Sankara Nethralaya, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, India.', 'Sankara Nethralaya, Vision Research Foundation, Chennai, India.', 'Sankara Nethralaya, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180310,United States,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,101679941,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Imatinib', 'Panuveitis', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/05/22 06:01,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2017/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajoc.2018.03.010 [doi]', 'S2451-9936(17)30350-X [pii]']",epublish,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep. 2018 Mar 10;10:221-225. doi: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2018.03.010. eCollection 2018 Jun.,,,PMC5956718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have changed a fatal disease into manageable disease, most patients cannot discontinue TKI treatment due to persistence of TKI-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Much effort has been made to find out factors or pathways specifically operating in LSCs to selectively target LSCs, with some promising results at least in preclinical models. In this article, we briefly review the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and its related factors in CML LSCs, especially focusing on Tcf1/Lef1 transcription factors, major effectors of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, of which transcriptional program have recently been shown to be targetable with prostaglandin E1.","['Masamoto, Yosuke', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Masamoto Y', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180424,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', 'leukemia stem cells (LSCs)', 'prostaglandin E1', 'transcriptional program']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/05/22 06:01,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/sci.2018.03.05 [doi]', 'sci-05-2018.03.05 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2018 Apr 24;5:10. doi: 10.21037/sci.2018.03.05. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5945907,,,,,"['Conflicts of Interest: M Kurokawa received the followings: research funding from', 'Pfizer, Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb; lecture honoraria from Bristol-Myers', 'Squibb.

Chronic insufficient dietary supply is responsible for vascular fragility and impaired bone formation, resulting in gingival bleeding, petechial lesions, articular and bone pain or limb swelling. Children may present anorexia, irritability, failure to thrive, limping or refusal to walk. Accordingly, pediatric scurvy is frequently misdiagnosed with osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, bone and soft tissue tumor, leukemia, bleeding disorders, and rheumatologic conditions. We report the case of a 3-years old child developing scurvy as consequence of strict selective diet; extensive and invasive investigations were undertaken before the correct diagnosis was considered. Despite being considered a rare condition, scurvy still exists nowadays, even in children with no apparent risk factors living in wealthy families. The increasing popularity of dietary restriction for children, especially those with allergies, may potentially enhance the occurrence of scurvy in apparently healthy children. Appropriate dietary anamnesis is fundamental in order to highlight potential nutritional deficit and to avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. Patients without considerable risk factors may benefit from psychological support in order to investigate possible eating disorders.","['Brambilla, Alice', 'Pizza, Cristina', 'Lasagni, Donatella', 'Lachina, Lucia', 'Resti, Massimo', 'Trapani, Sandra']","['Brambilla A', 'Pizza C', 'Lasagni D', 'Lachina L', 'Resti M', 'Trapani S']","['Pediatric Department, University of Florence, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Pediatric Department, University of Florence, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Clinical Pediatric Department, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Clinical Pediatric Department, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Clinical Pediatric Department, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Pediatric Department, University of Florence, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.', 'Clinical Pediatric Department, Anna Meyer Children Hospital, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180501,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,['NOTNLM'],"['eating disorders', 'malnutrition', 'pediatric nutrition', 'scurvy', 'vitamin C deficiency']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/05/22 06:01,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2018.00126 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2018 May 1;6:126. doi: 10.3389/fped.2018.00126. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5946015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While several studies have identified a myriad of germline RUNX1 mutations implicated in this disorder, second-hit mutational events are necessary for patients with hereditary thrombocytopenia to develop full-blown AML. The molecular picture behind this process remains unclear. We describe a patient of Malay descent with an unreported 7-bp germline RUNX1 frameshift deletion, who developed second-hit mutations that could have brought about the leukaemic transformation from a pre-leukaemic state. These mutations were charted through the course of the treatment and stem cell transplant, showing a clear correlation between her clinical presentation and the mutations present. Case presentation: The patient was a 27-year-old Malay woman who presented with AML on the background of hereditary thrombocytopenia affecting her father and 3 brothers. Initial molecular testing revealed the same novel RUNX1 mutation in all 5 individuals. The patient received standard induction, consolidation chemotherapy, and a haploidentical stem cell transplant from her mother with normal RUNX1 profile. Comprehensive genomic analyses were performed at diagnosis, post-chemotherapy and post-transplant. A total of 8 mutations (RUNX1, GATA2, DNMT3A, BCORL1, BCOR, 2 PHF6 and CDKN2A) were identified in the pre-induction sample, of which 5 remained (RUNX1, DNMT3A, BCORL1, BCOR and 1 out of 2 PHF6) in the post-treatment sample and none were present post-transplant. In brief, the 3 mutations which were lost along with the leukemic cells at complete morphological remission were most likely acquired leukemic driver mutations that were responsible for the AML transformation from a pre-leukemic germline RUNX1-mutated state. On the contrary, the 5 mutations that persisted post-treatment, including the germline RUNX1 mutation, were likely to be part of the preleukemic clone. Conclusion: Further studies are necessary to assess the prevalence of these preleukemic and secondary mutations in the larger FPD/AML patient cohort and establish their prognostic significance. Given the molecular heterogeneity of FPD/AML and other AML subtypes, a better understanding of mutational classes and their involvement in AML pathogenesis can improve risk stratification of patients for more effective and targeted therapy.","['Ng, Isaac Ks', 'Lee, Joanne', 'Ng, Christopher', 'Kosmo, Bustamin', 'Chiu, Lily', 'Seah, Elaine', 'Mok, Michelle Meng Huang', 'Tan, Karen', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Chng, Wee-Joo', 'Yan, Benedict', 'Tan, Lip Kun']","['Ng IK', 'Lee J', 'Ng C', 'Kosmo B', 'Chiu L', 'Seah E', 'Mok MMH', 'Tan K', 'Osato M', 'Chng WJ', 'Yan B', 'Tan LK']","['1Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0001 2180 6431grid.4280.e', '2Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, 1E Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block, Level 7, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '3Molecular Diagnosis Centre, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119074 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '3Molecular Diagnosis Centre, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119074 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '3Molecular Diagnosis Centre, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119074 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '2Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, 1E Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block, Level 7, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '4Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599 Singapore.0000 0001 2180 6431grid.4280.e', '3Molecular Diagnosis Centre, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119074 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '4Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599 Singapore.0000 0001 2180 6431grid.4280.e', '5International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto City, 860-0811 Japan.0000 0001 0660 6749grid.274841.c', '6Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, ASTAR, 31 Biopolis Way, Singapore, 138669 Singapore.0000 0004 0620 9737grid.418830.6', '7Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block, Level 12, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0001 2180 6431grid.4280.e', '2Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, 1E Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block, Level 7, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '4Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599 Singapore.0000 0001 2180 6431grid.4280.e', '8Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E, Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block Level 10, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0001 2180 6431grid.4280.e', '3Molecular Diagnosis Centre, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119074 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '2Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Health System, 1E Kent Ridge Road, NUHS Tower Block, Level 7, Singapore, 119228 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e', '3Molecular Diagnosis Centre, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119074 Singapore.0000 0004 0451 6143grid.410759.e']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20180511,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid Leukaemia', 'Familial platelet disorder', 'RUNX1', 'Stem cell transplant']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/05/22 06:01,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2017/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-018-0130-2 [doi]', '130 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2018 May 11;6:16. doi: 10.1186/s40364-018-0130-2. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5948813,,,,,"['NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB).Written informed consent was obtained', 'from the patient for publication for this case report and any accompanying', 'images.

IMiDs are currently used for the treatment of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and B-cell lymphoma; however, little is known about efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We proposed in this study to investigate the relevance of IMiDs therapy for AML treatment. We evaluated the effect of IMiDs on primary AML blasts (n = 24), and the impact in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunosurveillance of AML. Using primary AML cells and an immunodeficient mouse leukemia xenograft model, we showed that IMiDs induce AML cell death in vitro and impair leukemia progression in vivo. In addition, treatment of AML blasts with IMiDs resulted in enhanced allogeneic NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity. Treatment by pomalidomide of AML blasts enhanced lysis, degranulation, and cytokine production by primary allogeneic NK cells. Furthermore, the treatment with lenalidomide of patients with myeloid malignancies resulted in NK cell phenotypic changes similar to those observed in vitro. IMiDs increased CD56 and decreased NKp30, NKp46, and KIR2D expression on NK cells. Finally, AML blasts treatment with IMiDs induced phenotypic alterations including downregulation of HLA-class I. The effect of pomalidomide was not correlated with cereblon expression and A/G polymorphism in AML cells. Our data revealed, a yet unobserved, dual effects on AML affecting both AML survival and their sensitivity to NK immunotherapy using IMiDs. Our study encourages continuing investigation for the use of IMiDs in AML, especially in combination with conventional therapy or immunotherapy strategies.","['Le Roy, Aude', 'Prebet, Thomas',

HTLV-1 replication and transformation are governed by multiple interactions between viral regulatory proteins and host cell factors that remain to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the impact of HTLV-1 infection on the expression of miR-34a, a microRNA whose expression is downregulated in many types of cancer. Results of RT-PCR assays showed that five out of six HTLV-1-positive cell lines expressed higher levels of miR-34a compared to normal PBMC or purified CD4+ T-cells. ATLL cell line ED, which did not express miR-34a, showed methylation of the miR-34a promoter. Newly infected PBMC and samples from 10 ATLL patients also showed a prominent increase in miR-34a expression compared to PBMC controls. The primary miR-34a transcript expressed in infected cell line C91PL contained binding motifs for NF-kappaB and p53. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB with Bay 11-7082 indicated that this pathway contributes to sustain miR-34a levels in infected cells. Treatment of infected cell lines with the p53 activator nutlin-3a resulted in a further increase in miR-34a levels, thus confirming it as a transcriptional target of p53. Nutlin-3a-treated cells showed downregulation of known miR-34a targets including the deacetylase SIRT1, which was accompanied by increased acetylation of p53, a substrate of SIRT1. Transfection of C91PL cells with a miR-34a mimic also led to downregulation of mRNA targets including SIRT1 as well as the pro-apoptotic factor BAX. Unlike nutlin-3a, the miR-34a mimic did not cause cell cycle arrest or reduce cell viability. On the other hand, sequestration of miR-34a with a sponge construct resulted in an increase in death of C91PL cells. These findings provide evidence for a functional role for miR-34a in fine-tuning the expression of target genes that influence the turnover of HTLV-1-infected cells.","['Sharma, Varun K', 'Raimondi, Vittoria', 'Ruggero, Katia', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia A', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', ""D'Agostino, Donna M""]","['Sharma VK', 'Raimondi V', 'Ruggero K', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Cavallari I', 'Silic-Benussi M', 'Ciminale V', ""D'Agostino DM""]","['Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180504,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'miR-34a', 'nutlin-3a', 'p53']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/05/22 06:01,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.00832 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 May 4;9:832. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00832. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5945834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case illustrates the importance of considering GCA as a cause of anemia in elderly patients if MDS is already diagnosed, even in countries where the prevalence of GCA is very low. The simultaneous development of GCA and MDS suggests a common pathogenetic link between these two diseases.","['Senjo, Hajime', 'Higuchi, Takakazu', 'Morimoto, Masaya', 'Koyamada, Ryosuke', 'Yanaoka, Chisun', 'Okada, Sadamu']","['Senjo H', 'Higuchi T', 'Morimoto M', 'Koyamada R', 'Yanaoka C', 'Okada S']","[""Internal Medicine, St. Luke' s International Hospital, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology, St. Luke' s International Hospital, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology, St. Luke' s International Hospital, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology, St. Luke' s International Hospital, Japan."", ""Immuno-Rheumatology Center, St. Luke' s International Hospital, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology, St. Luke' s International Hospital, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180518,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Giant Cell Arteritis/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*diagnosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['anemia', 'elderly', 'giant cell arteritis', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2018/05/22 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/05/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.9791-17 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2018 Oct 1;57(19):2889-2893. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.9791-17.

However, it is so far unclear whether 2i acts through an inductive or selective mechanism. Here, we use continuous time-lapse imaging to quantify the dynamics of death, proliferation, and Nanog expression in mouse ESCs after 2i addition. We show that 2i has a dual effect: it both leads to increased cell death of Nanog low ESCs (selective effect) and induces and maintains high Nanog levels (inductive effect) in single ESCs. Genetic manipulation further showed that presence of NANOG protein is important for cell viability in 2i medium. This demonstrates complex Nanog-dependent effects of 2i treatment on ESC cultures.","['Hastreiter, Simon', 'Skylaki, Stavroula', 'Loeffler, Dirk', 'Reimann, Andreas', 'Hilsenbeck, Oliver', 'Hoppe, Philipp S', 'Coutu, Daniel L', 'Kokkaliaris, Konstantinos D', 'Schwarzfischer, Michael', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Theis, Fabian J', 'Schroeder, Timm']","['Hastreiter S', 'Skylaki S', 'Loeffler D', 'Reimann A', 'Hilsenbeck O', 'Hoppe PS', 'Coutu DL', 'Kokkaliaris KD', 'Schwarzfischer M', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Theis FJ', 'Schroeder T']","['Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Engineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany; Department of Mathematics, Technische Universitat Munchen, 85748 Garching, Germany.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, 4058 Basel, Switzerland; Research Unit Stem Cell Dynamics, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.

In this work, we further extend the application of the DiPyrO tag, which provides amine group reactivity, optical detection capability, and improved electrospray sensitivity, to quantify N-linked glycans enzymatically released from glycoproteins in the glycosylamine form. Duplex DiPyrO tags that differ in mass by 45.3 mDa were used to label the glycosylamine moieties of freshly released N-glycosylamines from glycoprotein standards and human serum proteins. We demonstrate that both MALDI-LTQ-Orbitrap and nano-HILIC LC/MS/MS Fusion Lumos Orbitrap platforms are capable of resolving the singly or multiply charged N-glycans labeled with mass-defect DiPyrO tags. Dynamic range of quantification, based on MS(1) peak intensities, was evaluated across 2 orders of magnitude. With optimized N-glycan release conditions, glycosylamine labeling conditions, and MS acquisition parameters, the N-glycan profiles and abundances in human serum proteins of cancer patients before and after chemotherapy were compared.

Methods: The retrospective study is based on 1 160 consecutive patients who received their first haplo-HSCT for acute leukemia between April 2002 and December 2014 at Peking University Institute of Hematology. The patients were divided into the sex-matched group and sex-mismatched group in terms of the recipient and donor sex. Then we conducted an analysis in four subgroups, male patients with male donors (M-->M), male patients with female donors (F-->M), female patients with female donors (F-->F), and female patients with male donors (M-->F). Transplant outcomes were measured in terms of hematopoietic recovery, acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the above four subgroups. Then univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted. Results: There was a higher 3-year and 5-year NRM but no difference in other transplant outcomes in sex-mismatched group when compared with the sex-matched group. F-->M was compared with M-->M, and the former group had higher 3-year and 5-year cumulative incidences of NRM (25.5% vs 16.1%, P=0.002; 27.1% vs 17.3%, P=0.002), decreased 5-year DFS (56.9% vs 64.4%, P=0.044), decreased 3-year OS (62.6% vs 69.8%, P=0.045). There was no significant difference in 3-year DFS and 5-year OS. There was no significant difference in grade - aGVHD and cGVHD incidence. When F-->F group was compared with M-->F group, only a higher grade - aGVHD incidence (43.9% vs 34.6%, P=0.047) existed. F-->M was proved to be the independent risk factor influencing NRM and OS in multivariate analysis.

The clinical data and laboratory characteristics of CEP12 positive patients (70 cases) were compared with those CEP12 negative patients (260 cases). Results: Compared with CEP12 negative CLL patients, the proportion of hepatomegaly (13.6% vs 4.0%, P=0.011) and LDH>247 U/L (43.3% vs 18.5%, chi(2)=15.892, P<0.001) in CEP12 positive CLL patients were much higher, respectively. There were no significant differences between age, sex, clinical stage, beta(2)-microglobulin level, IGHV mutation ratio and splenomegaly/lymphadenopathy in these two subgroups. However, compared with CEP12 negative patients, CEP12 positive patients had higher ratio of FMC7 (23.8% vs 12.7%, chi(2)=4.730, P=0.030), and lower ratio of CD23 (95.2% vs 99.6%, P=0.033). The overall response rates (ORR) in Fludarabine (without Rituximab), Rituximab (with or without Fludarabine) and the traditional chemotherapy group (chlorambucil, CHOP or CHOP-like) were 77.5% (31/40), 84.8% (56/66) and 45.4% (50/110), respectively. The ORR of the traditional chemotherapy group was lower than that of the Fludarabine group and Rituximab group. For CEP12 positive patients, the ORR was inferior to CEP12 negative patients when only using Fludarabine (P<0.05). However, when using Rituximab, the difference could be eliminated, and the ORR was even a little higher in CEP12 negative patients (91.7% vs 81.0%, P=0.306). Compared with CEP12 negative patients, there were no significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) (chi(2)=0.410, P=0.478) and overall survival (OS) (chi(2)=0.052, P=0.180) for CEP12 positive patients whom the median time from diagnosis to start treatment and OS time was 22.6 (95%CI 15.4-31.7) and 118.5 (95%CI 74.5-162.4) month while the 5-year PFS and OS were (52.9+/-7.6)% and (74.8+/-6.6)%. Conclusions: CEP12 positive CLL patients are more common in hepatomegaly and higher level of LDH. The traditional chemotherapy treatment had the lowest efficacy, and the curative effect of single use of fludarabine is not as good as that of CEP12 negative patients, however, when using Ritaximab, the efficacy could be comparable.","['Lyu, R', 'Li, Z J', 'Li, H', 'Yi, S H', 'Liu, W', 'Wang, T Y', 'Xiong, W J', 'Qiu, L G']","['Lyu R', 'Li ZJ', 'Li H', 'Yi SH', 'Liu W', 'Wang TY', 'Xiong WJ', 'Qiu LG']","['Department of Lymphoma, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', '*Trisomy', 'Vidarabine']",['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical characteristic', 'Leukemia, lymphocytic, chronic', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment outcome', 'Trisomy 12']",2018/05/22 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/05/21 06:00'],"['2018/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.05.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 May 14;39(5):387-391. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.05.008.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",,PMC7342899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Co-immunoprecipitation interaction technology analysis of fusion protein SD-HA functioned by potently binding to the phospho-BCR-ABL Y177 site, Ras, MAPK and Akt activities were observed in the Ad5F35-SD-HA-treated cells. Western blot analyses of SD-HA fusion protein on cell membrane receptor pathway to death cascade caspase-8, caspase-3 and PRAP were performed. Results: Exploration into the underlying mechanisms revealed that Ad5F35-SD-HA infection functioned by binding to the phospho-BCR-ABL Y177 site, which lead to a complex with Grb2. competitively disrupted the Grb2 SH2-phospho-BCR-ABL Y177 formation. The fusion protein SD-HA could reduce the activation of Ras and phosphorylation of MAPK (p-MAPK) and the expression level of p-ELK, inhibition of Ras-MAPK signaling pathway; SD-HA fusion protein could reduce p-Akt and Akt substrate p-GSK with inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of K562 cells. Caspases-8-induced apoptosis signal could be activated by DED protein binding to DED domain of precursor caspases-8. Conclusions: The strategy of fusion protein SD-HA inhibiting-Y177 BCR-ABL and Grb2 binding could be used as a novel entry point for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Huang, Y', 'Zhang, P', 'Du, L', 'Gui, M', 'Feng, W L', 'Peng, Z']","['Huang Y', 'Zhang P', 'Du L', 'Gui M', 'Feng WL', 'Peng Z']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400010, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adenoviridae', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BCR-ABL fusion protein', 'Death effector domain', 'Leukemia, myeloid, chronic', 'Proliferation', 'Src homology 2']",2018/05/22 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/05/21 06:00'],"['2018/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.04.012 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Apr 14;39(4):314-319. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.04.012.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",,PMC7342126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Between November 2012 and September 2015, 37 consecutive patients with AML >/=60 years of age were analyzed. Of them, 19 patients received consolidation therapy with DAC followed by micro-transplantation (microtransplant group). Another 18 ones (chemo group) were treated with DAC plus priming regimen as consolidation chemotherapy in the same period. Results: There were no significant differences in terms of age, WBC count, and disease status of onset between the microtransplant and chemo groups (P>0.05). The two regimens were well tolerated. There was no difference of CTC grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities between the microtransplant and chemo groups (36.8% vs 27.8%, chi(2)=0.347, P=0.728).

Domestic dogs are useful translational models in regenerative medicine, but their embryonic stem cells (cESCs) remain narrowly investigated. Primed-like cESCs expanded in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 (LIF-FGF2) acquire features of naive pluripotency when exposed to chemical inhibitors and LIF (2iL). However, proliferation of cESCs is influenced by the pluripotent state and is comparatively slower than human or mouse PSCs. We propose that different metabolic pathway activities support ATP generation and biomass accumulation necessary for LIF-FGF2 and 2iL cESC proliferation. We found that 2iL cESCs have greater respiratory capacity, altered mitochondrial chain complex stoichiometry and elevated mitochondrial polarization state. Yet, 2iL-enriched cESCs exhibited immature ultrastructure, including previously unrecognized changes to cristae organization. Enhanced ATP level in 2iL cESCs is associated with altered retrograde signalling, whereas LIF-FGF2 cESCs exhibit a lipogenic phenotype. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation impaired proliferation and ATP production in 2iL cESCs but not LIF-FGF2 cESCs, which remained sensitive to glycolysis inhibition. Our study reveals distinct bioenergetic mechanisms contributing to steady-state expansion of distinct canine pluripotent states that can be exploited to improve derivation and culture of canine PSCs.","['Tobias, I C', 'Isaac, R R', 'Dierolf, J G', 'Khazaee, R', 'Cumming, R C', 'Betts, D H']","['Tobias IC', 'Isaac RR', 'Dierolf JG', 'Khazaee R', 'Cumming RC', 'Betts DH']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Lawson Health Research Institute, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Biotron Research Centre, Faculty of Science, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada.

ZEB1, a member of zinc finger-homeodomain family transcription factor, exhibits crucial function in promoting T-cell differentiation and potentially acts as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL. However, the molecular mechanism by which ZEB1 regulates T-ALL leukaemogenesis remains obscure. Here, we showed that oncogenic LIM only 2 (LMO2) could recruit Sap18 and HDAC1 to assemble an epigenetic regulatory complex, thus inducing histone deacetylation in ZEB1 promoter and chromatin remodeling to achieve transcriptional repression. Furthermore, downregulation of ZEB1 by LMO2 complex results in an increased leukaemia stem cell (LSC) phenotype as well as unsensitivity in response to methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy in T-ALL cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that Trichostatin A (TSA, a HDAC inhibitor) addition significantly attenuates MTX unsensitivity caused by dysfunction of LMO2/ZEB1 signaling. In conclusion, these findings have identified a molecular mechanism underlying LMO2/ZEB1-mediated leukaemogenesis, paving a way for treating T-ALL with a new strategy of epigenetic inhibitors.","['Wu, Chao', 'Li, Jianjun', 'Tian, Chenchen', 'Shi, Wen', 'Jiang, Huimin', 'Zhang, Zhen', 'Wang, Hang', 'Zhang, Quansheng', 'Sun, Wei', 'Sun, Peiqing', 'Xiang, Rong', 'Yang, Shuang']","['Wu C', 'Li J', 'Tian C', 'Shi W', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang H', 'Zhang Q', 'Sun W', 'Sun P', 'Xiang R', 'Yang S']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Tianjin First Center Hospital, Tianjin 300192, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Neurovascular Regulation, Medical College of Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.

We studied, in a paediatric cohort of 119 B-ALLs, the relation between the ETV6/RUNX1 aberration and the co-existing subclones with (a) presenting clinical/biological features, (b) early response to treatment(MRD) and (c) long-term outcome over a 12-year period. Patients were homogeneously treated according to BFM-based-protocols. 27/119 patients (22.7%) were ETV6/RUNX1-positive; 19/27 (70.4%) harbored additional genetic abnormalities while 9/19 (33.3%) presented with clonal heterogeneity. The most common abnormalities were del12p13 (37%), 3-6x21q22 (22.2%), del9p21 (18.5%) and 2-3xETV6/RUNX1 (18.5%). MRDd15-positivity (>/=10(-3)) was detected in 44% of the cohort; the corresponding MRD among patients carrying subclones rises to 88.9%. Common features of all relapses were sub-clonal diversity, FCM-MRDd15-positivity and additional del(9p21) while there were no censored relapses among ETV6/RUNX1-positive patients with sole translocation and absence of additional aberrations, within a median follow-up time of 90 months. In our study, the presence of clonal heterogeneity and impaired FCM-MRD clearance among ETV6/RUNX1-positive patients, ultimately influenced prognosis. Longer follow-up is needed in order to further validate these initial results.","['Ampatzidou, M', 'Papadhimitriou, S I', 'Paterakis, G', 'Pavlidis, D', 'Tsitsikas, Kappa', 'Kostopoulos, I V', 'Papadakis, V', 'Vassilopoulos, G', 'Polychronopoulou, S']","['Ampatzidou M', 'Papadhimitriou SI', 'Paterakis G', 'Pavlidis D', 'Tsitsikas Kappa', 'Kostopoulos IV', 'Papadakis V', 'Vassilopoulos G', 'Polychronopoulou S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, ""Aghia Sophia"" Childrens\' Hospital, Athens, Greece.

The HTLV-1 proviral genome encodes several regulatory products within a conserved 3' nucleotide sequence, known as pX; however, it remains unclear how these factors might cooperate or dynamically interact in virus-infected cells. Here we demonstrate that the HTLV-1 latency-maintenance factor p30(II) induces the TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) and counters the oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and cytotoxicity caused by the viral oncoproteins Tax and HBZ. The p30(II) protein cooperates with Tax and HBZ and enhances their oncogenic potential in colony transformation/foci-formation assays. Further, we have shown that TIGAR is highly expressed in HTLV-1-induced tumors associated with oncogene dysregulation and increased angiogenesis in an in vivo xenograft model of HTLV-1-induced T-cell lymphoma. These findings provide the first evidence that p30(II) likely collaborates as an ancillary factor for the major oncoproteins Tax and HBZ during retroviral carcinogenesis.","['Hutchison, Tetiana', 'Malu, Aditi', 'Yapindi, Lacin', 'Bergeson, Rachel', 'Peck, Kendra', 'Romeo, Megan', 'Harrod, Carolyn', 'Pope, Jordan', 'Smitherman, Louisa', 'Gwinn, Wesleigh', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Yates, Courtney', 'Harrod, Robert']","['Hutchison T', 'Malu A', 'Yapindi L', 'Bergeson R', 'Peck K', 'Romeo M', 'Harrod C', 'Pope J', 'Smitherman L', 'Gwinn W', 'Ratner L', 'Yates C', 'Harrod R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.', 'Departments of Medicine and Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, United States.', 'Laboratory Animal Resource Center, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, 6501 Airline Drive, 334-DLS, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, United States.

However, existing gene-set association methods are limited to applications that evaluate differential expression across k2 treatment groups or biological categories. This limitation precludes researchers from most effectively evaluating the association with other phenotypes that may be more clinically meaningful, such as quantitative variables or censored survival time variables. Projection onto the Orthogonal Space Testing (POST) is proposed as a general procedure that can robustly evaluate the association of a gene-set with several different types of phenotypic data (categorical, ordinal, continuous, or censored). For each gene-set, POST transforms the gene profiles into a set of eigenvectors and then uses statistical modeling to compute a set of z-statistics that measure the association of each eigenvector with the phenotype. The overall gene-set statistic is the sum of squared z-statistics weighted by the corresponding eigenvalues. Finally, bootstrapping is used to compute a p-value. POST may evaluate associations with or without adjustment for covariates. In simulation studies, it is shown that the performance of POST in evaluating the association with a categorical phenotype is similar to or exceeds that of existing methods. In evaluating the association of 875 biological processes with the time to relapse of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, POST identified the well-known oncogenic WNT signaling pathway as its top hit. These results indicate that POST can be a very useful tool for evaluating the association of a gene-set with a variety of different phenotypes.

Thymol has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties; thus, thymol is added to many commercially available products including Listerine mouthwash. Thymol is also cytotoxic to HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cells in vitro. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of thymol against oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its anticancer mechanism-of-action. METHODS: The antiproliferative effects of thymol in OSCC Cal27 cells were determined by MTS assays. Antitumor effects were evaluated in Cal27- and HeLa-derived mouse xenografts. Calcium imaging, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) studies, and Western blot analysis of cleaved PARP (c-PARP) evaluated thymol's mechanism-of-action. RESULTS: Thymol had significant, long-lasting antiproliferative effects in vitro. In vivo, thymol displayed significant antitumor effects in Cal27-derived tumors. Thymol's anticancer effects were confirmed in HeLa-derived xenografts demonstrating that thymol effects are not tumor-type specific. Calcium imaging verified calcium influx in Cal27 cells that were reversed with the TRPA1 antagonist, HC030031. However, no calcium influx was seen in HeLa cells indicating that TRP channels do not regulate thymol cytotoxicity. This was confirmed using cell viability assays in which pre-treatment with HC030031 had no effect on thymol cytotoxicity. Instead, DeltaPsim studies revealed that thymol induces significant DeltaPsim depolarization and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide the first evidence of thymol's novel antitumor effects against OSCC in vivo, which do not rely on TRPA1 activity. Instead, we show that thymol induces mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis and may be efficacious against multiple cancers.","['De La Chapa, Jorge J', 'Singha, Prajjal Kanti', 'Lee, Debbie R', 'Gonzales, Cara B']","['De La Chapa JJ', 'Singha PK', 'Lee DR', 'Gonzales CB']","['Department of Comprehensive Dentistry, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio School of Dentistry, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio School of Medicine, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Comprehensive Dentistry, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio School of Dentistry, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Comprehensive Dentistry, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio School of Dentistry, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Cancer Therapy & Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180609,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Phytotherapy', 'TRPA1 Cation Channel/agonists', 'Thymol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tongue Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['TRPA1', 'apoptosis', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'oral squamous cell carcinoma', 'thymol']",2018/05/20 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2018/05/20 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jop.12735 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2018 Aug;47(7):674-682. doi: 10.1111/jop.12735.

In this study, the potential of B. subtilis lipopeptides (a mixture of iturin homologues, concentration of 42.75%) to inhibit chronic myelogenous leukemia was evaluated using K562 myelogenous leukemia cells. The results showed that the lipopeptides could completely inhibit the growth of K562 at 100 muM, with an IC50 value of 65.76 muM. The lipopeptides inhibited the profile of K562 via three pathways: (1) induction of paraptosis indicated by the occurrence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and swelling of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) without membrane blebbing in the presence of a caspase inhibitor; (2) inhibition of autophagy progress illustrated by the upregulated expression of LCII and P62; and (3) induction of apoptosis by causing ROS burst, and induction of the intrinsic pathway indicated by the upregulated expression of cytochrome c (Cyto-c), bax, and bad, together with downregulated expression of Bcl-2. The ROS-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent paraptosis were verified using the ROS inhibitor and caspase inhibitor, respectively. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway was not involved in the lipopeptide's effects on K562. Overall, the B. subtilis lipopeptides (consisting of a majority of iturin) exhibited promising potential in inhibiting chronic myelogenous leukemia in vitro via simultaneously causing paraptosis, apoptosis, and inhibition of autophagy.","['Zhao, Haobin', 'Yan, Lu', 'Xu, Xiaoguang', 'Jiang, Chunmei', 'Shi, Junling', 'Zhang, Yawen', 'Liu, Li', 'Lei, Shuzhen', 'Shao, Dongyan', 'Huang, Qingsheng']","['Zhao H', 'Yan L', 'Xu X', 'Jiang C', 'Shi J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu L', 'Lei S', 'Shao D', 'Huang Q']","[""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China. sjlshi2004@nwpu.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 Youyi West Road, Xi'an, 710072, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180509,Germany,AMB Express,AMB Express,101561785,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer', 'Apoptosis', 'Lipopeptide', 'Paraptosis']",2018/05/20 06:00,2018/05/20 06:01,['2018/05/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13568-018-0606-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13568-018-0606-3 [pii]']",epublish,AMB Express. 2018 May 9;8(1):78. doi: 10.1186/s13568-018-0606-3.,,,PMC5959823,,,"['31471718/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '1701722/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2015BAD16B02/National Key Technology R&D Program', 'CARS-30/Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System', '2017ZDXL-NY-0304/Key research and development plan of Shaanxi Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Review of the Evidence.,101-107,10.1007/s10911-018-9397-z [doi],"The incidence of breast cancer is continuously increasing worldwide, as influenced by many factors that act synergistically. In the last decade there was an increasing interest in the possible viral etiology of human breast cancer. Since then, many viruses have been associated with this disease (murine mammary tumor virus, MMTV; Epstein-Barr virus, EBV; and human papillomavirus, HPV). Recently, BLV has been identified in human breast cancers giving rise to the hypothesis that it could be one of the causative agents of this condition. BLV is a retrovirus distributed worldwide that affects cattle, causing lymphosarcoma in a small proportion of infected animals. Because of its similarity with human retroviruses like HTLV and HIV, BLV was assumed to also be involved in tumor emergence. Based on this assumption, studies were focused on the possible role of BLV in human breast cancer development. We present a compilation of the current knowledge on the subject and some prospective analysis that is required to fully end this controversy.","['Martinez Cuesta, Lucia', 'Lendez, Pamela Anahi', 'Nieto Farias, Maria Victoria', 'Dolcini, Guillermina Laura', 'Ceriani, Maria Carolina']","['Martinez Cuesta L', 'Lendez PA', 'Nieto Farias MV', 'Dolcini GL', 'Ceriani MC']","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Facultad de Cs.

METHODS: The expression of VEGFR2, NRP-1, related signaling molecules, abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL-1), and RAD51 were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Radiosensitivity was assessed using the colony-forming assay, and the cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We selected two cell lines with high expression levels of VEGFR2, including Calu-1 cells that have high NRP-1 expression, and H358 cells that have low NRP-1 expression. Upon inhibition of p-VEGFR2 by apatinib in Calu-1 cells, the expression of NRP-1 protein and other related proteins in the pathway was still high. Upon NRP-1 siRNA treatment, the expression of both NRP-1 and RAD51 decreased (p < 0.01; p < 0.05). Upon ABL-1 siRNA treatment, the expression of NRP-1 was increased and the expression of RAD51 was unchanged. Calu-1 cells treated with NRP-1 siRNA exhibited significantly higher apoptosis and radiation sensitivity in radiation therapy compared to Calu-1 cells treated with apatinib alone (p < 0.01; p < 0.01). The apoptosis and radiation sensitivity in H358 cells with NRP-1 overexpression was similar to the control group regardless of VEGFR2 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that when VEGFR2 was inhibited, NRP-1 appeared to regulate RAD51 expression through the VEGFR2-independent ABL-1 pathway, consequently regulating radiation sensitivity. In addition, the combined inhibition of VEGFR2 and NRP-1 appears to sensitize cancer cells to radiation.","['Hu, Chenxi', 'Zhu, Panrong', 'Xia, Youyou', 'Hui, Kaiyuan', 'Wang, Mei', 'Jiang, Xiaodong']","['Hu C', 'Zhu P', 'Xia Y', 'Hui K', 'Wang M', 'Jiang X']","['Tumor Laboratory, Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China.', 'Tumor Laboratory, Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China.', 'Tumor Laboratory, Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China.', 'Tumor Laboratory, Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China. jxdysy1970@163.com.', 'Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No.182 North Tongguan Road, Lianyungang, 222002, China. jxdysy1970@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180517,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Neuropilin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Rad51 Recombinase/biosynthesis', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['NRP-1', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Radiosensitivity', 'VEGFR2']",2018/05/20 06:00,2018/06/29 06:00,['2018/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-018-2667-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-018-2667-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2018 Jul;144(7):1329-1337. doi: 10.1007/s00432-018-2667-8.

While studies of selected MLL-fusions have revealed critical molecular pathways, unifying mechanisms across all MLL-fusions remain poorly understood. We present the first comprehensive survey of protein-protein interactions of seven distantly related MLL-fusion proteins. Functional investigation of 128 conserved MLL-fusion-interactors identifies a specific role for the lysine methyltransferase SETD2 in MLL-leukemia. SETD2 loss causes growth arrest and differentiation of AML cells, and leads to increased DNA damage. In addition to its role in H3K36 tri-methylation, SETD2 is required to maintain high H3K79 di-methylation and MLL-AF9-binding to critical target genes, such as Hoxa9. SETD2 loss synergizes with pharmacologic inhibition of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L to induce DNA damage, growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. These results uncover a dependency for SETD2 during MLL-leukemogenesis, revealing a novel actionable vulnerability in this disease.","['Skucha, Anna', 'Ebner, Jessica', 'Schmollerl, Johannes', 'Roth, Mareike', 'Eder, Thomas', 'Cesar-Razquin, Adrian', 'Stukalov, Alexey', 'Vittori, Sarah', 'Muhar, Matthias', 'Lu, Bin', 'Aichinger, Martin', 'Jude, Julian', 'Muller, Andre C', 'Gyorffy, Balazs', 'Vakoc, Christopher R', 'Valent, Peter', 'Bennett, Keiryn L', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Grebien, Florian']","['Skucha A', 'Ebner J', 'Schmollerl J', 'Roth M', 'Eder T', 'Cesar-Razquin A', 'Stukalov A', 'Vittori S', 'Muhar M', 'Lu B', 'Aichinger M', 'Jude J', 'Muller AC', 'Gyorffy B', 'Vakoc CR', 'Valent P', 'Bennett KL', 'Zuber J', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Grebien F']","['CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, 1030, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, 1030, Austria.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Larboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, 11724, NY, USA.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, 1030, Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, 1030, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, Institute of Enzymology, Second Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, 1094, Hungary.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Larboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, 11724, NY, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I.

Methods: Six patients with heavily pretreated relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (3 men, 3 women; aged, 54 +/- 8 y) underwent CXCR4-directed RLT in combination with conditioning chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In 2 patients, radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20 or CD66 was added to enhance antilymphoma activity. Endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: RLT and additional radioimmunotherapy were well tolerated, without any acute adverse events or changes in vital signs. Successful engraftment was recorded after a median of 11 d (range, 9-13 d). Of the 4 patients who were available for follow-up (one patient died of CNS aspergillosis 29 d after RLT and another of sepsis in aplasia 34 d after RLT), CXCR4-directed RLT resulted in a partial response in two (both treated with additional radioimmunotherapy) and a mixed response in the remaining two. The response duration was rather short-lived, with a median progression-free survival of 62 d (range, 29-110 d) and a median overall survival of 76 d (range, 29-334 d). Conclusion: CXCR4-directed RLT (in combination with additional radioimmunotherapy) is feasible as a conditioning regimen before allogeneic stem cell transplantation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Lapa, Constantin', 'Hanscheid, Heribert', 'Kircher, Malte', 'Schirbel, Andreas', 'Wunderlich, Gerd', 'Werner, Rudolf A', 'Samnick, Samuel', 'Kotzerke, Jorg', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Buck, Andreas K', 'Wester, Hans-Jurgen', 'Grigoleit, Gotz Ulrich']","['Lapa C', 'Hanscheid H', 'Kircher M', 'Schirbel A', 'Wunderlich G', 'Werner RA', 'Samnick S', 'Kotzerke J', 'Einsele H', 'Buck AK', 'Wester HJ', 'Grigoleit GU']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany lapa_c@ukw.de.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Pharmaceutical Radiochemistry, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180518,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,IM,"['Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiometry', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Safety', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCR4', '*DLBCL', '*chemokine receptors', '*lymphoma', '*radioligand therapy']",2018/05/20 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/05/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['jnumed.118.210997 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.118.210997 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2019 Jan;60(1):60-64. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.118.210997.

Treatment goals are primarily to preserve life, and then the functionality of the bladder. There is no standard therapeutic approach for HC. Described treatment options provide low success rates and are related to potential life-threatening side effects. The aim of this study was to describe our experience in treatment of HC following HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with HC treated at our institution between January 2010 and October 2016. We analyzed demographics, underlying diagnosis, and treatment modalities. RESULTS: We treated 39 patients with HC. Mean age was 9.4 years (SD 4.20) and 64% were males. Acute leukemia was the most common underlying diagnosis in 27 (69%). Mean time from HSCT to HC onset was 55.46 days (SD 112.35). HC grades were: I (3), II (21), III (8), and IV (7). BK-viuria was present in 34 patients (87.2%). Non-invasive treatment was performed in 28 patients (71.8%). The remaining 11 (28.2%) required urological intervention (all high-grade), consisting of bladder irrigation in all of these. Additional treatments consisted of: intravesical cidofovir (4), intravesical sodium hyaluronate (5), cystoscopy and clot evacuation (4), selective angioembolization (2), percutaneous nephrostomy (1), and open extraction of bladder clots and cutaneous cystotomy (1). Overall, eight patients (20.5%) died as a result of the malignancy (3 in the urological intervention group), and of these four had active HC at death. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months (SD 24.9). CONCLUSION: HC is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Treatment should be individualized and designed to prioritize survival. However, bladder function should be preserved for the future.","['Gander, Romy', 'Asensio, Marino', 'Guillen, Gabriela', 'Royo, Gloria Fatou', 'Bolanos, Andrea', 'Perez, Mercedes', 'Diaz-De-Heredia, Cristina', 'Benitez, Maribel', 'Lopez, Manuel']","['Gander R', 'Asensio M', 'Guillen G', 'Royo GF', 'Bolanos A', 'Perez M', 'Diaz-De-Heredia C', 'Benitez M', 'Lopez M']","[""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Urology and Renal Transplant Unit, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.

Protection against GAS infection is thought to be mediated by phagocytosis, enhanced by bacteria-specific antibody. There are no licenced GAS vaccines, despite many promising candidates in preclinical and early stage clinical development, the most advanced of which are based on the GAS M-protein. Vaccine progress has been hindered, in part, by the lack of a standardised functional assay suitable for vaccine evaluation. Current assays, developed over 50 years ago, rely on non-immune human whole blood as a source of neutrophils and complement. Variations in complement and neutrophil activity between donors result in variable data that is difficult to interpret. We have developed an opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPKA) for GAS that utilises dimethylformamide (DMF)-differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) as a source of neutrophils and baby rabbit complement, thus removing the major sources of variation in current assays. We have standardised the OPKA for several clinically relevant GAS strain types (emm1, emm6 and emm12) and have shown antibody-specific killing for each emm-type using M-protein specific rabbit antisera. Specificity was demonstrated by pre-incubation of the antisera with homologous M-protein antigens that blocked antibody-specific killing. Additional qualifications of the GAS OPKA, including the assessment of the accuracy, precision, linearity and the lower limit of quantification, were also performed. This GAS OPKA assay has the potential to provide a robust and reproducible platform to accelerate GAS vaccine development.","['Jones, Scott', 'Moreland, Nicole J', 'Zancolli, Marta', 'Raynes, Jeremy', 'Loh, Jacelyn M S', 'Smeesters, Pierre R', 'Sriskandan, Shiranee', 'Carapetis, Jonathan R', 'Fraser, John D', 'Goldblatt, David']","['Jones S', 'Moreland NJ', 'Zancolli M', 'Raynes J', 'Loh JMS', 'Smeesters PR', 'Sriskandan S', 'Carapetis JR', 'Fraser JD', 'Goldblatt D']","['Immunobiology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.

Molecular markers, including CALR mutations, were considered not only as diagnostic markers, but also as risk factors for bleeding and thrombosis associated with MPN, especially for patients in remote primary hospitals. We sought to develop an easy-to-use assay for the rapid detection of CALR type 1 (CALR-1) and type 2 (CALR-2) mutations in Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPN patients. Peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid (PNA-LNA) clamping loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays were established, which were integrated into a centrifugal compact disc (CD) microfluidic platform. A total of 158 clinical blood samples were tested simultaneously by this microfluidic platform and an in-house real time PCR assay. The detection performance of the LAMP arrays was validated and conflicting results were identified by Sanger sequencing. The results suggested that the LAMP methods we developed exhibited good sensitivity, specificity, and precision. By real time fluorescence assay the detection limit for CALR-1 and CALR-2 mutations could reach as low as 1% and 0.5% respectively, and 10% and 5% respectively by visual method. There were no nonspecific background amplifications among different detection systems. For the CALR-1 and CALR-2 LAMP detection systems, intra-batch CV values of 1% mutated plasmid were 10.56% and 10.51% respectively, and the inter-batch CV values were 19.55% and 18.39%, respectively. The products were all analyzed by melting curve analysis and electrophoresis followed by Sanger sequencing analysis, which were consistent with the database sequences. The microfluidic platform could complete rapid detection of CALR-1/2 mutations within 60min. The results of clinical samples detected by our CD-like microfluidic chipLAMP assay and rtPCR assay suggested that 133 samples were CALR wild type, 15 were CALR-1 mutation type, and 9 were CALR-2 mutation type. The correlation coefficient value (Kendall's tau_b) of the two assays was 0.99. Interestingly, by the newly established detection platform, we were surprised to find that one patient of Chinese origin harbored both CALR-1 and CALR-2 mutations. This result was verified by Sanger sequencing analysis. The LAMP detection systems developed herein displayed good sensitivity, specificity, and stability. Additionally, the detection results could be directly judged by color changes of the reaction systems without any auxiliary equipment. Thus, the platform we developed has the potential of being widely used in remote and economically undeveloped areas in the future.","['Cao, Guojun', 'Kong, Jilie', 'Xing, Zhifang', 'Tang, Yigui', 'Zhang, Xinju', 'Xu, Xiao', 'Kang, Zhihua', 'Fang, Xueen', 'Guan, Ming']","['Cao G', 'Kong J', 'Xing Z', 'Tang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Xu X', 'Kang Z', 'Fang X', 'Guan M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, PR China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, PR China; Shanghai Suxin Co.

Clinical studies have found that acute T-lymphocyte leukaemia patients are susceptible to Toxoplasma gondii infection; however, the effect of T. gondii on the proliferation and apoptosis of human leukaemia T-cells remains unclear. Here, we used the T. gondii ME-49 strain to infect human leukaemia T-cell lines Jurkat and Molt-4, to explore the effect of T. gondii on proliferation and apoptosis, which is mediated by NF-kappaB in human leukaemia T-cells. METHODS: The Tunel assay was used to detect cell apoptosis. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect cell proliferation viability. The apoptosis level and the expression level of NF-kappaB related proteins in human leukaemia T-cells were detected by flow cytometry and Western blotting. RESULTS: Western blotting analyses revealed that the T. gondii ME-49 strain increased the expression of A20 and decreased both ABIN1 expression and NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation. By constructing a lentiviral-mediated shRNA to knockdown the A20 gene in Jurkat T-cells and Molt-4 T-cells, the apoptosis levels of the two cell lines decreased after T. gondii ME-49 infection, and levels of NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation and ABIN1 were higher than in the non-konckdown group. After knockingdown ABIN1 gene expression by constructing the lentiviral-mediated shRNA and transfecting the recombinant expression plasmid containing the ABIN1 gene into two cell lines, apoptosis levels and cleaved caspase-8 expression increased or decreased in response to T. gondii ME-49 infection, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ABIN1 protects human leukaemia T-cells by allowing them to resist the apoptosis induced by T. gondii ME-49 and that the T. gondii ME-49 strain induces the apoptosis of human leukaemia T-cells via A20-mediated downregulation of ABIN1 expression.","['Chen, Qian', 'Pang, Min-Hui', 'Ye, Xiao-Hong', 'Yang, Guang', 'Lin, Chen']","['Chen Q', 'Pang MH', 'Ye XH', 'Yang G', 'Lin C']","[""Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Health statistics, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Parasitology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Parasitology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510632, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510632, People's Republic of China. tlinc@jnu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180518,England,Parasit Vectors,Parasites & vectors,101462774,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Toxoplasma/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3/deficiency/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*A20', '*ABIN1', '*Apoptosis', '*Human leukaemia T-cells', '*Toxoplasma gondii ME-49 strain']",2018/05/20 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2018/05/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13071-018-2837-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13071-018-2837-1 [pii]']",epublish,Parasit Vectors. 2018 May 18;11(1):305. doi: 10.1186/s13071-018-2837-1.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNIP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)']",,PMC5960183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring the activity of the oncogenic fusion gene BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a good example of individualizing CML treatment for patients using patient-specific genetic information. However, the frequency at which molecular monitoring for BCR-ABL1 transcripts occurs during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for CML in clinical practice is much lower than that recommended by either the National Cancer Center Network or the European LeukemiaNet guidelines. Adherence, one of the most critical factors affecting response to TKIs, is often less than desirable and rarely communicated to physicians by patients or managed by care providers.

This distinguishes Mcl-1 from other antiapoptotic proteins and necessitates further study to better understand how interactions with proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins affect its regulation. One such protein, Bim, is known to stabilize Mcl-1, and Bim phosphorylation has been associated with increased Mcl-1 binding. Consequently, we investigated the potential impact of Bim phosphorylation on Mcl-1 stability. We found that Bim stabilizes and primes Mcl-1 in RPCI-WM1 cells and is constitutively phosphorylated. Additionally, introduction of several phospho-mimetic and unphosphosphorylateable Bim mutations resulted in altered Mcl-1 stability and distinct Bim binding to antiapoptotic proteins. These findings suggest Bim phosphorylation not only regulates Mcl-1 stability but also is a potential mechanism for enforcing Mcl-1 dependence.","['Conage-Pough, Jason E', 'Boise, Lawrence H']","['Conage-Pough JE', 'Boise LH']","['Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180529,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plasma Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bim phosphorylation', '*Mcl-1 stability', '*priming']",2018/05/19 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.14505 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2018 Jul;285(14):2626-2640. doi: 10.1111/febs.14505.

Recent results indicate that checkpoint inhibition also represents a very promising approach for certain types of hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is also associated with substantial toxicities and high costs and only a subset of patients appears to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. This demonstrates the urgent need for biomarkers for the identification of patient populations that are likely to respond to this type of therapy and/or have fewer side effects. Here, we have reviewed available information on the prognostic and predictive value of biomarkers for anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 as the most commonly used checkpoint inhibitors. There are currently no reliable biomarkers capable of predicting responses to anti-CTLA-4 agents, such as ipilimumab, in hematologic malignancies. Certain polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 gene, however, seem to have an impact on the patients' outcome, especially in the case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). There is now sufficient data supporting PD-L1 expression levels in the tumor tissue as an independent prognostic factor in B cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Overexpression of PD-L1 in the tumor tissue and elevated serum levels of soluble PD-L1 may also represent adverse prognostic factors in certain subtypes of T cell lymphomas. Finally, expression levels of PD-L1 also seem to predict responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 approaches in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Future studies will have to further delineate the prognostic/predictive role of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker in hematologic malignancies and may be able to identify confounding variables, which will hopefully to some extent be generalizable to other types of anti-tumor immunotherapies.","['Atanackovic, Djordje', 'Luetkens, Tim']","['Atanackovic D', 'Luetkens T']","['Multiple Myeloma Program & Cancer Immunology, Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah/Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.

A dynamic treatment regime is a sequence of decision rules, each mapping a patient's observed history to the set of available, feasible treatment options at each decision point, and thus formalizes this process. An optimal regime is one leading to the most beneficial outcome on average if used to select treatment for the patient population. We propose a method for estimation of an optimal regime involving two decision points when the outcome of interest is a censored survival time, which is based on maximizing a locally efficient, doubly robust, augmented inverse probability weighted estimator for average outcome over a class of regimes. By casting this optimization as a classification problem, we exploit well-studied classification techniques such as support vector machines to characterize the class of regimes and facilitate implementation via a backward iterative algorithm. Simulation studies of performance and application of the method to data from a sequential, multiple assignment randomized clinical trial in acute leukemia are presented.","['Hager, Rebecca', 'Tsiatis, Anastasios A', 'Davidian, Marie']","['Hager R', 'Tsiatis AA', 'Davidian M']","['Division of Biometrics III, OB/CDER, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S.A.', 'Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A.', 'Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180518,United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Algorithms', 'Biometry/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods/standards', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Support Vector Machine', '*Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Doubly robust', '*Inverse probability weighting', '*Optimal treatment regime', '*Sequential multiple assignment randomized trial', '*Support vector machine', '*Value search']",2018/05/19 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/biom.12894 [doi]'],ppublish,Biometrics. 2018 Dec;74(4):1180-1192. doi: 10.1111/biom.12894.

Flow cytometry allows us to determine a fraction of immature myeloid cells in a semiautomated procedure. The aim of this study, mirroring IPSS-R study inclusion criteria, was to test whether bone marrow (BM) CD34+My percentage has independent prognostic value in the MDS setting. METHODS: BM CD34+My cells were quantified, at diagnosis, selecting CD34+/CD45+/CD11b+/-/CD13+. Patients were excluded when receiving treatment for altering the natural course of the disease and when IPSS-R could not be calculated due to the lack of metaphases. Finally, Cox analyses were performed, on a series of 260 patients, for overall survival (OS) and time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. RESULTS: By analyzing ROC curves, the most accurate prognostic variable, regarding blasts by cytology and CD34+ by cytometry, was the percentage of blasts by microscopy. The percentage of CD34+My in BM showed an AUC of 0.767 and 0.576 for time to AML transformation and OS, respectively. When performing a multivariate regression including the IPSS-R and the percentage of BM CD34+My cells >1%, both factors predicted for a shorter time to AML transformation. In addition, CD34+My percentage successfully stratified the intermediate IPSS-R category into two prognostic groups with a relative risk of 5.73 (95% CI [1.2-27.8]; P = .03). CONCLUSION: We found that BM CD34+My percentage has an independent value concerning the IPSS-R, especially relevant for the prediction of transformation to AML and within the intermediate group.","['Chen-Liang, T-H', 'Casado-Prieto, A M', 'Campos-Rodriguez, V', 'Hurtado, A M', 'Amigo, M L', 'Garcia-Malo, M D', 'Vicente, V', 'Ortuno, F J', 'Jerez, A']","['Chen-Liang TH', 'Casado-Prieto AM', 'Campos-Rodriguez V', 'Hurtado AM', 'Amigo ML', 'Garcia-Malo MD', 'Vicente V', 'Ortuno FJ', 'Jerez A']","['Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Morales Meseguer University Hospital, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180518,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['flow cytometry', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'outcomes']",2018/05/19 06:00,2018/05/19 06:01,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:01 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12860 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2018 Oct;40(5):549-555. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12860.

However, it is unclear whether the biotransformation of arsenic by AS3MT contributes to the promotion of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) therapy. In order to understand the probable role of AS3MT in APL patients, we evaluated the effects of arsenite (iAsIII) and three mixed arsenicals (i.e., iAsIII, MMAIII and DMAIII, to mimic active arsenic species in the blood) on NB4 cell differentiation and apoptosis. Although the mixed arsenicals exhibited about 2 fold less effect on the induction of NB4 cell differentiation and PML-RARalpha fusion protein degradation, they showed 5 times stronger ability to induce apoptosis when compared with iAsIII. More importantly, the proliferation of NB4 cells was significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited in a transwell system co-cultured with AS3MT-transfected HepG2 cells after exposure to iAsIII, suggesting that the generation of methylated metabolites restrained cell proliferation. These findings indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of As2O3 (i.e., iAsIII) in APL patients is probably associated with the production of methylated arsenic metabolites (i.e., MMAIII and DMAIII) by AS3MT.","['Maimaitiyiming, Yasen', 'Wang, Chao', 'Xu, Shi', 'Islam, Khairul', 'Chen, Ye Jia', 'Yang, Chang', 'Wang, Qian Qian', 'Naranmandura, Hua']","['Maimaitiyiming Y', 'Wang C', 'Xu S', 'Islam K', 'Chen YJ', 'Yang C', 'Wang QQ', 'Naranmandura H']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/04/20 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8mt00057c [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2018 Jun 20;10(6):828-837. doi: 10.1039/c8mt00057c.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.137 (AS3MT protein, human)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Successful experiments in inhibiting the growth of human cancer cell lines using Saudi plants were published over the last three decades. Up to date, there is no Saudi anticancer plants database as a comprehensive source for the interesting data generated from these experiments. Therefore, there was a need for creating a database to collect, organize, search and retrieve such data. As a result, the current paper describes the generation of the Saudi anti-human cancer plants database (SACPD). The database contains most of the reported information about the naturally growing Saudi anticancer plants. SACPD comprises the scientific and local names of 91 plant species that grow naturally in Saudi Arabia. These species belong to 38 different taxonomic families. In Addition, 18 species that represent16 family of medicinal plants and are intensively sold in the local markets in Saudi Arabia were added to the database. The website provides interesting details, including plant part containing the anticancer bioactive compounds, plants locations and cancer/cell type against which they exhibit their anticancer activity. Our survey revealed that breast, liver and leukemia were the most studied cancer cell lines in Saudi Arabia with percentages of 27%, 19% and 15%, respectively. The current SACPD represents a nucleus around which more development efforts can expand to accommodate all future submissions about new Saudi plant species with anticancer activities.

Mutations, overexpression and loss of expression of subunits of the PAF1c are observed in various forms of cancer suggesting proper regulation is needed for cellular development. However, the biochemical interactions with the PAF1c that allow dynamic gene regulation are unclear. We and others have shown that the PAF1c makes a direct interaction with MLL fusion proteins, which are potent oncogenic drivers of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This interaction is critical for the maintenance of MLL translocation driven AML by targeting MLL fusion proteins to the target genes Meis1 and Hoxa9. Here, we use a proteomics approach to identify protein-protein interactions with the PAF1c subunit CDC73 that regulate the function of the PAF1c. We identified a novel interaction with a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase protein, SETDB1. This interaction is stabilized with a mutant CDC73 that is incapable of supporting AML cell growth. Importantly, transcription of Meis1 and Hoxa9 is reduced and promoter H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) increased by overexpression of SETDB1 or stabilization of the PAF1c-SETDB1 interaction in AML cells. These findings were corroborated in human AML patients where increased SETDB1 expression was associated with reduced HOXA9 and MEIS1. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomics approach to search for CDC73 protein-protein interactions in AML, and demonstrates that the PAF1c may play a role in H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional repression in AML.","['Ropa, James', 'Saha, Nirmalya', 'Chen, Zhiling', 'Serio, Justin', 'Chen, Wei', 'Mellacheruvu, Dattatreya', 'Zhao, Lili', 'Basrur, Venkatesha', 'Nesvizhskii, Alexey I', 'Muntean, Andrew G']","['Ropa J', 'Saha N', 'Chen Z', 'Serio J', 'Chen W', 'Mellacheruvu D', 'Zhao L', 'Basrur V', 'Nesvizhskii AI', 'Muntean AG']","['Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and The University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180424,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['H3K9 methyltransferase', 'leukemia', 'polymerase associated factor complex', 'protein-protein interaction', 'transcription']",2018/05/19 06:00,2018/05/19 06:01,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25204 [doi]', '25204 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 24;9(31):22123-22136. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25204. eCollection 2018 Apr 24.,,,PMC5955148,,,"['R01 GM094231/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA140044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA210967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations in Ptpn11 are the most frequent cause of JMML and they commonly occur in utero. Animal models of mutant Ptpn11 have probed the signaling pathways that contribute to JMML. However, existing models may inappropriately exacerbate MPN features by relying on non-hematopoietic-restricted Cre-loxP strains or transplantations into irradiated recipients. In this study we generate hematopoietic-restricted models of Ptpn11E76K-mediated disease using Csf1r-MCM and Flt3Cre. We show that these animals have indolent MPN progression despite robust GM-CSF hypersensitivity and Ras-Erk hyperactivation. Rather, the dominant pathology is pronounced thrombocytopenia with expanded extramedullary hematopoiesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing of tamoxifen administration in Csf1r-MCM mice can specifically induce recombinase activity in either fetal or adult hematopoietic progenitors. We take advantage of this technique to show more rapid monocytosis following Ptpn11E76K expression in fetal progenitors compared with adult progenitors. Finally, we demonstrate that Ptpn11E76K results in the progressive reduction of T cells, most notably of CD4+ and naive T cells. This corresponds to an increased frequency of T cell progenitors in the thymus and may help explain the occasional emergence of T-cell leukemias in JMML patients. Overall, our study is the first to describe the consequences of hematopoietic-restricted Ptpn11E76K expression in the absence of irradiation.

BCR-ABL oncogene activates multiple cross-talking signal transduction pathways (STP), such as RAS/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, Wnt and STAT5, contributing to abnormal proliferation of clonal cells. From this perspective, the aim of this study was to analyze the expression and activation profile of STP involved in the mechanisms of cell proliferation/quiescence and survival of the progenitor CD34+ cells from chronic phase (CP) CML. Our results showed that CP-CML CD34+ progenitors were characterized by significant lower phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of growth and cell survival, such as tyrosine kinases of the Src family and members of STAT family, and by a significant higher phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15), compared to normal CD34+ cells from healthy donors. Consistent with these results, cell cycle analysis demonstrated that CP-CML CD34+ cells were characterized by higher percentage of cells in G0-phase compared to normal CD34+ cells. Analysis of expression profile on proteins involved in the apoptotic machinery revealed that, in addition, CD34+ cells from CP-CML were characterized by a significant lower expression of catalase and higher expression of HSP27 and FADD. In sum, we report that CD34+ cells from CP-CML are characterized by a proteomic and phospho-proteomic profile that promotes quiescence through the inhibition of proliferation and the promotion of survival.

GSLs play essential roles in maintenance of plasma membrane stability, in regulation of numerous cellular processes (including adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, and recognition), and in modulation of signal transduction pathways. GSLs have traditionally been classified as ganglio-series, lacto-series, or globo-series on the basis of their diverse types of oligosaccharide chains. Structures and functions of specific GSLs are also determined by their oligosaccharide chains. Different cells and tissues show differential expression of GSLs, and changes in structures of GSL glycan moieties occur during development of numerous types of human cancer. Association of GSLs and/or related enzymes with initiation and progression of cancer has been documented in 100s of studies, and many such GSLs are useful markers or targets for cancer diagnosis or therapy. In this review, we summarize (i) recent studies on aberrant expression and distribution of GSLs in common human cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma, prostate, ovarian, leukemia, renal, bladder, gastric); (ii) biological functions of specific GSLs in these cancers.","['Zhuo, Dinghao', 'Li, Xiang', 'Guan, Feng']","['Zhuo D', 'Li X', 'Guan F']","['Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of China, College of Life Science, Northwest University, Xi'an, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180503,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,['NOTNLM'],"['aberrant expression', 'cancer development', 'cellular processes', 'glycosphingolipids', 'signaling pathway']",2018/05/19 06:00,2018/05/19 06:01,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2018.00466 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2018 May 3;9:466. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00466. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5943571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a two-step purification of a modified SUMO3, we profiled the SUMO proteome of senescent cells in a site-specific manner. We identified 25 SUMO sites on 23 proteins that were significantly regulated during senescence. Of note, most of these proteins were PML nuclear body (PML-NB) associated, which correlates with the increased number and size of PML-NBs observed in senescent cells. Interestingly, the sole SUMO E2 enzyme, UBC9, was more SUMOylated during senescence on its Lys-49. Functional studies of a UBC9 mutant at Lys-49 showed a decreased association to PML-NBs and the loss of UBC9's ability to delay senescence. We thus propose both pro- and anti-senescence functions of protein SUMOylation.","['McManus, Francis P', 'Bourdeau, Veronique', 'Acevedo, Mariana', 'Lopes-Paciencia, Stephane', 'Mignacca, Lian', 'Lamoliatte, Frederic', 'Rojas Pino, John W', 'Ferbeyre, Gerardo', 'Thibault, Pierre']","['McManus FP', 'Bourdeau V', 'Acevedo M', 'Lopes-Paciencia S', 'Mignacca L', 'Lamoliatte F', 'Rojas Pino JW', 'Ferbeyre G', 'Thibault P']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada. g.ferbeyre@umontreal.ca.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada. pierre.thibault@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Chemistry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada. pierre.thibault@umontreal.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180517,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-25150-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-25150-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 May 17;8(1):7754. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-25150-z.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",,PMC5958138,,,['RN196161-300726/CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the cell-intrinsic functions of IL1RAP in AML cells are largely unknown. Here, we show that targeting of IL1RAP via RNA interference, genetic deletion, or antibodies inhibits AML pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo, without perturbing healthy hematopoietic function or viability. Furthermore, we found that the role of IL1RAP is not restricted to the IL-1 receptor pathway, but that IL1RAP physically interacts with and mediates signaling and pro-proliferative effects through FLT3 and c-KIT, two receptor tyrosine kinases with known key roles in AML pathogenesis. Our study provides a new mechanistic basis for the efficacy of IL1RAP targeting in AML and reveals a novel role for this protein in the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Mitchell, Kelly', 'Barreyro, Laura', 'Todorova, Tihomira I', 'Taylor, Samuel J', 'Antony-Debre, Ileana', 'Narayanagari, Swathi-Rao', 'Carvajal, Luis A', 'Leite, Joana', 'Piperdi, Zubair', 'Pendurti, Gopichand', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Verma, Amit', 'Gritsman, Kira', 'Steidl, Ulrich']","['Mitchell K', 'Barreyro L', 'Todorova TI', 'Taylor SJ', 'Antony-Debre I', 'Narayanagari SR', 'Carvajal LA', 'Leite J', 'Piperdi Z', 'Pendurti G', 'Mantzaris I', 'Paietta E', 'Verma A', 'Gritsman K', 'Steidl U']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ulrich.steidl@einstein.yu.edu.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180517,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20180147 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20180147 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2018 Jun 4;215(6):1709-1727. doi: 10.1084/jem.20180147.

Treatment consists of one course of fludarabine, cytarabine and liposomal daunorubicin, followed by fludarabine and cytarabine and stem-cell transplantation. Study ITCC 020/I-BFM 2009-02 aimed to identify the recommended phase II dose of clofarabine replacing fludarabine in the abovementioned combination regimen (3+3 design). Escalating dose levels of clofarabine (20-40 mg/m(2)/day x 5 days) and liposomal daunorubicin (40-80 mg/m(2)/day) were administered with cytarabine (2 g/m(2)/day x 5 days). Liposomal DNR was given on day 1, 3 and 5 only. The cohort at the recommended phase II dose was expanded to make a preliminary assessment of anti-leukemic activity. Thirty-four children were enrolled: refractory 1(st) (n=11), early 1st (n=15), >/=2(nd) relapse (n=8). Dose level 3 (30 mg/m(2)clofarabine; 60 mg/m(2)liposomal daunorubicin) appeared to be safe only in patients without subclinical fungal infections. Infectious complications were dose-limiting. The recommended phase II dose was 40 mg/m(2) clofarabine with 60 mg/m(2) liposomal daunorubicin. Side-effects mainly consisted of infections. The overall response rate was 68% in 31 response evaluable patients, and 80% at the recommended phase II dose (n=10); 22 patients proceeded to stem cell transplantation. The 2-year probability of event-free survival (pEFS) was 26.5+/-7.6 and probability of survival (pOS) 32.4+/-8.0%. In the 21 responding patients, the 2-year pEFS was 42.9+/-10.8 and pOS 47.6+/-10.9%. Clofarabine exposure in plasma was not significantly different from that in single-agent studies. In conclusion, clofarabine was well tolerated and showed high response rates in relapsed/refractory pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with (sub) clinical fungal infections should be treated with caution. Clofarabine has been taken forward in the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster study for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

Activation of these additional kinases may also result in phosphorylation of tumor suppressor proteins promoting their nuclear export. Thus, co-targeting nuclear export proteins (e.g., XPO1) and FLT3 concomitantly may be therapeutically effective. Here we report on the combinatorial inhibition of XPO1 using selinexor and FLT3 using sorafenib. Selinexor exerted marked cell killing of human and murine FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells, including those harboring internal tandem duplication and/or tyrosine kinase domain point mutations. Interestingly, selinexor treatment of murine FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells activated FLT3 and its downstream MAPK or AKT signaling pathways. When combined with sorafenib, selinexor triggered marked synergistic pro-apoptotic effects. This was preceded by elevated nuclear levels of ERK, AKT, NFkappaB, and FOXO3a. Five days of in vitro combination treatment using low doses (i.e., 5 to 10 nM) of each agent promoted early myeloid differentiation of MOLM13 and MOLM14 cells without noticeable cell killing. The combinatorial therapy demonstrated profound in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy in a human FLT3-mutated xenograft model. In an ongoing phase IB clinical trial the selinexor/sorafenib combination induced complete/partial remissions in six of 14 patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia, who had received a median of three prior therapies (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02530476). These results provide pre-clinical and clinical evidence for an effective combinatorial treatment strategy targeting XPO1 and FLT3 in FLT3- mutated acute myeloid leukemias.","['Zhang, Weiguo', 'Ly, Charlie', 'Ishizawa, Jo', 'Mu, Hong', 'Ruvolo, Vivian', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Daver, Naval', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Zhang W', 'Ly C', 'Ishizawa J', 'Mu H', 'Ruvolo V', 'Shacham S', 'Daver N', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA mandreef@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180517,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/pharmacology', '*Karyopherins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mutation', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sorafenib/pharmacology', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.185082 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.185082 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Oct;103(10):1642-1653. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.185082.

Only a small subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients are cured with chemotherapy alone. Relapse in these diseases occurs at least in part due to the failure to eradicate leukemic stem cells or hematopoietic stem cells in myelodysplastic syndrome. CD123, the alpha chain of the interleukin-3 receptor heterodimer, is expressed on the majority of leukemic stem cells and myelodysplastic syndrome hematopoietic stem cells and in 80% of acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we report indiscriminate killing of CD123(+) normal and acute myeloid leukemia / myelodysplastic syndrome cells by SL-401, a diphtheria toxin interleukin-3 fusion protein. SL-401 induced cytotoxicity of CD123(+) primary cells/blasts from acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients but not CD123(-) lymphoid cells. Importantly, SL-401 was highly active even in cells expressing low levels of CD123, with minimal effect on modulation of the CD123 target in acute myeloid leukemia. SL-401 significantly prolonged survival of leukemic mice in acute myeloid leukemia patient-derived xenograft mouse models. In addition to primary samples, studies on normal cord blood and healthy marrow show that SL-401 has activity against normal hematopoietic progenitors. These findings indicate potential use of SL-401 as a ""bridge-to-transplant"" before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia / myelodysplastic syndrome patients.","['Mani, Rajeswaran', 'Goswami, Swagata', 'Gopalakrishnan, Bhavani', 'Ramaswamy, Rahul', 'Wasmuth, Ronni', 'Tran, Minh', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Gordon, Amber', 'Bucci, Donna', 'Lucas, David M', 'Mims, Alice', 'Brooks, Christopher', 'Dorrance, Adrienne', 'Walker, Alison', 'Blum, William', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Mani R', 'Goswami S', 'Gopalakrishnan B', 'Ramaswamy R', 'Wasmuth R', 'Tran M', 'Mo X', 'Gordon A', 'Bucci D', 'Lucas DM', 'Mims A', 'Brooks C', 'Dorrance A', 'Walker A', 'Blum W', 'Byrd JC', 'Lozanski G', 'Vasu S', 'Muthusamy N']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., New York, NY, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA raj.muthusamy@osumc.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180517,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/10/03 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.188193 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.188193 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Aug;103(8):1288-1297. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.188193.

To further characterize the pathological phenotype we performed RNA sequencing of mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia and found a specific molecular signature of genes commonly deregulated in these disorders. Pathway analysis showed a strong enrichment of genes related to osteogenesis, senescence, inflammation and inhibitory cytokines, thereby reflecting the structural and functional deficits of mesenchymal stromal cells in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia on a molecular level. Further analysis identified transforming growth factor beta1 as the most probable extrinsic trigger factor for this altered gene expression. Following exposure to transforming growth factor beta1, healthy mesenchymal stromal cells developed functional deficits and adopted a phenotype reminiscent of that observed in patient-derived stromal cells. These suppressive effects of transforming growth factor beta1 on stromal cell functionality were abrogated by SD-208, an established inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling. Blockade of transforming growth factor beta signaling by SD-208 also restored the osteogenic differentiation capacity of patient-derived stromal cells, thus confirming the role of transforming growth factor beta1 in the bone marrow microenvironment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Our findings establish transforming growth factor beta1 as a relevant trigger causing functional inhibition of mesenchymal stromal cells in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia and identify SD-208 as a candidate to revert these effects.","['Geyh, Stefanie', 'Rodriguez-Paredes, Manuel', 'Jager, Paul', 'Koch, Annemarie', 'Bormann, Felix', 'Gutekunst, Julian', 'Zilkens, Christoph', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Lyko, Frank', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Schroeder, Thomas']","['Geyh S', 'Rodriguez-Paredes M', 'Jager P', 'Koch A', 'Bormann F', 'Gutekunst J', 'Zilkens C', 'Germing U', 'Kobbe G', 'Lyko F', 'Haas R', 'Schroeder T']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf, Medical Faculty, Germany thomas.schroeder@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180517,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Pteridines/pharmacology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.186734 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.186734 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Sep;103(9):1462-1471. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.186734.

Cumulative incidence of on-treatment disease progression/death was similar at years 5 (19%) and 2 (15%); Kaplan-Meier overall survival was 91% at year 2 and 84% at year 5. Of 169 patients who had discontinued bosutinib by year 5, 38 did so after year 2, most commonly for disease progression (n=11). Most adverse events initially occurred within two years. Overall, gastrointestinal events were the most common (diarrhea 86%, nausea 46%, vomiting 37%); the most common grade 3/4 toxicity was thrombocytopenia (25%). None of the 4 on-treatment deaths in years 3-5 were related to bosutinib. Bosutinib demonstrated durable efficacy and manageable toxicity through year 5 confirming its importance in the treatment of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients resistant/intolerant to prior imatinib.

Unfortunately, some patients fail to respond to therapy and many suffer from serious side effects, highlighting the need to investigate other agents to treat this disease. Parthenolide, a nuclear factor kappa (kappa)B inhibitor and reactive oxygen species inducer, has been shown to have excellent anti-cancer activity in pediatric leukemia xenografts, with minimal effects on normal hemopoietic cells. However, some leukemia initiating cell populations remain resistant to parthenolide. This study examined mechanisms for this resistance, including protective effects conferred by bone marrow stromal components. T-cell acute leukemia cells co-cultured with mesenchymal stem cells demonstrated significantly enhanced survival against parthenolide (73+/-11%) compared to cells treated without mesenchymal stem cell support (11+/-9%). Direct cell contact between mesenchymal cells and leukemia cells was not required to afford protection from parthenolide. Mesenchymal stem cells released thiols and protected leukemia cells from reactive oxygen species stress, which is associated with parthenolide cytotoxicity. Blocking cystine uptake by mesenchymal stem cells, using a small molecule inhibitor, prevented thiol release and significantly reduced leukemia cell resistance to parthenolide. These data indicate it may be possible to achieve greater toxicity to childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by combining parthenolide with inhibitors of cystine uptake.","['Ede, Benjamin C', 'Asmaro, Rafal R', 'Moppett, John P', 'Diamanti, Paraskevi', 'Blair, Allison']","['Ede BC', 'Asmaro RR', 'Moppett JP', 'Diamanti P', 'Blair A']","['School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHS Blood and Transplant, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, UK allison.blair@bristol.ac.uk.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHS Blood and Transplant, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180517,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2018/05/19 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.186700 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.186700 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Sep;103(9):1493-1501. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.186700.

We studied how ponatinib is used outside clinical trials in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present retrospective study included all patients with a diagnosis of CML who had received ponatinib in 7 medical centers in Israel. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2016, we identified 37 patients with CML who had received ponatinib, 21 in the chronic phase and 16 in the advanced phase. Only 9 patients (26%) harbored the T315I (threonine to isoleucine mutation at position 315) mutation. All patients had received >/= 1 previous tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The median age in our cohort was 43 years (range, 9-82 years), significantly younger than expected for patients with relapsed or refractory CML and 20 years younger than the median age of patients who participated in the PACE (ponatinib Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and CML evaluation) trial. During a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1-51 months), the overall response rate was 85%. Of 34 patients, 16 (47%) experienced at least a major molecular response. Of the 37 total patients, another 16 patients (43%) discontinued treatment because of disease progression (n = 6), vascular complications (n = 1), severe cytopenia (n = 2), or for other reasons (n = 7). CONCLUSION: In real life, ponatinib is a ""niche-drug"" reserved for a unique population of exceptionally young patients with CML with or without the T315I mutation. In this highly selected group, very different from the PACE cohort, ponatinib achieved high overall response rates.","['Shacham-Abulafia, Adi', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Lavie, David', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Ram, Ron', 'Helman, Ilana', 'Shargian, Liat', 'Gourevitch, Anna', 'Chubar, Evgeni', 'Ratzon, Roy', 'Rozovski, Uri']","['Shacham-Abulafia A', 'Raanani P', 'Lavie D', 'Volchek Y', 'Ram R', 'Helman I', 'Shargian L', 'Gourevitch A', 'Chubar E', 'Ratzon R', 'Rozovski U']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tiqva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tiqva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel; Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tiqva, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Hematology unit, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel; Geha Mental Health Center, Psychiatric Hospital, Petah-Tiqva, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Centre, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Centre, Petah-Tiqva, Israel; Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel.

IDH1 and IDH2 regulate several cellular processes, including oxidative respiration, glutamine metabolism, lipogenesis, and cellular defense against oxidative damage. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been observed in multiple tumors, including gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chondrosarcoma. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations involve a gain in neomorphic activity that catalyzes alphaKG conversion to (R)-2- hydroxyglutarate ((R)-2HG). IDH mutation-mediated accumulation of (R)-2HG results in epigenetic dysregulation, altered gene expression, and a block in cellular differentiation. Targeting mutant IDH by development of small molecule inhibitors is a rapidly emerging therapeutic approach as evidenced by the recent approval of the first selective mutant IDH2 inhibitor AG-221 (enasidenib) for the treatment of IDH2-mutated AML. This review will focus on mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase as a therapeutic drug target and provides an update on selective and pan-mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors in clinical trials and other mutant IDH inhibitors that are under development.","['Sharma, Horrick']",['Sharma H'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Top Med Chem,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biocatalysis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutant Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Glioma', 'Isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'cancer', 'cancer metabolism', 'mIDH inhibitors', 'mutation.']",2018/05/19 06:00,2018/07/19 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CTMC-EPUB-90527 [pii]', '10.2174/1568026618666180518091144 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Med Chem. 2018;18(6):505-524. doi: 10.2174/1568026618666180518091144.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

However, the latest findings have shown that the mode of action of oncogenes is not homogeneous throughout the developmental history of leukemia. Studies on different types of hematopoietic tumors have shown that the contribution of oncogenes to leukemia is mainly mediated through the epigenetic reprogramming of the leukemia-initiating target cell. This driving of cancer by a malignant epigenetic stem cell rewiring is, however, not exclusive of the hematopoietic system, but rather represents a common tumoral mechanism that is also at work in epithelial tumors. Tumoral epigenetic reprogramming is therefore a new type of interaction between genes and their target cells, in which the action of the oncogene modifies the epigenome to prime leukemia development by establishing a new pathological tumoral cellular identity. This reprogramming may remain latent until it is triggered by either endogenous or environmental stimuli. This new view on the making of leukemia not only reveals a novel function for oncogenes, but also provides evidence for a previously unconsidered model of leukemogenesis, in which the programming of the leukemia cellular identity has already occurred at the level of stem cells, therefore showing a role for oncogenes in the timing of leukemia initiation.","['Gonzalez-Herrero, Ines', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez, Guillermo', 'Luengas-Martinez, Andrea', 'Isidro-Hernandez, Marta', 'Jimenez, Rafael', 'Garcia-Cenador, Maria Begona', 'Garcia-Criado, Francisco Javier', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Vicente-Duenas, Carolina']","['Gonzalez-Herrero I', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez G', 'Luengas-Martinez A', 'Isidro-Hernandez M', 'Jimenez R', 'Garcia-Cenador MB', 'Garcia-Criado FJ', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Vicente-Duenas C']","['Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. ighe@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. ighe@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. guillermorh@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. guillermorh@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. andrealuengas@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. andrealuengas@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. martaisidroh@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. martaisidroh@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. rajim@usal.es.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia y Farmacologia, Universidad de Salamanca, Edificio Departamental, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. rajim@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. mbgc@usal.es.', 'Departamento de Cirugia, Universidad de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. mbgc@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. fjgc@usal.es.', 'Departamento de Cirugia, Universidad de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. fjgc@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. isg@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. isg@usal.es.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain. cvd@usal.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180517,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Environment', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogenes']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer therapy', 'leukemia', 'leukemia stem cell', 'mouse model', 'oncogenes', 'reprogramming', 'stem cells']",2018/05/19 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2018/05/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19051494 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19051494 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 May 17;19(5). pii: ijms19051494. doi: 10.3390/ijms19051494.,,,PMC5983781,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8950-8542', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6989-9905', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5401-8295']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated two prognostic indices (PIs) for aggressive ATL, the ATL-PI and Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG)-PI, in a cohort from Okinawa. The PIs were originally developed using two different Japanese cohorts that included few patients from Okinawa. The endpoint was overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox regression analyses in the cohort of 433 patients revealed that all seven factors for calculating each PI were statistically significant prognostic predictors. Three-year OS rates for ATL-PI were 35.9% (low-risk, n = 66), 10.4% (intermediate-risk, n = 256), and 1.6% (high-risk, n = 111), and those for JCOG-PI were 22.4% (moderate-risk, n = 176) and 5.3% (high-risk, n = 257). The JCOG-PI moderate-risk group included both the ATL-PI low- and intermediate-risk groups. ATL-PI more clearly identified the low-risk patient subgroup than JCOG-PI. To evaluate the external validity of the two PIs, we also assessed prognostic discriminability among 159 patients who loosely met the eligibility criteria of a previous clinical trial. Three-year OS rates for ATL-PI were 34.5% (low-risk, n = 42), 9.2% (intermediate-risk, n = 109), and 12.5% (high-risk, n = 8). Those for JCOG-PI were 22.4% (moderate-risk, n = 95) and 7.6% (high-risk, n = 64). The low-risk ATL-PI group had a better prognosis than the JCOG-PI moderate-risk group, suggesting that ATL-PI would be more useful than JCOG-PI for establishing and examining novel treatment strategies for ATL patients with a better prognosis. In addition, strongyloidiasis, previously suggested to be associated with ATL-related deaths in Okinawa, was not a prognostic factor in this study.","['Tamaki, Keita', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Nomura,

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), LSCs frequently express CD34 and often lack CD38. However, little is known about markers and targets expressed in ALL LSCs. We have examined marker- and target expression profiles in CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs in patients with Ph(+) ALL (n=22) and Ph(-) ALL (n=27) by multi-color flow cytometry and qPCR. ALL LSCs expressed CD19 (B4), CD44 (Pgp-1), CD123 (IL-3RA), and CD184 (CXCR4) in all patients tested. Moreover, in various subgroups of patients, LSCs also displayed CD20 (MS4A1) (10/41=24%), CD22 (12/20=60%), CD33 (Siglec-3) (20/48=42%), CD52 (CAMPATH-1) (17/40=43%), IL-1RAP (13/29=45%), and/or CD135 (FLT3) (4/20=20%). CD25 (IL-2RA) and CD26 (DPPIV) were expressed on LSCs in Ph(+) ALL exhibiting BCR/ABL1p210, whereas in Ph(+) ALL with BCR/ABL1p190, LSCs variably expressed CD25 but did not express CD26. In Ph(-) ALL, CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs expressed IL-1RAP in 6/18 patients (33%), but did not express CD25 or CD26. Normal stem cells stained negative for CD25, CD26 and IL-1RAP, and expressed only low amounts of CD52. In xenotransplantation experiments, CD34(+)/CD38(-) and CD34(+)/CD38(+) cells engrafted NSG mice after 12-20 weeks, and targeting with antibodies against CD33 and CD52 resulted in reduced engraftment. Together, LSCs in Ph(+) and Ph(-) ALL display unique marker- and target expression profiles. In Ph(+) ALL with BCR/ABL1p210, the LSC-phenotype closely resembles the marker-profile of CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs in chronic myeloid leukemia, confirming the close biologic relationship of these neoplasms.

However, the relationship between lncRNA MEG3, microRNA-21 (miR-21) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis is unknown. This study examined bone marrow samples from 40CML patients and 10 healthy donors. Proliferation and apoptosis assays, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), bisulfite sequencing PCR, Western blotting, luciferase assay, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed. We found that MEG3 and PTEN expression were down-regulated, whereas, MDM2, DNMT1 and miR-21 were up-regulated in the accelerated and blast phases of CML. Treated with 5-azacytidine decreased the level of MDM2, DNMT1 and miR21, but increased the level of MEG3 and PTEN. Overexpression of MEG3 and silencing the expression of miR-21 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. MEG3 overexpression and silencing the expression of miR21 influence the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, bcl-2 and Bax. MEG3 was able to interact with MDM2 and EZH2. MDM2 could interact with DNMT1 and PTEN. MYC and AKT can interact with EZH2. ChIP-seq showed that the promoter of KLF4 and SFRP2 interacts with DNMT1. In conclusion, lncRNA MEG3 and its target miR21 may serve as novel therapeutic targets for CML blast crisis; and demethylation drugs might also have potential clinical application in treating CML blast crisis.","['Li, Ziye', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Nie, Ziyuan', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Li Z', 'Yang L', 'Liu X', 'Nie Z', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.

The principle toxicity is cytokine release syndrome with resultant hypotension. However, the spectrum of cardiovascular effects associated with CAR T cell therapy has not been systematically evaluated. We reviewed all patients who received CD19-directed CAR T cells at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between April 2012 and September 2016. The primary endpoint was hypotension-requiring inotropic support. Secondary endpoints included echocardiographic dysfunction at discharge and 6-month follow-up. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed, and 98 encounters were included (55% male patients; mean age, 11.8 years [range, 1.7 to 27.1]); 98% had B-ALL. Before infusion 10 had cardiomyopathy and 1 had single-ventricle physiology. Primary endpoint occurred in 24 patients with mean onset 4.6 days (range, 1 to 9) after CAR T cell infusion, including 6 patients receiving milrinone. Worsened systolic function occurred in 10 patients; there were no cardiac-related deaths. Pretreatment factors associated with primary endpoint included higher pretreatment blast percentage on bone marrow biopsy (blast > 25%: odds ratio, 15.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.1 to 47.1; P < .001) and baseline lower ejection fraction (P = .019) or diastolic dysfunction (P = .021); neither pre-existing cardiomyopathy (P = .062), total body irradiation (P = .629), nor anthracycline dose (P = .444) were associated. At discharge, 7 patients had worsened echocardiographic function, but persistent dysfunction by the 6-month follow-up was rare. Pretreatment factors were not associated with persistent dysfunction at discharge. This is the first study to describe the cardiovascular effects of pediatric CAR T cell therapy. Although 10% had new systolic dysfunction after treatment, persistence was rare. Pretreatment blast count > 25% or pre-existing cardiac dysfunction increased the risk for hypotension-requiring inotropic support; these patients may warrant close observation.","['Burstein, Danielle S', 'Maude, Shannon', 'Grupp, Stephen', 'Griffis, Heather', 'Rossano, Joseph', 'Lin, Kimberly']","['Burstein DS', 'Maude S', 'Grupp S', 'Griffis H', 'Rossano J', 'Lin K']","[""Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

A total of 1115 consecutive patients were included in the ALL SCT 2003 BFM study and the ALL SCT 2007 I-BFM study and were stratified according to relapse risk (standard versus high versus very high risk of relapse) and donor type (matched sibling versus matched donor versus mismatched donor). A total of 148 patients (60% boys; median age, 8.7 years; B cell precursor ALL, 75%) were transplanted from mismatched donors, which was defined as either less than 9/10 HLA-compatible donors or less than 5/6 unrelated cord blood after myeloablative conditioning regimen (total body irradiation based, 67%) for high relapse risk (HRR; n = 42) or very HRR (VHRR) disease (n = 106). The stem cell source was either bone marrow (n = 31), unmanipulated peripheral stem cells (n = 28), T cell ex vivo depleted peripheral stem cells (n = 59), or cord blood (n = 25). The median follow-up was 5.1 years. The 4-year rates of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 56% +/- 4% and 52% +/- 4%, respectively, for the entire cohort. Patients transplanted from mismatched donors for HRR disease obtained remarkable 4-year OS and event-free survival values of 82% +/- 6% and 80% +/- 6%, respectively, whereas VHRR patients obtained values of 45% +/- 5% and 42% +/- 5% (P < .001), respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% +/- 4% and that of nonrelapse mortality 19% +/- 3%. The cumulative incidence of limited and extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease was 13% +/- 3% and 15% +/- 4%, respectively, among the 120 patients living beyond day 100. Multivariate analysis showed that OS was lower for transplanted VHRR patients (P = .002; hazard ratio [HR], 3.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 8.20) and for patients beyond second complete remission (CR2) versus first complete remission (P < .001; HR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.79 to 7.56); relapse occurred more frequently in patients with VHRR disease (P = .026; HR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.16 to 9.60) and for those beyond CR2 (P = .005; HR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.52 to 10.59). Nonrelapse mortality was not significantly higher for cytomegalovirus-positive recipients receiving cytomegalovirus-negative grafts (P = .12; HR, 1.96; 95% CI, .84 to 4.58). HSCT with a mismatched donor is feasible in pediatric ALL patients but leads to inferior results compared with HSCT with better matched donors, at least for patients transplanted for VHRR disease. The results are strongly affected by disease status. The main cause of treatment failure is still relapse, highlighting the urgent need for interventional strategies after HSCT for patients with residual leukemia before and/or after transplantation.","['Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Bader, Peter', 'Lankester, Arjan', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Pieczonka, Anna', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Yesilipek, Akif', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Ifversen, Marianne', 'Sufliarska, Sabina', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Glogova, Evgenia', 'Poetschger, Ulrike', 'Peters, Christina']","['Dalle JH', 'Balduzzi A', 'Bader P', 'Lankester A', 'Yaniv I', 'Wachowiak J', 'Pieczonka A', 'Bierings M', 'Yesilipek A', 'Sedlacek P', 'Ifversen M', 'Sufliarska S', 'Toporski J', 'Glogova E', 'Poetschger U', 'Peters C']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hopital Robert Debre and Paris-Diderot University, Paris, France.

Herein, the synthesis, molecular modeling, anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects of ten 2-ethyl and four 2-methoxy analogs of estradiol are reported. The ethyl group was introduced to the steroid A-ring using a novel Friedel-Crafts alkylation protocol. Several analogs displayed potent anti-proliferative activity with IC50-values in the submicromolar range towards the CEM human leukemia cancer cell line. As such, all of these compounds proved to be more active than the lead compound 2-methoxyestradiol (1) in these cells. The six most cytostatic analogs were also tested as anti-angiogenic agents using an in vitro tube formation assay. The IC50-values were determined to be in the range of 0.1muM+/-0.03 and 1.1muM+/-0.2. These six compounds were also modest inhibitors against tubulin polymerization with the most potent inhibitor was 14b (IC50=2.1+/-0.1muM). Binding studies using N,N'-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide) revealed that neither14a or 14b binds to the colchicine binding site in the tubulin protein, in contrast to 2-methoxyestradiol (1). These observations were supported by molecular modeling studies.

To investigate the role of CK2alpha in cell proliferation and apoptosis of malignant lymphomas and leukemia, 2 lymphoma cell lines and one leukemia cell line were infected with CK2alpha shRNA lentivirus or negative control shRNA lentivirus, and stably infected cell lines were established. Real-time PCR and Western blot results showed that the mRNA and protein levels of CK2alpha were significantly reduced in CK2alpha knockdown cells. The tetrazolium-based colorimetric (MTT) assay found that down-regulation of CK2alpha inhibited the proliferation of these cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that inhibition of CK2alpha induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of lymphoma and leukemia cells. In accordance with these, down-regulation of CK2alpha also reduced the protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclinD1, and bcl-2, and increased the protein expression of bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, knockdown of CK2alpha impeded the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. In summary, our study revealed that CK2alpha may contribute to the development of malignant lymphoma and leukemia, and serve as the therapeutic target of these malignant tumors.","['Jiang, Li', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Hu, Naifeng', 'Liu, Aichun', 'Zhu, Hailong', 'Li, Lianqiao', 'Tian, Yuyang', 'Chen, Xue', 'Quan, Lina']","['Jiang L', 'Zhang J', 'Hu N', 'Liu A', 'Zhu H', 'Li L', 'Tian Y', 'Chen X', 'Quan L']","[""a Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150080, People's Republic of China."", ""b Department of Internal Medicine, Harbin Fourth Hospital, Harbin 150026, People's Republic of China."", ""c Department of Internal Medicine, Forest Industry General Hospital of Heilongjiang Province, Harbin 150040, People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150080, People's Republic of China."", ""d School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Harbin Normal University, Harbin 150086, People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150080, People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150080, People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150080, People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin 150080, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180517,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Casein Kinase II/deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CK2alpha', '*apoptose', '*apoptosis', '*lymphome malin', '*malignant lymphoma', '*proliferation', '*proliferation', '*xenografts', '*xenogreffe']",2018/05/18 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/bcb-2017-0345 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2018 Dec;96(6):786-796. doi: 10.1139/bcb-2017-0345.

We examined the influence of family cohesion, parent distress, and overprotection on child symptom burden and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and family strain in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Parents of 213 children treated with chemotherapy only completed a survey when survivors were at least 5-year postdiagnosis. Family Environment Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Parent Protection Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Impact on Family were used to assess family cohesion, parental distress, overprotection, child symptom burden and HRQOL, and family strain, respectively. Path analysis was conducted to quantify effects of family cohesion on family strain through parental distress, overprotection, child symptoms, and HRQOL. RESULTS: Lower family cohesion (beta = 0.06, 95% CI, 0.01-0.13), higher parental distress (beta = 0.35, 95% CI, 0.20-0.45), and overprotection (beta = 0.17, 95% CI, 0.01-0.32) were associated with more child symptom burden. More symptom burden were associated with poorer child HRQOL (beta = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.57-0.75), which in turn was associated with more family strain (beta = 0.11, 95% CI, 0.01-0.22). Lower maternal education was associated with overprotection (beta = -0.23, 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.12), more child symptoms (beta = -0.30, 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.16), poorer child HRQOL (beta = -0.36, 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.21), and more family strain (beta = -0.15, 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Family and parental factors contributed to health outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors. Interventions to enhance family cohesion, decrease parental distress and overprotection, and ameliorate child symptoms may improve family functioning.","['Huang, I-Chan', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Mullins, Larry', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Huang IC', 'Brinkman TM', 'Mullins L', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180629,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior/*psychology', 'Adult', 'Behavioral Symptoms/*psychology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child Behavior/*psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*family strain', '*overprotection', '*parental distress', '*quality of life', '*symptoms']",2018/05/18 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4769 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2018 Aug;27(8):2031-2038. doi: 10.1002/pon.4769.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis was performed in 112 newly-diagnosed patients with APL during induction treatment. RESULTS The early death (ED) rate in our study was 5.36% and the main cause was fetal hemorrhage. The presence of bleeding symptoms was significantly correlated with low platelet and fibrinogen levels. The values of white blood cell (WBC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, and bone marrow leukemic promyelocyte in the high-risk group were significantly different from those in the low/intermediate-risk groups. Coagulation variables significantly improved after dual induction therapy. No significant difference was found in changes of platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimers, and fibrinogen among different risk groups after induction therapy. D-dimer levels were initially high and remained well above normal after 4 weeks of induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS Aggressive prophylactic transfusion to maintain high platelet and fibrinogen transfusion thresholds could reduce hemorrhage in APL patients. Immediately starting induction therapy effectively alleviated coagulopathy in APL patients. Hyperfibrinolysis was a more important event in the APL hemorrhagic diathesis.","['Song, Yu-Hua', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Xiao, Li-Chan', 'Zhang, Run', 'Lu, Hua -']","['Song YH', 'Qiao C', 'Xiao LC', 'Zhang R', 'Lu H-']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, , China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180517,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', '*Fibrinolysis/drug effects', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Hemostatics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/18 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['909938 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.909938 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2018 May 17;24:3249-3255. doi: 10.12659/MSM.909938.,['0 (Hemostatics)'],,PMC5985706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current retrospective study assessed the incidence of concurrent vincristine and azole antifungal usage to determine if it led to increased neurotoxicity for the Kaiser Northern California pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin lymphoma patient population. Data were obtained from the electronic medical record (2007 to 2014). In total, 130 subjects received at least one dose of vincristine for ALL or Hodgkin lymphoma (median age 9, 88% ALL, 58% male, 47% Caucasian). Thirty one percent of patients received concurrent antifungal usage (fluconazole, 78%; voriconazole, 10%; fluconazole/voriconazole, 12%); however, concurrent antifungal usage accounted for <15% of vincristine doses. Grade 2 or greater neuropathy occurred in 51% of patients; grade 3 neuropathy was present in 8% of patients. No difference in the incidence of grade 2 or greater neuropathy was observed with the concurrent use of antifungal therapy (P=0.35), sex (P=0.59), type of cancer (P=0.41), ethnicity (P=0.29), or age (P=0.39), but was higher with increasing amount of vincristine doses (P=0.004).

Breathing difficulty may occur after the insertion of a nasogastric tube and it can have multiple causes. Here we discuss 2 patients of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed a rare condition called the Sofferman syndrome (nasogastric tube syndrome). We will also briefly outline a diagnostic algorithm to facilitate its fast and correct diagnosis. METHODS: We present 2 cases of pediatric ALL who were undergoing chemotherapy in the pediatrics department. They presented with respiratory distress and stridor within a few days of nasogastric tube insertion. RESULTS: Two cases of ALL developed stridor within 48 hours of nasogastric tube insertion. The stridor gradually progressed over days. Both the patients required tracheostomy to secure the airway. Removal of the nasogastric tube did not reverse the airway obstruction. CONCLUSION: Nasogastric tube syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition and has to be considered as a possibility in immune-compromised patients who present with voice change and stridor after nasogastric tube insertion.,"['Nayak, Gyanaranjan', 'Virk, Ramandeep S', 'Singh, Manvi', 'Singh, Meenu']","['Nayak G', 'Virk RS', 'Singh M', 'Singh M']","['Departments of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Departments of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Pediatric Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Pediatric Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Bronchology Interv Pulmonol,Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,101496866,IM,"['Bronchoscopy/methods', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Epiglottis/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intubation, Gastrointestinal/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Respiratory Sounds/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Tracheostomy/methods', 'Ulcer/diagnostic imaging/pathology']",,,2018/05/18 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/LBR.0000000000000507 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bronchology Interv Pulmonol. 2018 Oct;25(4):343-345. doi: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000507.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An economic evaluation is needed to understand the potential costs and benefits of delivering adherence-promotion interventions (APIs) as part of standard clinical care. Methods: A Markov decision analytic model was used to simulate the potential incremental cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be gained from an API for children with B-ALL in first continuous remission compared with treatment as usual (TAU, no intervention). Model parameter estimates were informed by previously published studies. The primary outcome was incremental cost (2015 US$) per QALY gained for API compared with TAU. Results: The model predicts the API to result in superior health outcomes (4.87 vs. 4.86 QALYs) and cost savings ($43,540.73 vs. $46,675.71) as compared with TAU, and simulations indicate that, across a range of plausible parameter estimates, there is a 95% chance that the API is more effective and less costly than TAU.

Hence the objective of this work is to construct optimized nanosized malleable liposomes of cytarabine to accentuate transdermal delivery of drug to circumvent previously mentioned drawbacks. We also investigated its characteristics and therapeutic efficiency and attempted to systematically explore the penetration enhancing property. Well characterized ethanolic liposomes were also biologically tested for dermatological safety and systemic bioavailability. Ethanolic liposomes were found to be spherical having nanometric size with low polydispersity and high encapsulation efficiency. Skin permeation and deposition studies revealed significant enhancement. In vivo, skin irritation study of developed formulation showed no erythema or scaling vis-a-vis the liposomes. Blood profile of this novel formulation indicated lower lag time with the high amount of drug within 3-12 h after transdermal administration demonstrating the enhanced percutaneous penetration of cytarabine with no erythema, thus leading to patient's compliance by alternative delivery of drug for the treatment of leukemia.","['Raj, Rakesh', 'Raj, Pooja Mongia', 'Ram, Alpana']","['Raj R', 'Raj PM', 'Ram A']","['a Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya (A Central University) , Bilaspur , C.G. , India.', 'a Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya (A Central University) , Bilaspur , C.G. , India.', 'a Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya (A Central University) , Bilaspur , C.G. , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180517,England,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",101594777,IM,"['Administration, Cutaneous', 'Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Compounding', 'Ethanol/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/adverse effects/*chemistry', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Permeability', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Skin/drug effects/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Malleable liposomes', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytarabine', 'dermatological safety', 'ethosomes', 'transdermal delivery']",2018/05/18 06:00,2019/06/19 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21691401.2018.1473414 [doi]'],ppublish,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol. 2018;46(sup2):951-963. doi: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1473414.

Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in USB1 gene are detected in all molecularly tested patients but genotype-phenotype correlation remains elusive. Cancer predisposition is recognized among PN features and pathogenic variants found in patients who developed early in life myelodysplasia (n = 12), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2), and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2) should be kept into account in management and follow-up of novel patients. This will hopefully allow achieving data clustered on specific mutations relevant to oncological surveillance of the carrier patients. METHODS: We describe the clinical features of three unreported PN patients and characterize their USB1 pathogenic variants by transcript analysis to get insights into the effect on the overall phenotype and disease evolution. RESULTS: A Turkish boy is homozygous for the c.531delA deletion, a recurrent mutation in Turkey; an adult Italian male is compound heterozygous for two nonsense mutations, c.243G>A and c.541C>T, while an Italian boy is homozygous for the splicing c.683_693+1del variant. The identified mutations have already been reported in PN patients who developed hematologic or skin cancer. Aberrant mRNAs of all four mutated alleles could be identified confirming that transcripts of USB1 main isoform either carrying stop codons or mis-spliced may at least partially escape nonsense-mediated decay. CONCLUSIONS: Our study addresses the need of gathering insights on genotype-phenotype correlations in newly described PN patients, by transcript analysis and information on disease evolution of reported patients with the same pathogenic variants.","['Colombo, Elisa A', 'Elcioglu, Nursel H', 'Graziano, Claudio', 'Farinelli, Pamela', 'Di Fede, Elisabetta', 'Neri, Iria', 'Facchini, Elena', 'Greco, Mariangela', 'Gervasini, Cristina', 'Larizza, Lidia']","['Colombo EA', 'Elcioglu NH', 'Graziano C', 'Farinelli P', 'Di Fede E', 'Neri I', 'Facchini E', 'Greco M', 'Gervasini C', 'Larizza L']","['Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, via Antonio di Rudini 8, 20142, Milan, Italy. elisaadele.colombo@unimi.it.', 'Department of Pediatric Genetics, Marmara University Medical School, 34890, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Genetics, Turkey and Eastern Mediterranean University, Cyprus, 10, Mersin, Turkey.', 'U.O.

Enasidenib targets cells with mutant copies of isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), inhibiting the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarte (2-HG) formed by the mutant IDH2. Areas covered: We review the studies leading to enasidenib's approval, as well as common side effects and safety issues experienced during the clinical trials. There is a focus on the diagnosis and treatment of these side effects including differentiation syndrome. Expert commentary: We are experiencing a revolution in the understanding of the mechanism of AML. A majority of the effort has been concentrated on targeting gene mutations or pathway activations with precision therapeutics. Enasidenib is beneficial in a patient population that previously had limited treatment options. However, given the fact that enasidenib is a highly specific inhibitor of an early stable mutation, it is questionable whether a strategy of targeting a single mutation or pathway in relapsed AML will allow for better than the 20% complete remission (CR) rate observed with this therapy. The proper role for single mutation targeting in AML needs to be carefully considered.","['Dugan, James', 'Pollyea, Daniel']","['Dugan J', 'Pollyea D']","['a Division of Hematology , University of Colorado School of Medicine , Aurora , CO , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology , University of Colorado School of Medicine , Aurora , CO , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180724,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,IM,"['Adult', 'Aminopyridines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Triazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'IDH2', 'differentiation syndrome', 'enasidenib', 'leukemia']",2018/05/18 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2018.1477585 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2018 Aug;11(8):755-760. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2018.1477585.

It is typically performed by a trained hematopathologist through visual examination of bidimensional plots, making the analysis time-consuming and sometimes too subjective. Here, a pilot study applying genetic algorithms to flow cytometry data from normal and acute myeloid leukemia subjects is described. Subjects and Methods: Initially, Flow Cytometry Standard files from 316 normal and 43 acute myeloid leukemia subjects were transformed into multidimensional FITS image metafiles. Training was performed through introduction of FITS metafiles from 4 normal and 4 acute myeloid leukemia in the artificial intelligence system. Results: Two mathematical algorithms termed 018330 and 025886 were generated. When tested against a cohort of 312 normal and 39 acute myeloid leukemia subjects, both algorithms combined showed high discriminatory power with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.912.

In both humans and mice, TET2 deficiency leads to increased self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells with a net developmental bias towards the myeloid lineage(1,4,8,9). However, pre-leukaemic myeloproliferation (PMP) occurs in only a fraction of Tet2(-/-) mice(8,9) and humans with TET2 mutations(1,3,5-7), suggesting that extrinsic non-cell-autonomous factors are required for disease onset. Here we show that bacterial translocation and increased interleukin-6 production, resulting from dysfunction of the small-intestinal barrier, are critical for the development of PMP in mice that lack Tet2 expression in haematopoietic cells. Furthermore, in symptom-free Tet2(-/-) mice, PMP can be induced by disrupting intestinal barrier integrity, or in response to systemic bacterial stimuli such as the toll-like receptor 2 agonist. PMP was reversed by antibiotic treatment and failed to develop in germ-free Tet2(-/-) mice, which illustrates the importance of microbial signals in the development of this condition. Our findings demonstrate the requirement for microbial-dependent inflammation in the development of PMP and provide a mechanistic basis for the variation in PMP penetrance observed in Tet2(-/-) mice. This study will prompt new lines of investigation that may profoundly affect the prevention and management of haematopoietic malignancies.","['Meisel, Marlies', 'Hinterleitner, Reinhard', 'Pacis,

The predictive factors and timing of relapse in patients with U-MRD and value of interim MRD analysis are ill-defined. This was a prospective study of 289 patients with CLL treated first-line with FCR. MRD analysis was performed after course 3 (C3) and at end of therapy (EOT) in bone marrow using 4-color flow cytometry (sensitivity 10(-4)). Eighteen percent of patients had U-MRD after C3 and 48% at EOT. U-MRD status at EOT was associated with longer PFS (median NR vs 38 mo, p < 0.001). MRD level (</=1% vs >1%) after C3 predicted greater likelihood of U-MRD status at EOT (64% vs 9%, p < 0.001). PFS was significantly longer for patients with MRD </=1% vs >1% after C3 (median 73 mo vs 41 mo, p < 0.001), but similar for <0.01% vs 0.01-1%. Interim MRD status may therefore be used for risk stratification and to individualize therapy. Eighty-five patients with U-MRD status at EOT had yearly blood MRD monitoring; MRD re-emerged in 38/85, a median of 48 mo after EOT and preceded clinical progression by a median of 24 months, which may allow development of early intervention strategies.","['Thompson, Philip A', 'Peterson, Christine B', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Jorgensen, Jeff', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Daver, Naval', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Wierda, William G']","['Thompson PA', 'Peterson CB', 'Strati P', 'Jorgensen J', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Ferrajoli A', 'Burger JA', 'Estrov Z', 'Jain N', 'Kadia TM', 'Borthakur G', 'DiNardo CD', 'Daver N', 'Jabbour E', 'Wierda WG']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'The Chao Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180417,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2018/05/18 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2017/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0132-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0132-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Nov;32(11):2388-2398. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0132-y.

To remove experimental variation, expression levels of the gene of interest are typically normalized to the expression level of stably expressed endogenous reference genes. Identifying suitable reference genes and determining the optimal number of reference genes should precede each quantification study. Popular reference genes are not necessarily stably expressed in the examined conditions, possibly leading to inaccurate results. Stably and universally expressed repetitive elements (ERE) have previously been shown to be an excellent alternative for normalization using classic reference genes in human and zebrafish samples. Here, we confirm that in mouse tissues, EREs are broadly applicable reference targets for RT-qPCR normalization, provided that the RNA samples undergo a thorough DNase treatment. We identified Orr1a0, Rltr2aiap, and Rltr13a3 as the most stably expressed mouse EREs across six different experimental conditions. Therefore, we propose this set of ERE reference targets as good candidates for normalization of RT-qPCR data in a plethora of conditions. The identification of widely applicable stable mouse RT-qPCR reference targets for normalization has great potential to facilitate future murine gene expression studies and improve the validity of RT-qPCR data.","['Renard, Marjolijn', 'Vanhauwaert, Suzanne', 'Vanhomwegen, Marine', 'Rihani, Ali', 'Vandamme, Niels', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Berx, Geert', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Haigh, Jody J', 'Decaesteker, Bieke', 'Van Laere, Jolien', 'Lambertz, Irina', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Vandesompele, Jo', 'Willaert, Andy']","['Renard M', 'Vanhauwaert S', 'Vanhomwegen M', 'Rihani A', 'Vandamme N', 'Goossens S', 'Berx G', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Haigh JJ', 'Decaesteker B', 'Van Laere J', 'Lambertz I', 'Speleman F', 'Vandesompele J', 'Willaert A']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Lab, Inflammation Research Center, VIB, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Lab, Inflammation Research Center, VIB, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Lab, Inflammation Research Center, VIB, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Mammalian Functional Genetics Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. andy.willaert@ugent.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180516,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities/*genetics/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Reference Standards', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*standards', 'Skin Diseases/*genetics/pathology', 'Zebrafish/metabolism']",,,2018/05/18 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2016/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-25389-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-25389-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 May 16;8(1):7642. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-25389-6.,,,PMC5955877,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6176-0519', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9063-7205', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6274-0184']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the ability of IV in-line filters to eliminate particulate matter from multidrug infusion lines and so prevent contamination. The impact on particle occurrence of the internal volume of the IV line below the in-line filter was then evaluated. The multidrug therapy given to children was reproduced with and without in-line filtration. Three combinations with a filter were tested to vary the internal volume (V) between the filter and the catheter egress. The catheter was then connected to a dynamic particle count to evaluate the particulate matter potentially administered to children during infusion. The introduction of in-line filters led to a significant reduction in overall particulate matter, from 416,974 [208,479-880,229] to 7,551 [1,985-11,287] particles (p < 0.001). Larger particles of >/=10 and 25 microm were also significantly reduced. Adding an extension set to the egress of the in-line filter (V = 1.7 mL) caused a significant increase in particulate contamination for both. This study showed that in-line filtration is an effective tool in preventing particle administration to patients.

ATL cells often exhibit random gross chromosomal rearrangements that are associated with the induction and improper repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). The viral oncoprotein Tax has been reported to impair DSB repair but has not been shown to be consistently expressed throughout all phases of infection. The viral oncoprotein HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ) is consistently expressed prior to and throughout disease progression, but it is unclear whether it also influences DSB repair. We report that HBZ attenuates DSB repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in a manner dependent upon the bZIP domain. HBZ was found to interact with two vital members of the NHEJ core machinery, Ku70 and Ku80, and to be recruited to DSBs in a bZIP-dependent manner in vitro We observed that HBZ expression also resulted in a bZIP-dependent delay in DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK) activation following treatment with etoposide. Although Tax is reported to interact with Ku70, we did not find Tax expression to interfere with HBZ:Ku complex formation. However, as Tax was reported to saturate NHEJ, we found that this effect masked the attenuation of NHEJ by HBZ. Overall, these data suggest that DSB repair mechanisms are impaired not only by Tax but also by HBZ and show that HBZ expression may significantly contribute to the accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities during HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis.IMPORTANCE Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects 15 million to 20 million people worldwide. Approximately 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic and may remain undiagnosed, increasing the risk that they will unknowingly transmit the virus. About 5% of the HTLV-1-positive population develop adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a fatal disease that is not highly responsive to treatment. Although ATL development remains poorly understood, two viral proteins, Tax and HBZ, have been implicated in driving disease progression by manipulating host cell signaling and transcriptional pathways. Unlike Tax, HBZ expression is consistently observed in all infected individuals, making it important to elucidate the specific role of HBZ in disease progression. Here, we present evidence that HBZ could promote the accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) through the attenuation of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. This effect may lead to genome instability, ultimately contributing to the development of ATL.","['Rushing, Amanda W', 'Hoang, Kimson', 'Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Rushing AW', 'Hoang K', 'Polakowski N', 'Lemasson I']","['Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA rushinga18@ecu.edu lemassoni@ecu.edu.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA rushinga18@ecu.edu lemassoni@ecu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180717,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA End-Joining Repair', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HBZ', '*NHEJ', '*Tax', '*human T cell leukemia virus', '*leukemia', '*viral oncogene']",2018/05/18 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00672-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00672-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Jul 17;92(15). pii: JVI.00672-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00672-18.

Because of the difficulties of generating conformational mAbs against complex and highly conserved membrane proteins, no reliable tools exist to measure GLUT4 at the cell surface, follow its trafficking, or detect the conformational state of the protein. Here we report the isolation and characterization of conformational mAbs that recognize the extracellular and intracellular domains of GLUT4, including mAbs that are specific for the inward-open and outward-open states of GLUT4. mAbs against GLUT4 were generated using virus-like particles to present this complex membrane protein in its native conformation and using a divergent host species (chicken) for immunization to overcome immune tolerance. As a result, the isolated mAbs recognize conformational epitopes on native GLUT4 in cells, with apparent affinities as high as 1 pM and with specificity for GLUT4 across the human membrane proteome. Epitope mapping using shotgun mutagenesis alanine scanning across the 509 amino acids of GLUT4 identified the binding epitopes for mAbs specific for the states of GLUT4 and allowed the comprehensive identification of the residues that functionally control the GLUT4 inward-open and outward-open states. The mAbs identified here will be valuable molecular tools for monitoring GLUT4 structure, function, and trafficking, for differentiating GLUT4 conformational states, and for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes.","['Tucker, David F', 'Sullivan, Jonathan T', 'Mattia, Kimberly-Anne', 'Fisher, Christine R', 'Barnes, Trevor', 'Mabila, Manu N', 'Wilf, Rona', 'Sulli, Chidananda', 'Pitts, Meghan', 'Payne, Riley J', 'Hall, Moniquetta', 'Huston-Paterson, Duncan', 'Deng, Xiaoxiang', 'Davidson, Edgar', 'Willis, Sharon H', 'Doranz, Benjamin J', 'Chambers, Ross', 'Rucker, Joseph B']","['Tucker DF', 'Sullivan JT', 'Mattia KA', 'Fisher CR', 'Barnes T', 'Mabila MN', 'Wilf R', 'Sulli C', 'Pitts M', 'Payne RJ', 'Hall M', 'Huston-Paterson D', 'Deng X', 'Davidson E', 'Willis SH', 'Doranz BJ', 'Chambers R', 'Rucker JB']","['Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA 19104 jrucker@integralmolecular.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180516,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Domains', 'Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle/chemistry/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GLUT4', '*chicken', '*lipoparticles', '*monoclonal antibody', '*phage display']",2018/05/18 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['1716788115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1716788115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 May 29;115(22):E4990-E4999. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1716788115.

This heterogeneous course is related, in part, to the different biological characteristics of conventional MCL (cMCL) and the distinct subgroup of leukemic nonnodal MCL (nnMCL). Robust criteria to distinguish these MCL subtypes and additional biological parameters that influence their evolution are not well defined. We describe a novel molecular assay that reliably distinguishes cMCL and nnMCL using blood samples. We trained a 16-gene assay (L-MCL16 assay) on the NanoString platform using 19 purified leukemic samples. The locked assay was applied to an independent cohort of 70 MCL patients with leukemic presentation. The assay assigned 37% of cases to nnMCL and 56% to cMCL. nnMCL and cMCL differed in nodal presentation, lactate dehydrogenase, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene mutational status, management options, genomic complexity, and CDKN2A/ATM deletions, but the proportion with 17p/TP53 aberrations was similar in both subgroups. Sequential samples showed that assay prediction was stable over time. nnMCL had a better overall survival (OS) than cMCL (3-year OS 92% vs 69%; P = .006) from the time of diagnosis and longer time to first treatment. Genomic complexity and TP53/CDKN2A aberrations predicted for shorter OS in the entire series and cMCL, whereas only genomic complexity was associated with shorter time to first treatment and OS in nnMCL. In conclusion, the newly developed assay robustly recognizes the 2 molecular subtypes of MCL in leukemic samples. Its combination with genetic alterations improves the prognostic evaluation and may provide useful biological information for management decisions.","['Clot, Guillem', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Gine, Eva', 'Navarro, Alba', 'Royo, Cristina', 'Pinyol, Magda', 'Martin-Garcia, David', 'Demajo, Santiago', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Salar, Antonio', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Muntanola, Ana', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Rauert-Wunderlich, Hilka', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Ott, German', 'Wright, George W', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Scott, David W', 'Rimsza, Lisa M', 'Bea, Silvia', 'Campo, Elias']","['Clot G', 'Jares P', 'Gine E', 'Navarro A', 'Royo C', 'Pinyol M', 'Martin-Garcia D', 'Demajo S', 'Espinet B', 'Salar A', 'Ferrer A', 'Muntanola A', 'Aymerich M', 'Rauert-Wunderlich H', 'Jaffe ES', 'Connors JM', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Delabie J', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Ott G', 'Wright GW', 'Staudt LM', 'Rosenwald A', 'Scott DW', 'Rimsza LM', 'Bea S', 'Campo E']","['Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit-Laboratory of Pathology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pathology Department and.', 'Hematology Department, IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Servei d'Hematologia, Hospital Mutua de Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit-Laboratory of Pathology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus and Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany;

In its inorganic form, arsenic is highly toxic and carcinogenic and is widely found across the globe and throughout the environment. As an International Agency for Research on Cancer-defined class 1 human carcinogen, arsenic can cause multiple human cancers, including liver, lung, urinary bladder, skin, kidney, and prostate. Mechanisms of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis remain elusive, and this review focuses specifically on the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in promoting cancer development. In addition to exerting potent carcinogenic responses, arsenic is also known for its therapeutic effects against acute promyelocytic leukemia. Current literature suggests that arsenic can achieve both therapeutic as well as carcinogenic effects, and this review serves to examine the paradoxical effects of arsenic, specifically through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of current literature reveals an imperative need for future studies to establish and pinpoint the exact conditions for which arsenic can, and through what mechanisms it is able to, differentially regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to maximize the therapeutic and minimize the carcinogenic properties of arsenic.","['Chen, Qiao Yi', 'Costa, Max']","['Chen QY', 'Costa M']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, Tuxedo, New York.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, Tuxedo, New York Max.Costa@nyumc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20180516,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2018/05/18 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2018/05/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['mol.118.112268 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.118.112268 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2018 Jul;94(1):784-792. doi: 10.1124/mol.118.112268.

Use of haploidentical (mismatched) donors increases HSCT availability but is limited by severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and delayed immune reconstitution. Alloanergization of donor T cells is a simple approach to rebuild immunity while limiting GvHD after haploidentical HSCT, but the optimal T-cell dose and impact on immune reconstitution remain unknown.Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter phase I trial of alloanergized donor lymphocyte infusion (aDLI) after CD34-selected myeloablative haploidentical HSCT. The primary aim was feasibility and safety with secondary aims of assessing the less frequently addressed issue of impact on immune reconstitution.Results: Nineteen patients with high-risk acute leukemia or myelodysplasia were enrolled. Engraftment occurred in 18 of 19 patients (95%). Pre-aDLI, 12 patients (63%) had bacteremia, nine of 17 at-risk patients (53%) reactivated CMV, and one developed acute GvHD. Sixteen patients received aDLI at dose levels 1 (10(3) T cells/kg, n = 4), 2 (10(4), n = 8), and 3 (10(5), n = 4). After aDLI, five patients developed clinically significant acute GvHD, and four of 14 at-risk patients (29%) reactivated CMV. T-cell recovery was significantly greater, and functional virus- and tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells were detectable earlier in patients receiving dose level 2 or 3 versus dose level 1/no aDLI. Alloanergization of donor cells expanded the CD4(+) T-regulatory cell frequency within aDLI, which increased further in vivo without impeding expansion of virus- and tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells.Conclusions: These data demonstrate safety and a potential role for aDLI in contributing to immune reconstitution and expanding tolerogenic regulatory T cells in vivo after CD34-selected myeloablative haploidentical HSCT.

A large percentage of patients succumb to this disease in spite of aggressive treatments with chemotherapy. Recent advances with mutational analysis led to the discovery of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in AML. IDH2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate; its mutated version leads to the accumulation of the oncometabolite (R)-2 hydroxyglutarate, which disrupts several cell processes and leads to a blockage in differentiation. Targeting IDH2 is compelling, as it is an early and stable mutation in AML. Enasidenib, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of IDH2, recently gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory IDH2-mutated AML.

Type 17 T cells, controlled transcriptionally by RORgamma, have been reported to mediate potent antitumor effects superior to those observed with conventionally expanded T cells. Here, we demonstrate that addition of a synthetic, small-molecule RORgamma agonist during ex vivo expansion potentiates the antitumor activity of human Th17 and Tc17 cells redirected with a CAR. Likewise, ex vivo use of this agonist bolstered the antitumor properties of murine tumor-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Expansion in the presence of the RORgamma agonist enhanced IL17A production without compromising IFNgamma secretion in vitroIn vivo, cytokine neutralization studies revealed that IFNgamma and IL17A were required to regress murine melanoma tumors. The enhanced antitumor effect of RORgamma agonist treatment was associated with recovery of more donor T cells in the tumor and spleen; these cells produced elevated levels of cytokines months after infusion and expressed markers of long-lived stem and central memory cells such as Tcf7 and CD62L. Conversely, untreated cells mainly exhibited effector phenotypes in the tumor. Cured mice previously treated with agonist-primed T cells were protected from tumor rechallenge. Collectively, our work reveals that in vitro treatment with a RORgamma agonist generates potent antitumor Type 17 effector cells that persist as long-lived memory cells in vivoSignificance: RORgamma agonists can be used in vitro during T-cell expansion to enhance the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy (e.g., CAR-T) and to provide long-term protection against tumors.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/14/3888/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(14); 3888-98.

Traditional therapy was based on that regimens used for closely related entities, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma. This resulted in a lack of drugs specifically approved for WM, until the discovery of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: Two main therapeutic attitudes are possible: (1) conventional therapies based on combinations with alkylating agents or proteasome inhibitors with steroids and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or (2) new approaches with BTK inhibitors, usually alone. Other possibilities such as BCL2 inhibitors, PI3K/AKT inhibitors, and others are currently under evaluation, but we will focus the review on the most consolidated approaches that are available for patients with WM at different stages of the disease. PubMed, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov were queried for the keywords 'Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia' and the different drugs here evaluated through 1 February 2018.

We evaluated whether high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) can be administered safely with extended hydration and leucovorin rescue, with monitoring of serum creatinine and urine pH. METHODS: The prospective study was conducted at a single centre in Chandigarh, India in 2015. Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or with T-cell ALL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) were administered 3 and 5 gm/m(2) of MTX (24 hr infusion), respectively. Six doses of leucovorin (15 mg/m(2) /dose), instead of recommended three (for optimally reduced levels) at standard timing (42 hr from start of HD-MTX) were administered. Hydration (125 ml/m(2) /hr) was continued for 72 hr, instead of the recommended 30 hr. Hydration fluid consisted of 0.45% sodium chloride, 5% dextrose, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (50 mmol/l) and potassium chloride (20 mmol/l). Serum creatinine and urine pH were measured at baseline, 24 and 48 hr. The volume of hydration was increased (200 ml/m(2) /hr) for a serum creatinine > 1.25 times the baseline. RESULTS: The study included 100 cycles of HD-MTX in 53 patients: B-ALL 25 patients (51 cycles), T-ALL 16 patients (28 cycles), T-NHL 10 patients (18 cycles), and relapsed ALL 2 patients (3 cycles). The mean age was 6.8 +/- 3.2 years. Patients were underweight in 15 (15%) cycles. Patients in 23% of cycles had a rise in creatinine to >1.25 times the baseline. Toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4.0) included mucositis (32%), diarrhoea (10%), and febrile neutropenia (9%). One patient died from dengue shock syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: It is safe to administer 3 or 5 gm/m(2) of MTX (24 hr infusion) without measuring MTX levels, with extended hydration, additional doses of leucovorin, and monitoring of serum creatinine and urine pH.","['Vaishnavi, Kalthi', 'Bansal, Deepak', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Jain, Richa', 'Attri, Savita Verma']","['Vaishnavi K', 'Bansal D', 'Trehan A', 'Jain R', 'Attri SV']","['Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Biochemistry Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20180516,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/urine', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*folinic acid', '*high-dose methotrexate', '*leukemia', '*low-middle income country', '*renal toxicity']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27241 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Dec;65(12):e27241. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27241.

B-BLB in adults with brain metastases is extremely rare as the disease mainly affects children and adults. Therefore, such a seldom-seen case can easily trigger a dispute regarding clinical diagnosis and treatment.This paper reports the case of a 22-year-old man hospitalized for a head injury that resulted from a physical altercation. Upon admission to the hospital, the patient was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Accordingly, the patient receiving follow-up treatments, but died 30 days later. After a systematic necropsy, immunohistochemical staining, radiological consultation, and a complete review of the clinical dates, we defined the case as a brain metastasis of B lymphoblastic lymphoma. Imaging results of the intracranial lymphoma were nearly indistinguishable from DAI during the acute phase, which led to misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment for B-LBL. CONCLUSION: We present this case to broaden the scope of pathologic and clinical diagnosis for intracranial tumors and to inform physicians, general neurologists, and even medical examiners with an added degree of differential awareness in dealing with the clinical materials before further diacrisis and disposal.","['Shi, Jian', 'Manzo, Jale', 'Zhou, Yiwu', 'Agovino, Peter', 'Wu, Song']","['Shi J', 'Manzo J', 'Zhou Y', 'Agovino P', 'Wu S']","['The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China Clinical and Translational Science Center, Weill Medical College, Cornell University, New York Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China Teachers College, Columbia University, New York.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/secondary', 'Craniocerebral Trauma/complications/*diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diffuse Axonal Injury/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",,,2018/05/17 06:00,2018/05/26 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000010695 [doi]', '00005792-201805180-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 May;97(20):e10695. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010695.,,,PMC5976327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) is one of the first drugs used in ALL treatment. Anti-tumor activity of L-ASNase is not specific and indicates limited stability in different biological environments, in addition to its quick clearance from blood. The purpose of the present study was to achieve a new L-ASNase polymer bioconjugate to improve pharmacokinetic, increase half-life and stability of the enzyme. The conjugations were achieved by the cross-linking agent of 1-ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) which activates the carboxylic acid groups of polymeric nanoparticles to create amide bond. EDC conjugated the L-ASNase to two biodegradable polymers including; Ecoflex((R)) and poly (styrene-co-maleic acid) (PSMA) nanoparticles. To achieve optimal L-ASNase nanoparticles the amounts of each polymer and the crosslinker were optimized and the nanoparticles were characterized according to their particle size, zeta potential and percent of conjugation of the enzyme. The results showed that conjugated enzyme had more stability against pH changes and proteolysis. It had lower Km value (indicating more affinity to the substrate) and greater half-life in plasma and phosphate buffered saline, in comparison to native enzyme. Generally, the conjugated enzyme to PSMA nanoparticles showed greater results than Ecoflex((R)) nanoparticles.","['Varshosaz, Jaleh', 'Anvari, Negin']","['Varshosaz J', 'Anvari N']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Centre, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. varshosaz@pharm.mui.ac.ir.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Novel Drug Delivery Systems Research Centre, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,IET Nanobiotechnol,IET nanobiotechnology,101303205,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Enzymes, Immobilized/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Maleates/*chemistry', 'Nanoconjugates/*chemistry', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Polyesters/*chemistry', 'Polystyrenes/*chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2018/05/17 06:00,2019/09/14 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1049/iet-nbt.2017.0156 [doi]'],ppublish,IET Nanobiotechnol. 2018 Jun;12(4):466-472. doi: 10.1049/iet-nbt.2017.0156.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (ecoflex)', '25300-64-5 (styrene-maleic acid polymer)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvements in CAR T cell design are required to enhance clinical efficacy, as well as broaden the applicability of this technology. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-18 (IL-18)-secreting CAR T cells exhibit enhanced in vivo expansion and persistence and significantly increase long-term survival in syngeneic mouse models of both hematological and solid malignancies. In addition, we demonstrate that IL-18-secreting CAR T cells are capable of modulating the tumor microenvironment, as well as enhancing an effective endogenous anti-tumor immune response.

Our previous studies have reported that Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS) possess immunomodulatory effects and improve the immune effects of vaccines. In this study, avian leukosis virus subgroup B (ALV-B) was chosen as immunosuppressive virus to artificially establish immunosuppressive models in chickens, and the immune modulatory ability of TPPPS on the immune response of chickens was evaluated. Four randomly assigned groups (Group I-IV) of these immunosuppressed chickens were administered with TPPPS at doses of 0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg (every kilogram chick), respectively. Group V was administered with saline as control. At seven day old, 10 chickens randomly selected from Group I-V were inoculated with the attenuated Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine. The results showed that during the monitoring period, TPPPS significantly enhanced weight of immune organs, peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, the percentage of CD4+ and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+, IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, and ALV-B antibody positive rate of chickens in a dose-dependent manner, with 400 mg/kg TPPPS being the most effective. In addition, the antibody titer against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in Group IV with 400 mg/kg was significantly higher than those in other groups. We observed the stronger immunity in the TPPPS group, which indicates that TPPPS could be used as an immunoenhancer to relieve immunosuppression caused by ALV-B in the poultry industry.","['Yang, Shifa', 'Li, Guiming', 'Zhao, Zengcheng', 'Huang, Zhongli', 'Fu, Jian', 'Song, Minxun', 'Lin, Shuqian', 'Zhu, Ruiliang']","['Yang S', 'Li G', 'Zhao Z', 'Huang Z', 'Fu J', 'Song M', 'Lin S', 'Zhu R']","['a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'b College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine , Shandong Agricultural University , Taian , Shandong , China.', 'a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'b College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine , Shandong Agricultural University , Taian , Shandong , China.', 'a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'a Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Science , Jinan , Shandong , China.', 'b College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine , Shandong Agricultural University , Taian , Shandong , China.', 'b College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine , Shandong Agricultural University , Taian , Shandong , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180516,England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Plant/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology', 'Chickens/*immunology/*virology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Immune System/cytology/immunology/metabolism', '*Immunomodulation', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Pinus', 'Pollen/*immunology', 'Polysaccharides/*immunology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALV-B', 'immune response', 'immunoenhancer', 'immunosuppression', 'polysaccharide']",2018/05/17 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08820139.2018.1435689 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2018 Jul;47(5):443-456. doi: 10.1080/08820139.2018.1435689.

A study from the Bone Marrow Pathology Group.,78-85,10.1111/bjh.15276 [doi],"The JAK2 V617F mutation is characteristic of most Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and occurs rarely in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We sought to characterize AMLs that harbour this mutation and distinguish those that arise de novo (AML-DN) from those that reflect transformation of an underlying MPN (AML-MPN). Forty-five patients with JAK2 V617F-mutated AML were identified; 15 were AML-DN and 30 were AML-MPN. AML-MPN cases were more likely to have splenomegaly (P = 0.02), MPN-like megakaryocytes and higher mean JAK2 V617F VAF at diagnosis (P = 0.04). Mutations involving TET2 were exclusively identified in AML-DN patients. Mutations of genes affecting DNA methylation were more common in AML-DN (P < 0.01). A complex karyotype was more frequent in AML-MPN cases than in AML-DN (P < 0.01), with AML-DN more likely to display a normal karyotype (P = 0.02). Bone marrow histology after recovery from induction chemotherapy in AML-DN cases revealed no morphological evidence of any previously occult MPNs, while this was evident in most of the AML-MPN specimens (P < 0.01). These findings in this largest study of JAK2 V617F-mutated AMLs indicate that AML-DN is distinct from AML-MPN.","['Aynardi, Jason', 'Manur, Rashmi', 'Hess, Paul R', 'Chekol, Seble', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Babushok, Daria', 'Hexner, Elizabeth', 'Rogers, Heesun J', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Margolskee, Elizabeth', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Hasserjian, Robert', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Aynardi J', 'Manur R', 'Hess PR', 'Chekol S', 'Morrissette JJD', 'Babushok D', 'Hexner E', 'Rogers HJ', 'Hsi ED', 'Margolskee E', 'Orazi A', 'Hasserjian R', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180516,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*JAK2 V617F', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*myeloproliferative']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15276 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Jul;182(1):78-85. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15276.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibit properties of stemness and serve as a popular model to investigate epigenetic modifiers including environmental pollutants. Herein, the effects of low-dose ATO on differentiation were evaluated in vitro using a mouse ESCs (mESCs) cell line, CGR8. Cells treated with 0.2-0.5 muM ATO for 3-4 days had slight inhibition of proliferation with elevation of apoptosis, but obvious alterations of differentiation by morphological checking and alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining. Moreover, ATO exposure significantly decreased the mRNA expression of the stemness maintenance genes including Oct4, Nanog, and Rex-1 ( P < 0.01), whereas obviously increased some tissue-specific differentiation marker genes such as Gata4, Gata-6, AFP, and IHH. These alterations were consistent with the differentiation phenotype induced by retinoic acid (RA) and the expression patterns of distinct pluripotency markers such as SSEA-1 and Oct4. Furthermore, low-dose ATO led to a quantitative increase in Caspase 3 (CASP3) activation and subsequent cleavage of Nanog around 27 kDa, which corresponded with the mouse Nanog cleaved by CASP3 in a tube cleavage assay. Taken together, we suggest that low-dose ATO exposure will induce differentiation, other than apoptosis, of ESCs, such effects might be tuned partially by ATO-induced CASP3 activation and Nanog cleavage coupling with other differentiation related genes involved. The present findings provide a preliminary action mechanism of arsenic on the cell fate determination.","['Yuan, Wenlin', 'Chen, Jun', 'Huang, Hongren', 'Cai, Zhihui', 'Ling, Qinjie', 'Huang, Feng', 'Huang, Zhi']","['Yuan W', 'Chen J', 'Huang H', 'Cai Z', 'Ling Q', 'Huang F', 'Huang Z']","['Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology , Jinan University , Guangzhou 510632 , Guangdong Province , China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology , Jinan University , Guangzhou 510632 , Guangdong Province , China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology , Jinan University , Guangzhou 510632 , Guangdong Province , China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology , Jinan University , Guangzhou 510632 , Guangdong Province , China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology , Jinan University , Guangzhou 510632 , Guangdong Province , China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, School of Medical Engineering , Foshan University , Foshan 528000 , Guangdong Province , China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology , Jinan University , Guangzhou 510632 , Guangdong Province , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180524,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Environmental Pollutants/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2018/05/17 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00027 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2018 Jun 18;31(6):472-481. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00027.

As in many other BMF syndromes, SDS patients are predisposed to develop a number of haematopoietic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. However, the mechanism of cancer predisposition in SDS patients is only partially understood. In light of the emerging role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regulation of bone marrow homeostasis, we assessed the ability of MSCs derived from SDS patients (SDS-MSCs) to recreate a functional bone marrow niche, taking advantage of a murine heterotopic MSC transplant model. We show that the ability of semi-cartilaginous pellets (SCPs) derived from SDS-MSCs to generate complete heterotopic ossicles in vivo is severely impaired in comparison with HD-MSC-derived SCPs. Specifically, after in vitro angiogenic stimuli, SDS-MSCs showed a defective ability to form correct networks, capillary tubes and vessels and displayed a marked decrease in VEGFA expression. Altogether, these findings unveil a novel mechanism of SDS-mediated haematopoietic dysfunction based on hampered ability of SDS-MSCs to support angiogenesis. Overall, MSCs could represent a new appealing therapeutic target to treat dysfunctional haematopoiesis in paediatric SDS patients.","['Bardelli, Donatella', 'Dander, Erica', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Cappuzzello, Claudia', 'Pievani, Alice', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Pierani, Paolo', 'Corti, Paola', 'Farruggia, Piero', 'Dufour, Carlo', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Cipolli, Marco', 'Biondi, Andrea', ""D'Amico, Giovanna""]","['Bardelli D', 'Dander E', 'Bugarin C', 'Cappuzzello C', 'Pievani A', 'Fazio G', 'Pierani P', 'Corti P', 'Farruggia P', 'Dufour C', 'Cesaro S', 'Cipolli M', 'Biondi A', ""D'Amico G""]","['Paediatric Department, Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Paediatric Department, Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Paediatric Department, Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Paediatric Department, Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Centro Ricerca M.

We evaluated 1101 consecutive higher-risk MDS patients (International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high) and low-blast count acute myeloid leukaemia (AML; 21-30% blasts) patients treated in Ontario, Canada. By dosing schedule, 24.7% received AZA for seven consecutive days, 12.4% for six consecutive days and 62.9% by 5-2-2. Overall, median number of cycles was 6 (range 1-67) and 8 (range 6-14) when restricted to the 692 (63%) patients who received at least 4 cycles.

There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between the 3 dosing schedules (P = 0.87). In our large 'real-world' evaluation of AZA in higher-risk MDS/low-blast count AML, we demonstrated a lower than expected OS. Reassuringly, survival did not differ by dosing schedules. The OS was higher in the 2/3 of patients who received at least 4 cycles of treatment, reinforcing the necessity of sustained administration until therapeutic benefits are realised.

Many of these pathways converge on the same signalling molecules, including those involved in the Raf-1/MEK/Erk1/2-MAPK pathway. We investigated the effects of the MEK1/2 (also termed MAP2K1/2) inhibitor, binimetinib, against CLL cells cultured under conditions that mimic aspects of the tumour microenvironment. Binimetinib blocked CLL cell survival induced by stroma-conditioned media and phorbol myristylate (PMA). Binimetinib was also significantly more toxic towards CLL cells cultured in the presence of either anti-IgM antibody or stroma-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and reduced CLL cell cycle progression and proliferation. Furthermore, binimetinib significantly increased the sensitivity of CLL cells co-cultured with CD40 ligand (CD40L)-expressing fibroblasts to the BH3-mimetics ABT-737 and Venetoclax (ABT-199) via a mechanism involving down-regulation of Mcl-1 (MCL1) activity and Bim (BCL2L11) and Bcl-xL (BCL2L1) expression. Collectively, these data suggest that binimetinib may have both cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on CLL cells by blocking microenvironment-derived signals known to drive survival and proliferation. The combination of binimetinib with a BH3 mimetic may be an effective treatment strategy for CLL, particularly against the proliferative fraction of the disease within the tumour microenvironment.","['Crassini, Kyle', 'Shen, Yandong', 'Stevenson, William S', 'Christopherson, Richard', 'Ward, Chris', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Best, O Giles']","['Crassini K', 'Shen Y', 'Stevenson WS', 'Christopherson R', 'Ward C', 'Mulligan SP', 'Best OG']","['Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'CLL Australian Research Consortium (CLLARC), Kolling Institute of Medical Research, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'CLL Australian Research Consortium (CLLARC), Kolling Institute of Medical Research, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180516,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['* CLL', '*BH3-mimetic', '*MEK1/2', '*binimetinib', '*microenvironment']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15282 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Aug;182(3):360-372. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15282.

AIMS: Nevertheless, the mechanism of ABL2 in gastric cancer (GC) remains vague. METHODS: In the present study, the level of ABL2 in human GC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Also, the GC cell lines MGC-803 and BGC-823 were selected to stably knock down and overexpress the level of ABL2 by corresponding lentiviral vectors. Puromycin was used to maintain the stable low expression of ABL2 MGC-803 cells compared with control cells; what is more, the high expression of ABL2 BGC-823 cells was also obtained. Based on it, we detected the proteins associated with apoptosis, such as Bcl-2 family and caspase family by western blotting. RESULTS: The most appropriate concentration of puromycin to kill GC cells is 1 microg/mL; then, we obtained the corresponding stable cell lines. Furthermore, we found that high level of ABL2 in BGC-823 cells increased the expression of Bcl-XL, total PARP, and caspase3, while decreased the level of cleaved caspase3 and cleaved caspase9. Consistent results are received in MGC-803 cells. In addition, ABL2 overexpression led to the protein related with Ras/Erk and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway increased; also, we found that the major proteins play a significant role in it. CONCLUSION: All the data showed that high expression of ABL2 suppresses apoptosis through Ras/Erk and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in GC cell lines.","['Liu, Yun', 'Shao, Chen', 'Zhu, Linqi', 'Jiang, Sihong', 'Li, Guanlin', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Lin, Yajing', 'Ni, Ying', 'Cao, Hui', 'Shao, Shihe']","['Liu Y', 'Shao C', 'Zhu L', 'Jiang S', 'Li G', 'Zhang W', 'Lin Y', 'Ni Y', 'Cao H', 'Shao S']","['School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301 Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China. shaoshihe2006@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180516,United States,Dig Dis Sci,Digestive diseases and sciences,7902782,IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABL2', '*Apoptosis', '*Bcl-XL', '*Caspase', '*Gastric cancer']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10620-018-5111-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10620-018-5111-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Dig Dis Sci. 2018 Sep;63(9):2294-2300. doi: 10.1007/s10620-018-5111-7.

AML is generally classified based on either French-American-British (FAB) or World Health Organization (WHO) systems. For better clinical management, cytogenetic finding in AML is necessary and in patients with normal karyotypes - molecular, epigenetic and proteomic biomarkers are very important in choosing which drugs to prescribe. Mutations of certain genes like NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, RUNX1 and MLL play a crucial role in the risk management and clinical stratification of AML patients. We reviewed the literature for the current trends of clinical practice based on laboratory based diagnostic tests in AML. Outcome and Result: We listed in AML chromosomal aberrations (translocations, fusions or RUNX1, CBFB, MYHI1, MLL, EVI1, PML-RARA), genes and mutations (NPM1, FLT3, CEPBA, MLL) epigenetic factors (DNMT34, TET2) and proteomic biomarkers (PTP, PTK, PIP) and analysed how on the basis of these factors medical risk was stratified and accordingly managed. CONCLUSION: AML is genetically and functionally a heterogenous malignant disease. In the western world, leukemia is one of the most common among all cancers. India is ranked 3rd in cancer disease after United States of America and China. Cytogenetic analysis, molecular/proteomic biomarkers and epigenetic factors assist in determining the management strategies and prognosis of the disease. A number of targeted drugs in pre-clinical and clinical trials based on molecular factors and epigenetic mechanisms have been reported to have promising results in AML patients.","['Suguna, Elumalai', 'Farhana, Rahman', 'Kanimozhi, Elangovan', 'Kumar, Pindigiri Sai', 'Kumaramanickavel, Govindasamy', 'Kumar, Chitralekha Sai']","['Suguna E', 'Farhana R', 'Kanimozhi E', 'Kumar PS', 'Kumaramanickavel G', 'Kumar CS']","['Genomic Research Center, Sree Balaji Medical College & Hospital, Bharath University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Sree Balaji Medical College & Hospital, Bharath University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Central for Medical Genetics, SRM University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Central for Medical Genetics, SRM University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Sree Balaji Medical College & Hospital, Bharath University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Central for Medical Genetics, SRM University, Chennai, Tamilnadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,IM,"['Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proteomics/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CEBPA', '*FLT3', '*NPM1', '*cytogenetics', '*gene mutation', '*molecular biomarkers.']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['CHDDT-EPUB-90429 [pii]', '10.2174/1871529X18666180515130136 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2018;18(3):199-207. doi: 10.2174/1871529X18666180515130136.,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that a nitro-substituted hydrazone, namely, NHAPI, displayed markedly improved plasma stability, selective antitumor activity, and moderate antioxidant properties. In this study, we prepared four series of novel NHAPI derivatives and explored their iron chelation activities, anti- or pro-oxidant effects, protection against model oxidative injury in the H9c2 cell line derived from rat embryonic cardiac myoblasts, cytotoxicities to the corresponding noncancerous H9c2 cells, and antiproliferative activities against the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines. Nitro substitution had both negative and positive effects on the examined properties, and we identified new structure-activity relationships. Naphthyl and biphenyl derivatives showed selective antiproliferative action, particularly in the breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line, where they exceeded the selectivity of the parent compound NHAPI. Of particular interest is a compound prepared from 2-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-nitroacetophenone and biphenyl-4-carbohydrazide, which protected cardiomyoblasts against oxidative injury at 1.8 +/- 1.2 muM with 24-fold higher selectivity than SIH.

Meanwhile, the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which could be moderate or even life-threatening, has emerged as the most significant adverse effect in the clinical course of this novel targeting immunotherapy. In this systematic review, we analyzed the incidence of severe CRS in 19 clinical trials selected from studies published between 2010 and 2017. The pooled severe CRS proportion was 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3-49.1%) in B-ALL, 38.8% (95%CI 12.9-67.6%) in B-CLL, and 19.8% (95%CI 4.2-40.8%) in B-NHL. In the univariate meta regression analysis, the proliferation of CD19-CAR-T cell in vivo was correlated with the severe CRS. Specifically, total infusion cell dose contributed to the severe CRS occurring in B-ALL patients but not in B-CLL or B-NHL patients. Tumor burden was strongly associated with the severity of CRS in B-ALL. Besides, post-HSCT CD19 CAR-T cell infusion represented lower severe CRS incidence. Further investigations into the risk factors of CRS in B-CLL and B-NHL are needed.","['Jin, Zhen', 'Xiang, Rufang', 'Qing, Kai', 'Li, Xiaoyang', 'Zhang, Yunxiang', 'Wang, Lining', 'Zhu, Hongming', 'Mao, Yuanfei', 'Xu, Zizhen', 'Li, Junmin']","['Jin Z', 'Xiang R', 'Qing K', 'Li X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang L', 'Zhu H', 'Mao Y', 'Xu Z', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. xuzizhen@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Ruijin Er Road 197, Shanghai, China. drlijunmin@sina.com.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. drlijunmin@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20180515,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell', 'Chronic lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cytokine release syndrome']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3368-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3368-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Aug;97(8):1327-1335. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3368-8.

Because in various cell types CD36 facilitates FA uptake, we wondered whether a similar mechanism is operative CLL. We found that CD36 levels are higher in CLL cells than in normal B cells, and that small interfering RNA, CD36 neutralizing antibodies or sulfosuccinimidyl oleate (SSO) that inhibits CD36 significantly reduced the oxygen consumption of CLL cells incubated with FA. Because CD36 is oeverexpressed and STAT3 is constitutively activated in CLL cells, we wondered whether STAT3 induces CD36 expression. Sequence analysis identified putative STAT3 binding sites in the CD36 gene promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that STAT3 binds to the CD36 gene promoter. A luciferase assay and STAT3-small hairpin RNA, that significantly decreased the levels of CD36 in CLL cells, established that STAT3 activates the transcription of the CD36 gene. Furthermore, SSO induced a dose-dependent apoptosis of CLL cells. Taken together, our data suggest that STAT3 activates CD36 and that CD36 facilitates FA uptake in CLL cells. Whether CD36 inhibition would provide clinical benefits in CLL remains to be determined.","['Rozovski, Uri', 'Harris, David M', 'Li, Ping', 'Liu, Zhiming', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Burger, Jan', 'Thompson, Phillip', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Wierda, William', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Harris DM', 'Li P', 'Liu Z', 'Jain P', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Burger J', 'Thompson P', 'Jain N', 'Wierda W', 'Keating MJ', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180420,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD36', 'CLL', 'STAT3', 'metabolism']",2018/05/17 06:00,2018/05/17 06:01,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25066 [doi]', '25066 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 20;9(30):21268-21280. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25066. eCollection 2018 Apr 20.,,,PMC5940394,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST All authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason new therapeutic approaches are needed to treat this malignancy. The Endocannabinoid/Endovanilloid (EC/EV) system has been proposed as possible target to treat several malignancies, including lymphoblastic diseases. The EC/EV system is composed of two G-Protein Coupled Receptors (CB1 and CB2), the Transient Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, their endogenous and exogenous ligands and enzymes. CB1 is expressed mainly in central nervous system while CB2 predominantly on immune and peripheral cells, therefore we chose to selectively stimulate CB2 and TRPV1. We treated T-ALL lymphoblasts derived from 4 patients and Jurkat cells with a selective agonist at CB2 receptor: JWH-133 [100 nM] and an agonist at TRPV1 calcium channel: RTX [5 uM] at 6, 12 and 24 hours. We analyzed the effect on apoptosis and Cell Cycle Progression by a cytofluorimetric assays and evaluated the expression level of several target genes (Caspase 3, Bax, Bcl-2, AKT, ERK, PTEN, Notch-1, CDK2, p53) involved in cell survival and apoptosis, by Real-Time PCR and Western Blotting. We observed a pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative effect of these compounds in both primary lymphoblasts obtained from patients with T-ALL and in Jurkat cell line. Our results show that both CB2 stimulation and TRPV1 activation, can increase the apoptosis in vitro, interfere with cell cycle progression and reduce cell proliferation, indicating that a new therapeutic approach to T-cell ALL might be possible by modulating CB2 and TRPV1 receptors.","['Punzo, Francesca', 'Manzo, Iolanda', 'Tortora, Chiara', 'Pota, Elvira', ""Angelo, Velia D'"", 'Bellini, Giulia', 'Di Paola, Alessandra', 'Verace, Federica', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Rossi, Francesca']","['Punzo F', 'Manzo I', 'Tortora C', 'Pota E', 'Angelo V', 'Bellini G', 'Di Paola A', 'Verace F', 'Casale F', 'Rossi F']","['Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Division of Pharmacology ""Leonardo Donatelli"", University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Division of Pharmacology ""Leonardo Donatelli"", University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Division of Pharmacology ""Leonardo Donatelli"", University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Division of Pharmacology ""Leonardo Donatelli"", University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Women, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples 80138, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180420,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MYB', 'SKI', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'oncogene', 'transcriptional regulation']",2018/05/17 06:00,2018/05/17 06:01,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25052 [doi]', '25052 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 20;9(30):21244-21258. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25052. eCollection 2018 Apr 20.,,,PMC5940388,,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that a LSD1 inhibitor NCD38 induces transdifferentiation from erythroid lineage to granulomonocytic lineage and exerts anti-leukemia effect through de-repression of the specific super-enhancers of hematopoietic regulators including ERG in a human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL. However, the mechanistic basis for this specificity of NCD38 has remained unclear. Herein, we report major partners associated with LSD1 and clarify the mechanism in HEL cells. Proteome analysis identified 54 candidate proteins associated with LSD1, including several transcription factors such as GFI1B and RUNX1 as well as BRAF-histone deacetylase complex (BHC) components such as CoREST, HDAC1, and HDAC2. NCD38 selectively disrupted the interaction of LSD1 with GFI1B but not with RUNX1, CoREST, HDAC1 and HDAC2. Erg was downregulated in murine erythroid progenitors with prominent upregulation of Gfi1b. NCD38 induced ERG and attenuated an erythroid marker CD235a in HEL while this attenuation was mimicked by the lentiviral overexpression of ERG. The ERG super-enhancer contained the conserved binding motif of GFI1B and was actually occupied by GFI1B. NCD38 dissociated LSD1 and CoREST but not GFI1B from the ERG super-enhancer. Collectively, the selective separation of LSD1 from GFI1B by NCD38 restores the ERG super-enhancer activation and consequently upregulates ERG expression, inducing the transdifferentiation linked to the anti-leukemia effect.","['Yamamoto, Ryusuke', 'Kawahara, Masahiro', 'Ito, Shinji', 'Satoh, Junko', 'Tatsumi, Goichi', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Suzuki, Takayoshi', 'Andoh, Akira']","['Yamamoto R', 'Kawahara M', 'Ito S', 'Satoh J', 'Tatsumi G', 'Hishizawa M', 'Suzuki T', 'Andoh A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.', 'Medical Research Support Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Medical Research Support Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.', 'CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180420,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GFI1B', 'LSD1', 'RUNX1', 'leukemia', 'super-enhancer']",2018/05/17 06:00,2018/05/17 06:01,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.24774 [doi]', '24774 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Apr 20;9(30):21007-21021. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.24774. eCollection 2018 Apr 20.,,,PMC5940392,,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have declared that they have no competing', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AZD1208 is a potent ATP-competitive PIM kinase inhibitor investigated in patients with recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or advanced solid tumours. METHODS: Two dose-escalation studies were performed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of AZD1208 in AML and solid tumours. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of AZD1208. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients received treatment: 32 in the AML study over a 120-900 mg dose range, and 25 in the solid tumour study over a 120-800 mg dose range. Nearly all patients (98.5%) in both studies experienced adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal (92.5%). Dose-limiting toxicities included rash, fatigue and vomiting. AZD1208 was not tolerated at 900 mg, and the protocol-defined MTD was not confirmed. AZD1208 increased CYP3A4 activity after multiple dosing, resulting in increased drug clearance.

Treatment with the small-molecule inhibitors imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib resulted in resistance (c-KIT mutant tumors) or limited activity (c-KIT wild-type tumors). We selected an anti-c-KIT ADC approach to evaluate the anticancer activity in multiple disease models.Experimental Design: A humanized anti-c-KIT antibody LMJ729 was conjugated to the microtubule destabilizing maytansinoid, DM1, via a noncleavable linker (SMCC). The activity of the resulting ADC, LOP628, was evaluated in vitro against GIST, SCLC, and AML models and in vivo against GIST and SCLC models.Results: LOP628 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity on c-KIT-positive cell lines, whereas LMJ729 displayed little to no effect. At exposures predicted to be clinically achievable, LOP628 demonstrated single administration regressions or stasis in GIST and SCLC xenograft models in mice. LOP628 also displayed superior efficacy in an imatinib-resistant GIST model. Further, LOP628 was well tolerated in monkeys with an adequate therapeutic index several fold above efficacious exposures. Safety findings were consistent with the pharmacodynamic effect of neutropenia due to c-KIT-directed targeting. Additional toxicities were considered off-target and were consistent with DM1, such as effects in the liver and hematopoietic/lymphatic system.Conclusions: The preclinical findings suggest that the c-KIT-directed ADC may be a promising therapeutic for the treatment of mutant and wild-type c-KIT-positive cancers and supported the clinical evaluation of LOP628 in GIST, AML, and SCLC patients.

METHODS: The clinical characteristics and laboratory results were retrospectively analyzed in 10 children with newly diagnosed JMML. They were compared with those of 28 children with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 44 children with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). RESULTS: Compared with the children with CML or MDS, the children with JMML had significantly higher rates of skin rashes, ecchymosis, and lymphadenectasis, a significantly lower serum cholinesterase (ChE) level, and a significantly higher fetal hemoglobin level (P&lt;0.05). The white blood cell count of children with JMML was significantly higher than that of children with MDS, but significantly lower than that of children with CML (P&lt;0.05). In addition, the myeloid/erythroid ratio and rate of dyshaematopoiesis were significantly lower in children with JMML than those in children with CML or MDS. The children with JMML had a significantly higher expression of mature monocyte marker CD14 than those with CML or MDS (P&lt;0.05). The levels of myeloid markers CD33, CD11b, CD13, and CD15 in children with JMML were significantly higher than those in children with MDS, but significantly lower than those in children with CML (P&lt;0.05). The levels of CD2 and CD7 in children with JMML were higher than those in children with CML, but lower than those in children with MDS (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Skin rashes, ecchymosis, lymphadenectasis, and ChE reduction are more common in children with JMML than in those with CML or MDS, while dyshaematopoiesis is less common.

MicroRNAs have been determined to contribute various cancers initiation and progression, including AML. Although microRNA-204 (miR-204) exerts anti-tumor effects in several kinds of cancers, its function in AML remains unknown. In the present study, we assessed miR-204 expression in AML blood samples and cell lines. We also investigated the effects of miR-204 on cellular function of AML cells and the underlying mechanisms of the action of miR-204. Our results showed that miR-204 expression was significantly downregulated in AML tissues and cell lines. In addition, overexpression of miR-204 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in AML cells, including AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 cells. Cell cycle analysis further confirmed an augmentation in theapoptotic subG1 population by miR-204 overexpression. Mechanistically, baculoviral inhibition of apoptosis protein repeat containing 6 (BIRC6) was identified as a direct target of miR-204. Enforcing miR-204 expression increased the luciferase activity and expression of BIRC6, as well as p53 and Bax expression. Moreover, restoration of BIRC6 reversed the pro-apoptotic effects of miR-204 overexpression in AML cells. Taken together, this study demonstrates that miR-204 causes AML cell apoptosis by targeting BIRC6, suggesting miR-204 may play an anti-carcinogenic role in AML and function as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease.

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for leukaemia must be developed. Malaria parasite infection has been shown to be effective at combating certain neoplasms in animal experiments. This study is to demonstrate the anti-leukaemia activity of malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii (P. yoelii) infection,. METHODS: In this study, the proportion of CD3, CD19, CD11b and Mac-3 cells was analysed by flow cytometry; the levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in individual serum samples were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the phagocytic activity of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cell activity were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that P. yoelii infection significantly attenuated the growth of WEHI-3 cells in mice. In addition, tumor cell infiltration into the murine liver and spleen was markedly reduced. We also demonstrated that malaria parasite infection elicited anti-leukaemia activity by promoting immune responses, including increasing the surface markers of T cells (CD3) and B cells (CD19); decreasing the surface markers of monocytes (CD11b) and macrophages (Mac-3); inducing the secretion of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha; and increasing NK cell and macrophage activity. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria parasite infection significantly decreases the number of myeloblasts and inhibits neoplasm proliferation in mice. In addition, malaria parasite infection inhibits murine leukaemia by promoting immune responses.","['Tong, Zhen-Zhen', 'Fang, Zheng-Ming', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Zhan, Yun', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Jiang, Wan-Fang', 'Hou, Xiao', 'Li, Yong-Long', 'Wang, Ting']","['Tong ZZ', 'Fang ZM', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhan Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang WF', 'Hou X', 'Li YL', 'Wang T']","['Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Parasitology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China. wangting139@hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180516,England,Infect Dis Poverty,Infectious diseases of poverty,101606645,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Malaria/*immunology/parasitology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmodium yoelii/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-leukaemia', 'Leukaemia', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'WEHI-3 cells']",2018/05/17 06:00,2018/09/13 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40249-018-0433-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s40249-018-0433-4 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Dis Poverty. 2018 May 16;7(1):48. doi: 10.1186/s40249-018-0433-4.,,,PMC5954458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review discusses the impact of ibrutinib and idelalisib on the immune system, including infectious and auto-immune complications as well as their specific effects on the B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid compartment.","['Pleyer, Christopher', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Sun, Clare']","['Pleyer C', 'Wiestner A', 'Sun C']","['a Hematology Branch , National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'a Hematology Branch , National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'a Hematology Branch , National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180515,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Infections/chemically induced/epidemiology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Purines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Lymphoid leukemia', '*T-cell mediated immunity', '*signaling therapies', '*the humoral immune response']",2018/05/17 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/05/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1457147 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Dec;59(12):2792-2800. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1457147.

Using a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach, we identified somatic coding and noncoding variants that may contribute to leukemogenesis in 11 adult Korean acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, with serial tumor samples (primary and relapse) available for 5 of them; somatic variants were identified in 187 AML-related genes, including both novel (SIN3A, C10orf53, PTPRR, and RERGL) and well-known (NPM1, RUNX1, and CEPBA) AML-related genes. Notably, SIN3A expression shows prognostic value in AML. A newly designed method, referred to as ""hot-zone"" analysis, detected two putative functional noncoding variants that can alter transcription factor binding affinity near PPP1R10 and SRSF1. Moreover, the functional importance of the SRSF1 noncoding variant was further investigated by luciferase assays, which showed that the variant is critical for the regulation of gene expression leading to leukemogenesis. We expect that further functional investigation of these coding and noncoding variants will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of AML and the development of targeted anti-cancer drugs.","['Min, Jae-Woong', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Kim, Dae-Yoon', 'Kim, Hyung-Lae', 'Han, Jeong A', 'Jung, Yu-Jin', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Choi, Sun Shim']","['Min JW', 'Koh Y', 'Kim DY', 'Kim HL', 'Han JA', 'Jung YJ', 'Yoon SS', 'Choi SS']","['Division of Biomedical Convergence, College of Biomedical Science, Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', ""Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Ewha Woman's University, Seoul 03760, Korea."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Biomedical Convergence, College of Biomedical Science, Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180515,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Ontology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Whole Genome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'somatic variants', 'whole genome sequencing']",2018/05/16 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2018.0051 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2018.0051 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2018 May 31;41(5):465-475. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2018.0051.

Patients with B-CLL strongly express the CD23 - C type of lectin (low affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RII), which is linked to B cell activation and proliferation. Phosphorylation in lymphocytes is tightly associated with regulation of protein activities, functional regulation and cell signaling, and may thus affect initiation and/or progression of the disease. Here we report changes in the phosphorylation of CD23 on threonine (pThr314) and two serine residues (pSer254, pSer265) in B lymphocytes of B-CLL patients, using a flow cytometry approach. The majority of tested patients with active forms of B-CLL presented a notable overexpression of CD23 along with pThr314, pSer254, and pSer265 CD23 phosphorylation positivity. Moreover, we have experimentally stimulated the CD23 phosphorylations in a subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy controls by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. This affects the activation of competent phosphorylation mediating kinases, resulting in the enhanced phosphorylation pattern. Together, these data confirm that CD23 protein is phosphorylated in B cells of B-CLL patients, report the identification of new CD23 phosphorylation sites, and suggest a possible role(s) of such phosphorylations in the activation of CD23 during the process of lymphocytic activation in B-CLL.","['Madarova, Martina', 'Mucha, Rastislav', 'Hresko, Stanislav', 'Makarova, Zuzana', 'Gdovinova, Zuzana', 'Szilasiova, Jarmila', 'Vitkova, Marianna', 'Guman, Tomas', 'Stecova, Natalia', 'Dobransky, Tomas']","['Madarova M', 'Mucha R', 'Hresko S', 'Makarova Z', 'Gdovinova Z', 'Szilasiova J', 'Vitkova M', 'Guman T', 'Stecova N', 'Dobransky T']","['DB Biotech, Popradska 80, 04011 Kosice, Slovakia.', 'DB Biotech, Popradska 80, 04011 Kosice, Slovakia.', 'DB Biotech, Popradska 80, 04011 Kosice, Slovakia.', 'DB Biotech, Popradska 80, 04011 Kosice, Slovakia.', 'Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine Pavol Jozef Safarik University, L.

These pathways involve the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Fes, Syk, and the three Src-family kinases expressed in myeloid cells (Fgr, Hck, and Lyn). In this study, we report remarkable anti-AML efficacy of an N-phenylbenzamide kinase inhibitor, TL02-59. This compound potently suppressed the proliferation of bone marrow samples from 20 of 26 AML patients, with a striking correlation between inhibitor sensitivity and expression levels of the myeloid Src family kinases Fgr, Hck, and Lyn. No correlation was observed with Flt3 expression or mutational status, with the four most sensitive patient samples being wild-type for Flt3. Kinome-wide target specificity profiling coupled with in vitro kinase assays demonstrated a narrow overall target specificity profile for TL02-59, with picomolar potency against the myeloid Src-family member Fgr. In a mouse xenograft model of AML, oral administration of TL02-59 for 3 weeks at 10 mg/kg completely eliminated leukemic cells from the spleen and peripheral blood while significantly reducing bone marrow engraftment. These results identify Fgr as a previously unrecognized kinase inhibitor target in AML and TL02-59 as a possible lead compound for clinical development in AML cases that overexpress this kinase independent of Flt3 mutations.","['Weir, Mark C', 'Shu, Sherry T', 'Patel, Ravi K', 'Hellwig, Sabine', 'Chen, Li', 'Tan, Li', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Weir MC', 'Shu ST', 'Patel RK', 'Hellwig S', 'Chen L', 'Tan L', 'Gray NS', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School and Department of Cancer Biology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , 250 Longwood Avenue , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School and Department of Cancer Biology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , 250 Longwood Avenue , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , United States.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180530,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2018/05/16 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.8b00154 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2018 Jun 15;13(6):1551-1559. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00154.

We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (MTR) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association. PROCEDURE: We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in MTR. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes. RESULTS: Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and initial white blood cell count < 50 x 109/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46-16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions. DISCUSSION: Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the in utero origins of ALL.","['Schraw, Jeremy M', 'Yiu, Teresa T', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Tsavachidis, Spiridon', 'Rau, Rachel', 'Bondy, Melissa L', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Schraw JM', 'Yiu TT', 'Lupo PJ', 'Tsavachidis S', 'Rau R', 'Bondy ML', 'Rabin KR', 'Shen L', 'Scheurer ME']","['Dan L.

The complete blood count may reveal pancytopenia including monocytopenia. Median age at diagnosis is approximately 55. Poor prognostic features, while somewhat variable in the literature, may include age, hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, platelets less than 100, ANC less than 1000, the presence of lymphadenopathy, and massive splenomegaly. Differential diagnosis includes other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including splenic marginal zone lymphoma. A distinct entity is known as hairy cell leukemia variant (HCL-V), which is biologically unique from HCL also exists. Response to typical HCL in this disease is poor. The variant can be identified by immunophenotypic differences, lack of BRAF mutation, and lack of monocytopenia.[1][2] HCL accounts for 2% of all leukemias with approximately 1000 new cases being reported in the United States each year.","['Naing, Phyu Thin', 'Acharya, Utkarsh']","['Naing PT', 'Acharya U']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,2018/05/16 06:01,2018/05/16 06:01,,,['NBK499845 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20180516,,['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],,,['2018/05/16 06:01'],['20210811'],

Recent studies confirm that TRIM22 is a target gene for P53, and inhibits clonogenic growth of leukemic U-937 cells. The current study aims to discover the effect of TRIM22 in progression of human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and explore the related mechanism. TRIM22 was knocked down by siRNA transfection in CML cell K562. We observed that TRIM22 knockdown decreased proliferation and invasion in K562 cells. TRIM22 knockdown significantly induced cell cycle arrest by regulating the level of CDK4, Cyclin D1, P70S6K, and P53 in K562 cell. Moreover, loss of TRIM22 also promoted apoptosis through modulation of Bcl-2, Bax and active Caspase 3 in K562 cell. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRIM22 knockdown inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by decreasing the level of the phosphorylated form p-Akt and p-mTOR in K562 cell. In conclusion, loss of TRIM22 suppresses the progression and invasion of CML through regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, suggesting that TRIM22 might be as a potential target for the treatment strategy of CML.","['Li, Liyin', 'Qi, Yanhua', 'Ma, Xiaobo', 'Xiong, Guosheng', 'Wang, Lijun', 'Bao, Cuixia']","['Li L', 'Qi Y', 'Ma X', 'Xiong G', 'Wang L', 'Bao C']","['Department of Hematology, Yunnan Research Center of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, P.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) plays an important role in several cancers. However, the role of lncRNA UCA1 in AML remained unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LncRNA UCA1 expressions in different cell lines were determined by RT-PCR. In human myelogenous leukemia (ML) cell lines K562 and HL60, effects of lncRNA UCA1 knockdown on cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were assessed, respectively. Binding effects between lncRNA UCA1 and microRNA (miR)-126, and between miR-126 and RAC1 3'UTR were detected by RT-PCR and luciferase activity assay. Involvements of miR-126 and RAC1 in lncRNA UCA1-mediated cell bioactivities were assessed. RESULTS: We found that lncRNA UCA1 was upregulated in ML cell lines. Knockdown of lncRNA UCA1 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, and prompted apoptosis of ML cells in vitro. LncRNA UCA1 could bind with miR-126 and downregulate miR-126 expression. Simultaneously, the anti-growth and anti-metastasis actions of lncRNA UCA1 knockdown on ML cells were reversed by miR-126 suppression. RAC1 was a target gene of miR-126, and the anti-ML actions of miR-126 were abolished by RAC1 overexpression. Moreover, PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were blocked by miR-126 overexpression while were activated by RAC1 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study elucidates a novel UCA1-miR-126-RAC1 regulatory network in ML cells, which may provide the feasibility for use lncRNA-based therapy in AML treatment.","['Sun, M-D', 'Zheng, Y-Q', 'Wang, L-P', 'Zhao, H-T', 'Yang, S']","['Sun MD', 'Zheng YQ', 'Wang LP', 'Zhao HT', 'Yang S']","[""Department of Hematology, Binzhou People's Hospital, Binzhou, Shandong, China. yangsheng170518@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*physiology']",,,2018/05/16 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201804_14809 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Apr;22(8):2233-2245. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201804_14809.,"['0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (UCA1 RNA, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BL irradiation can specially inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of U937 cells, relating to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). The apoptosis is further associated with varying downregulated B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) genes, upregulated Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) gene, the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by the BL irradiation process. Moreover, BL irradiation induced proliferation inhibition is higher than that treated by a common chemotherapeutic drug of homoharringtonine (HHT). When we synergize BL irradiation with HHT (BL-HHT), a higher proliferation inhibition is obtained than that treated by BL irradiation or HHT alone. These results are helpful for establishing a low toxicity and high efficiency strategy of BL irradiation for clinical treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, not limited to U937 cells.","['Zhuang, Jianjian', 'Liu, Junsong', 'Gao, Xuan', 'Li, Hongdong']","['Zhuang J', 'Liu J', 'Gao X', 'Li H']","['State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China. zhuangjianjian1234@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China. jsliu@jlu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China. gaoxuan16@mails.jlu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China. hdli@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180515,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', '*Light', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['BL irradiation', 'U937 cells', 'apoptosis', 'enhanced proliferation inhibition']",2018/05/16 06:00,2018/09/22 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19051464 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19051464 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 May 15;19(5). pii: ijms19051464. doi: 10.3390/ijms19051464.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,PMC5983758,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway plays a crucial role in tumor host immunity evasion and its blockade has emerged as an effective anti-cancer immunotherapy. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression has shown predictive value in anti-PD cancer immunotherapy; however, it has not been well documented in CLL/SLL and DLBCL-RT. We evaluated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 39 CLL/SLL, 15 DLBCL-RT, and 26 other DLBCL. In CLL/SLL, neoplastic B-cell PD-1 expression was weak and restricted to prolymphocytes/paraimmunoblasts within proliferation centers (PCs) and accentuated PCs of all sizes. Neoplastic B-cell PD-1 expression was highly prevalent and demonstrated increased intensity in DLBCL-RT, but in contrast was only rarely seen in other DLBCL (12/15 vs. 1/26; P<0.0001). An excellent correlation (90% concordance) was observed between neoplastic B-cell PD-1 immunohistochemistry positivity and molecularly defined CLL/SLL clonal relatedness in DLBCL-RT. PD-L1 expression was observed on the neoplastic B cells in rare DLBCL-RT and other DLBCL cases (1/15 vs. 1/26; P>0.05) as well as background histiocytes and dendritic cells. Overall survival of DLBCL-RT was significantly inferior to that of the other DLBCL (median, 16.9 vs. 106.1 mo; P=0.002). Our findings suggest a biological continuum from prolymphocytes/paraimmunoblasts in CLL/SLL PCs to the neoplastic B-cells in DLBCL-RT. The characteristic PD-1 expression in DLBCL-RT makes it a potential surrogate marker for determining clonal relatedness to CLL/SLL, which may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications.","['He, Rong', 'Ding, Wei', 'Viswanatha, David S', 'Chen, Dong', 'Shi, Min', 'Van Dyke, Daniel', 'Tian, Shulan', 'Dao, Linda N', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Mai, Ming', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Rech, Karen L']","['He R', 'Ding W', 'Viswanatha DS', 'Chen D', 'Shi M', 'Van Dyke D', 'Tian S', 'Dao LN', 'Parikh SA', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Call TG', 'Ansell SM', 'Leis JF', 'Mai M', 'Hanson CA', 'Rech KL']","['Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Hematology.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Laboratory Genetics and Genomics.', 'Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Hematology.', 'Hematology.', 'Hematology.', 'Hematology.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Scottsdale, AZ.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.', 'Divisions of Hematopathology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'B7-H1 Antigen/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,,2018/05/16 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000001077 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2018 Jul;42(7):843-854. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001077.,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responses to standard cytotoxic therapy in AML are often transient because of the emergence of chemotherapy-resistant disease. The MUC1-C oncoprotein governs critical pathways of tumorigenesis, including self-renewal and survival, and is aberrantly expressed in AML blasts and leukaemia stem cells (LSCs). However, a role for MUC1-C in linking leukaemogenesis and resistance to treatment has not been described. In this study, we demonstrate that MUC1-C overexpression is associated with increased leukaemia initiating capacity in an NSG mouse model. In concert with those results, MUC1-C silencing in multiple AML cell lines significantly reduced the establishment of AML in vivo. In addition, targeting MUC1-C with silencing or pharmacologic inhibition with GO-203 led to a decrease in active beta-catenin levels and, in-turn, down-regulation of survivin, a critical mediator of leukaemia cell survival. Targeting MUC1-C was also associated with increased sensitivity of AML cells to Cytarabine (Ara-C) treatment by a survivin-dependent mechanism. Notably, low MUC1 and survivin gene expression were associated with better clinical outcomes in patients with AML. These findings emphasize the importance of MUC1-C to myeloid leukaemogenesis and resistance to treatment by driving survivin expression. Our findings also highlight the potential translational relevance of combining GO-203 with Ara-C for the treatment of patients with AML.","['Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Rajabi, Hasan', 'Nahas, Myrna', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Rahimian, Maryam', 'Pyzer, Athalia', 'Tagde, Ashujit', 'Kharbanda, Akriti', 'Jain, Salvia', 'Kufe, Turner', 'Leaf, Rebecca K', 'Anastasiadou, Eleni', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Orr, Shira', 'Coll, Maxwell D', 'Palmer, Kristen', 'Ephraim, Adam', 'Cole, Leandra', 'Washington, Abigail', 'Kufe, Donald', 'Avigan, David']","['Stroopinsky D', 'Rajabi H', 'Nahas M', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Rahimian M', 'Pyzer A', 'Tagde A', 'Kharbanda A', 'Jain S', 'Kufe T', 'Leaf RK', 'Anastasiadou E', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Orr S', 'Coll MD', 'Palmer K', 'Ephraim A', 'Cole L', 'Washington A', 'Kufe D', 'Avigan D']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180515,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['MUC1', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'survivin']",2018/05/16 06:00,2018/05/16 06:01,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/16 06:01 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13662 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Aug;22(8):3887-3898. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13662.

We aimed to further explore the association using primary data from 16 studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Data were contributed by 11 case-control (CC) studies (7919 cases and 12,942 controls recruited via interviews) and five nested case-control (NCC) studies (8801 cases and 29,690 controls identified through record linkage of population-based health registries) with variable enrollment periods (1968-2015). Five-year paternal and maternal age increments were introduced in two meta-analyses by study design using adjusted odds ratios (OR) derived from each study. Increased paternal age was associated with greater ALL risk in the offspring (ORCC 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.11; ORNCC 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07). A similar positive association with advanced maternal age was observed only in the NCC results (ORCC 0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.07, heterogeneity I(2) = 58%, p = 0.002; ORNCC 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08). The positive association between parental age and risk of ALL was most marked among children aged 1-5 years and remained unchanged following mutual adjustment for the collinear effect of the paternal and maternal age variables; analyses of the relatively small numbers of discordant paternal-maternal age pairs were not fully enlightening. Our results strengthen the evidence that advanced parental age is associated with increased childhood ALL risk; collinearity of maternal with paternal age complicates causal interpretation. Employing datasets with cytogenetic information may further elucidate involvement of each parental component and clarify underlying mechanisms.","['Petridou, Eleni Th', 'Georgakis, Marios K',

METHODS: Five hundred and one consecutive newly diagnosed subjects with CLL were enrolled in this case cohort. HBV infection was defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis-B core antibody (HBcAb) positive. Univariate and stepwise multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen the prognostic risk factors associated with the end point of time-to-treatment (TTT) or overall survival (OS). Bootstrap re-sampling method was used to evaluate the model's internal validity. The discriminative ability of the models was evaluated using time-dependent receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and corresponding areas under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one subjects (24%) among 501 patients were HBV positive. HBV infection was an independent predictor for the prognosis of TTT (HR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.04-1.80) or OS (HR =2.85; 95% CI 1.80-4.52). The AUCs for HBV infection were 0.62 (95% CI 0.58-0.66) for TTT and 0.69 (95% CI 0.66-0.72) for OS, respectively. When we combined HBV infection with the traditional clinical and biological factors, significant improvements for model's discrimination were observed for TTT [AUC: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85) vs. 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.82), P < 0.001] and OS [AUC: 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.86) vs. 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.82), P < 0.001). Further bootstrap re-sampling method revealed good internal consistence for the final optimal models (Average AUC: 0.78 for TTT and 0.79 for OS based on 1000 bootstraps). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that HBV infection should be served as an important risk predictor for prognosis of CLL (TTT and OS).","['Liang, Jin-Hua', 'Gao, Rui', 'Dai, Jun-Cheng', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Li, Wang', 'Fan, Lei', 'Hu, Zhi-Bin', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong']","['Liang JH', 'Gao R', 'Dai JC', 'Gale RP', 'Li W', 'Fan L', 'Hu ZB', 'Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Nanjing Medical University School of Public Health, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Haematology Research Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Nanjing Medical University School of Public Health, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. xuwei10000@hotmail.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. xuwei10000@hotmail.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China. xuwei10000@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@medmail.com.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@medmail.com.cn.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@medmail.com.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180514,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'China', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/*complications', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'HBV', 'Overall survival', 'Prognostic biomarker', 'Time to first treatment']",2018/05/16 06:00,2019/03/23 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-018-2663-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-018-2663-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2018 Jul;144(7):1309-1315. doi: 10.1007/s00432-018-2663-z.

Hematopoietic function of the bone marrow is involved in the production of all blood cells types. The benzene metabolites including benzoquinone and mucoaldehyde affect hematopoietic stem cells as well as differentiation steps of progenitor cells for each blood cell. Hence, we concluded that benzene was associated with all lymphohematic carcinogenesis. First, it is supported by biological plausibility. Second, it is supported by meta-analysis although sing study did not show relationship due to lack of sample size or statistical power. More recent studies show lesser exposed level related to risk of cancer, compare to past studies did. Actually, early studies show the risk of malignancies in workers who exposed more than 200 ppm-years. However, only 0.5 to 1 ppm-year benzene exposed show significant linking to risk of malignancies in recent study.

The cycles of chemo- and radiotherapy used to treat AML can impair dental development. Case Report: Herein, we describe the oral condition of a 25-year-old male patient treated for AML with chemo- and radiotherapy from 5 to 7 years of age; his AML has remained in remission for the past 18 years. He had lost only one permanent tooth, but the remaining teeth demonstrated serious deformations and radicular hypoplasia. Two teeth required immediate extraction and subsequent replacement by implant-supported crowns. We found that the decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) index was not representative of the real oral condition. Here, we report the full case and provide a brief review of the literature. Conclusion: Antitumor treatment of pediatric leukemia can induce total impairment of dental development and function. These adverse effects may become clinically evident many years after the resolution of cancer, and can be significantly detrimental to the patient's quality of life.","['Lupi, Saturnino Marco', 'Rodriguez Y Baena, Arianna', 'Cervino, Gabriele', 'Todaro, Claudia', 'Rizzo, Silvana']","['Lupi SM', 'Rodriguez Y Baena A', 'Cervino G', 'Todaro C', 'Rizzo S']","['Department of Clinical, Surgical, Pediatric and Diagnostic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Pavia, P.le Golgi 2, 27100 Pavia , Italy.', 'Department of Clinical, Surgical, Pediatric and Diagnostic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Pavia, P.le Golgi 2, 27100 Pavia , Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences, Morphological and Functional Images, School of Dentistry, University of Messina, Policlinico G.

Although it is found in the Lewy bodies in synucleinopathies and in Alzheimer's disease, the protein could also be considered as a novel marker in diagnosis of diseases related to the hematopoietic system. Methods: The current study evaluated alpha-synuclein expression in bone marrow sections obtained from 9 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)-M6, 2 patients with AML-M7, and 56 patients with other forms of AML by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Results: Seven out of 9 cases with erythroleukemia (66.7%) and 1 of the 2 cases with M7 (50%) were positive. In contrast; the blasts in 2 out of 56 AML cases with non-M6/M7 (3.6%) showed positive staining. Accordingly, alpha-synuclein was positive in normal erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes (if existing) in these cases; while, it was negative in lymphoid and myeloid precursors. Conclusion: Alpha-synuclein expression in non-neoplastic and neoplastic erythroid cells and megakaryocytes could be used as a complementary and useful marker for distinction between AML-M6/M7 and other types of AML.","['Kosari, Farid', 'Akbarzadeh Hosseini, Sanam', 'Saffar, Hiva']","['Kosari F', 'Akbarzadeh Hosseini S', 'Saffar H']","['Dept. of Pathology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pathology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pathology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160830,Iran,Iran J Pathol,Iranian journal of pathology,101515128,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-M6', 'AML-M7', 'Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'alpha- Synuclein']",2017/01/01 00:00,2017/01/01 00:01,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2015/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pathol. 2017 Winter;12(1):74-78.

Factors associated with travel time are also unknown. This study aimed to describe the distribution of travel time for hospital admission of cancer patients and identify underlying factors. METHODS: The individual data from the Patient Survey in 2011 were linked to those from the Survey of Medical Institutions in the same year, and GIS data were used to calculate driving travel time between the addresses of medical institutions and the population centers of municipalities where patients lived. Proportions of patients with travel time exceeding versus not exceeding 45 minutes were calculated. To analyze the data with consideration of both individual factors of patients and geographical characteristics of areas where patients lived, multilevel logistic model analysis was performed. RESULTS: The analysis included 50,845 cancer inpatients. The majority of the cancer patients (approximately 80%) were admitted to hospitals located less than a 45-minute drive from their residences. The travel time tended to be longer for younger patients. The proportion of patients with travel time >/=45 minutes was lower among those with stomach or colorectal cancer (approximately 15%) than those with cervical cancer or leukemia (approximately 30%). The lack of designated cancer care hospitals in the secondary healthcare service areas was significantly associated with travel time. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of hospitals by cancer inpatients is affected by age, cancer sites, and availability of designated cancer care hospitals in the secondary healthcare service areas where patients live.","['Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Ishikawa, Koichi B', 'Katanoda, Kota']","['Tanaka H', 'Ishikawa KB', 'Katanoda K']","['Department of Public Health, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.', 'Center for Public Health Sciences, National Cancer Center.', 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180512,Japan,J Epidemiol,Journal of epidemiology,9607688,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Female', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health Services Accessibility/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Travel/*statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['geographic information systems', 'health services accessibility', 'healthcare disparities', 'neoplasms', 'travel time']",2018/05/16 06:00,2018/12/21 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2188/jea.JE20170051 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol. 2018 Nov 5;28(11):470-475. doi: 10.2188/jea.JE20170051.

The molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant HOX gene expression and associated AML pathogenesis remain unclear. The nuclear protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), when bound to insulator sequences, constrains temporal HOX gene-expression patterns within confined chromatin domains for normal development. Here, we used targeted pooled CRISPR-Cas9-knockout library screening to interrogate the function of CTCF boundaries in the HOX gene loci. We discovered that the CTCF binding site located between HOXA7 and HOXA9 genes (CBS7/9) is critical for establishing and maintaining aberrant HOXA9-HOXA13 gene expression in AML. Disruption of the CBS7/9 boundary resulted in spreading of repressive H3K27me3 into the posterior active HOXA chromatin domain that subsequently impaired enhancer/promoter chromatin accessibility and disrupted ectopic long-range interactions among the posterior HOXA genes. Consistent with the role of the CBS7/9 boundary in HOXA locus chromatin organization, attenuation of the CBS7/9 boundary function reduced posterior HOXA gene expression and altered myeloid-specific transcriptome profiles important for pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Furthermore, heterozygous deletion of the CBS7/9 chromatin boundary in the HOXA locus reduced human leukemic blast burden and enhanced survival of transplanted AML cell xenograft and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Thus, the CTCF boundary constrains the normal gene-expression program, as well as plays a role in maintaining the oncogenic transcription program for leukemic transformation. The CTCF boundaries may serve as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of myeloid malignancies.","['Luo, Huacheng', 'Wang, Fei', 'Zha, Jie', 'Li, Haoli', 'Yan, Bowen', 'Du, Qinghua', 'Yang, Fengchun', 'Sobh, Amin', 'Vulpe, Christopher', 'Drusbosky, Leylah', 'Cogle, Christopher', 'Chepelev, Iouri', 'Xu, Bing', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Licht, Jonathan', 'Qiu, Yi', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Huang, Suming']","['Luo H', 'Wang F', 'Zha J', 'Li H', 'Yan B', 'Du Q', 'Yang F', 'Sobh A', 'Vulpe C', 'Drusbosky L', 'Cogle C', 'Chepelev I', 'Xu B', 'Nimer SD', 'Licht J', 'Qiu Y', 'Chen B', 'Xu M', 'Huang S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Affiliated Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliate Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Genetics, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliate Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'University of Florida Health Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL; and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'University of Florida Health Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Affiliated Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL.', 'University of Florida Health Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL; and.', 'Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Avenida Wai Long, Taipa, Macau.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180514,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,2018/05/16 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31969-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-11-814319 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Aug 23;132(8):837-848. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-11-814319.

SUMMARY: Apoptosis is a tightly regulated biological process mediated by both proapoptotic (i.e., prodeath) and antiapoptotic (i.e., prosurvival) proteins. While apoptosis represents a well-established effector mechanism induced by conventional chemotherapy in many malignancies, the development of apoptosis-based targeted therapy is relatively new. The pharmacologic restoration of apoptotic functions, either by blocking the action of antiapoptotic proteins/regulators (e.g., through investigational therapies such as inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, SMAC [second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases] mimetics, MDM2 [murine double minute 2] antagonists) or by inducing apoptosis (e.g., through investigational agonistic monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins), holds robust potential for cancer pharmacotherapy. Notably, BH domain 3 (BH3) mimetics, a new class of small molecules that block the action antiapoptotic proteins, are touted a success for apoptosis-based targeted therapy. Venetoclax, a synthetic peptide that belongs to this class of BH3 mimetics, is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with 17p deletion as a single agent. This agent has been increasingly used either alone or as part of combination therapy for diverse hematologic malignancies in clinical trials.

Genome-based analysis, exome sequencing, transcriptomics and proteomics have provided insight into genetic classification of ALL and helped identify novel subtypes of the disease. B and T cell-based ALL are two well-characterized genomic subtypes, significantly marked by bone marrow disorders, along with mutations in trisomy 21 and T53. The other ALLs include Early T-cell precursor ALL, Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL, Down syndrome-associated ALL and Relapsed ALL. Chromosomal number forms a basis of classification, such as, hypodiploid ALL, near-haploid, low-hypodiploid, high-hypodiploid and hypodiploid-ALL. Advances in therapies targeting ALL have been noteworthy, with significant pre-clinical and clinical studies on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine are leading drugs with best demonstrated efficacies against childhood ALL. The drugs in combination, following dose titration, have also been used for maintenance therapy. Methotrexate-polyglutamate is a key metabolite that specifically targets the disease pathogenesis, and 6-thioguanine nucleotides, derived from 6-mercaptopurine, impede replication and transcription processes, inducing cytotoxicity. Additionally, glucocorticoids, asparaginase, anthracycline, vincristine and cytarabine that trans-repress gene expression, deprives cells of asparagine, triggers cell cycle arrest, influences cytochrome-P450 polymorphism and inhibits DNA polymerase, respectively, have been used in chemotherapy in ALL patients. Overall, this review covers the progress in genome technology related to different sub-types of ALL and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of its medications. It also enlightens adverse effects of current drugs, and emphasizes the necessity of genome-wide association studies for restricting childhood ALL.","['Wu, Chuan', 'Li, Wei']","['Wu C', 'Li W']","['Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin, China.

However, the molecular mechanisms of chromosome translocations remain largely unknown. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a DNA damage signaling regulator, facilitates DNA repair to prevent chromosome abnormalities. Previously, we showed that ATM deficiency led to the 11q23 chromosome translocation, the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemia. Here, we show that ARP8, a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, is phosphorylated after etoposide treatment. The etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 is regulated by ATM and ATR, and attenuates its interaction with INO80. The ATM-regulated phosphorylation of ARP8 reduces the excessive loading of INO80 and RAD51 onto the breakpoint cluster region. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of ARP8, regulated by ATM, plays an important role in maintaining the fidelity of DNA repair to prevent the etoposide-induced 11q23 abnormalities.","['Sun, Jiying', 'Shi, Lin', 'Kinomura, Aiko', 'Fukuto, Atsuhiko', 'Horikoshi, Yasunori', 'Oma, Yukako', 'Harata, Masahiko', 'Ikura, Masae', 'Ikura, Tsuyoshi', 'Kanaar, Roland', 'Tashiro, Satoshi']","['Sun J', 'Shi L', 'Kinomura A', 'Fukuto A', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Oma Y', 'Harata M', 'Ikura M', 'Ikura T', 'Kanaar R', 'Tashiro S']","['Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Regulatory Network, Department of Mutagenesis, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Regulatory Network, Department of Mutagenesis, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Oncode Institute, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Cellular Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180508,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,IM,"['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rad51 Recombinase/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ARP8 phosphorylation', '*ATM', '*ATR', '*INO80', '*RAD51', '*chromosome translocations', '*chromosomes', '*gene expression', '*human']",2018/05/16 06:00,2019/05/02 06:00,['2018/05/16 06:00'],"['2017/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.32222 [doi]', '32222 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2018 May 8;7. pii: 32222. doi: 10.7554/eLife.32222.,"['0 (ACTR8 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (INO80 protein, human)']",,PMC5953535,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0563-1245', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9364-8727', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7331-157X']","['(c) 2018, Sun et al.']",,,"['JS, LS, AK, AF, YH, YO, MH, MI, TI, RK, ST No competing interests declared']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The outcomes of 73 patients with MDS receiving haploidentical transplantation were analyzed, according to the MTPSS, the TRI, and the CIBMTR scoring systems. RESULTS: The median age of patients at transplantation was 50 (range, 19-69) years. The IPSS-R cytogenetic risks of very good/good, intermediate, and poor/very poor were, respectively, observed in 35 (48.0%), 25 (34.2%), and 13 (17.8%) patients, including 4 (5.5%) with a monosomal karyotype. Pretransplant treatment failure and high (>/=3) HCT-CI were observed in 30 (41.1%) and 35 (48.0%) patients, respectively. With survivor's median follow-up of 42.3 months, the overall survival rate at 4 years of all patients was 65.5% (95% CI, 52.4-75.9). The MTPSS (100%, 77.3%, 62.5%, and 42.0% at 4 years; P = .02) and the TRI (100%, 79.9%, 76.0%, and 17.1% at 4 years; P < .01) differentiate proportionally overall survival rates according to their 4 risk groups, whereas the CIBMTR scoring system did not (P = .17).

AGS62P1 metabolism was assessed in xenograft tumor-bearing mice and rats treated with the ADC using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry-based methods described herein. In this study, we identified the metabolite of AGS62P1 as pAF-AGL-0185-30, which contains a fragment resulting from the catabolism of the antibody component of the ADC and hydrolysis of the terminal amide portion of the linker-payload. We demonstrated that the metabolite of AGS62P1 is tolerated in rats above 1.5 mg/kg and above 0.334 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys when given as a single dose. Furthermore, we established in vitro that pAF-AGL-0185-30 does not significantly inhibit hERG or cytochrome P450 family enzymes (CYPs).","['Snyder, Josh T', 'Malinao, Maria-Christina', 'Dugal-Tessier, Julien', 'Atkinson, John E', 'Anand, Banmeet S', 'Okada, Akihiro', 'Mendelsohn, Brian A']","['Snyder JT', 'Malinao MC', 'Dugal-Tessier J', 'Atkinson JE', 'Anand BS', 'Okada A', 'Mendelsohn BA']","['Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.', 'Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.', 'Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.', 'Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.', 'Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.', 'Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.', 'Agensys Inc. an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc. , 1800 Stewart Street , Santa Monica , California 90404 , United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180514,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/administration & dosage/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oximes/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antibody drug conjugate', '*auristatin', '*metabolism', '*non-natural amino acid', '*pharmacokinetics']",2018/05/15 06:00,2019/07/04 06:00,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00225 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2018 Jun 4;15(6):2384-2390. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00225.

Two chimeric peptides (CP-1 and CP-2) were designed using linear immunodominant epitopes of gp-46-I, and gp21-I proteins, according to the sequence from Uniprot database. These peptides were studied initially in the ELISA using infected sera. The most promising peptideCP-1, was used to develop a peptide ELISA for detection of HTLV-I infected sera. The optimal conditions for CP-1ELISA were: the optimum coating buffer was 100mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6; coating peptide concentration was 10 microg/mL; the optimal blocking buffer was5% fetal bovine serum (FBS); the secondary antibody concentration was 1:2000; and serum dilution was 1:20. 20serum samples from HTLV-I infected patients were evaluated by ELISA developed. CP-1 showed high antigenicity while lacking any cross-reactivity with normal human sera. The results of evaluations indicated that in comparison with commercial ELISA, CP-1 ELISA showed good sensitivity and specificity. With further validation, CP-1as described in the present study could be introduced as novel reliable and cost-effective candidates for the high-specific screening of HTLV-I/-II infections in endemic regions.","['Mosadeghi, Parvin', 'Heydari-Zarnagh, Hafez']","['Mosadeghi P', 'Heydari-Zarnagh H']","['Department of Biology, Basic Science Faculty, Payam Noor University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Iran,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",101146178,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Antigens/chemistry/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*diagnosis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*chemistry/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Antigenicity', 'HTLV-I', 'Synthetic peptides', 'gp-46-I', 'gp21-I', 'p19']",2018/05/15 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2018 Apr;17(2):144-150.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to study the correlations between stress and disease-specific, negative prognostic cellular, cytokine, and chemokine markers in patients with CLL. METHODS: A single-group, observational design was used. Patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (N = 96) who were entering a phase 2 trial of an experimental therapy (ibrutinib) were studied. Before the first dose, a validated self-report measure of stress (the Impact of Event Scale) was completed, and blood was drawn for absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) and for cytokine and chemokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Multiple linear regression models tested stress as a concurrent predictor of ALCs; of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha], a proliferation-inducing ligand [APRIL], B-cell activating factor [BAFF], interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-10, IL-16, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]); and of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3). RESULTS: Controlling for relevant demographic variables, comorbidities, CLL genetic risk (deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 [del17p]), and correlates of inflammation, stress predicted higher ALCs (P < .05), and higher levels of TNFalpha (P < .05), IL-16 (P < .01), and CCL3 (P < .05). Stress was not associated with APRIL, BAFF, IL-6, IL-10, or VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: Novel biobehavioral data from patients with relapsed/refractory CLL demonstrate that stress is related to heightened levels of cellular, cytokine, and chemokine markers associated previously with progressive disease in CLL. The current results indicate that stress is related to immune and inflammatory processes that contribute to cancer cell proliferation and survival. These data provide a first look into these processes. Cancer 2018.

Evidence supporting such a cutoff is lacking. We hypothesized that 300-cell counts could be sufficient. Methods: Cell count results from 165 cases, for which values were recorded at 300 and 500 cells, were analyzed. We tested for statistical differences and changes in diagnostic classification between the two cutoffs. Results: Three hundred cell counts did not produce diagnostically different results, particularly for myeloblasts and plasma cells, where cell percentages are critical for disease classification. Method comparison analysis did not reach statistical significance for any cell type when comparing the two methods. Bias plots showed narrow, even spread about the mean bias. Contingency table analysis yielded no significant diagnostic discrepancies. Conclusions: Performing differential counts on 300 cells would produce clinically and statistically similar results to 500 cells. Reducing the cell number counted has potential cost/labor reductions without affecting quality of care.","['Abdulrahman, Ahmed A', 'Patel, Kirtesh H', 'Yang, Tong', 'Koch, David D', 'Sivers, Sarah M', 'Smith, Geoffrey H', 'Jaye, David L']","['Abdulrahman AA', 'Patel KH', 'Yang T', 'Koch DD', 'Sivers SM', 'Smith GH', 'Jaye DL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Plasma Cell/*classification/diagnosis/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,2018/05/15 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['4994945 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqy034 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2018 May 31;150(1):84-91. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqy034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a separation of spatial dimension between DNA replication and RNA biogenesis, and protein synthesis, which is an interesting phenomenon. The former occurs in the cell nucleus, while the latter in the cytoplasm. The separation requires protein to transport across the nuclear envelope to realize a variety of biological functions. Nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein including import to the nucleus and export to the cytoplasm is a complicated process that requires involvement and interaction of many proteins. In recent years, many studies have found that proteins constantly shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. These shuttling proteins play a crucial role as transport carriers and signal transduction regulators within cells. In this review, we describe the mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport of shuttling proteins and summarize some important diseases related shuttling proteins.","['Fu, Xuekun', 'Liang, Chao', 'Li,

Here, we show CD155 expression in both malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in humans and mice. Cd155-/- mice displayed reduced tumor growth and metastasis via DNAM-1 upregulation and enhanced effector function of CD8+ T and NK cells, respectively. CD155-deleted tumor cells also displayed slower tumor growth and reduced metastases, demonstrating the importance of a tumor-intrinsic role of CD155. CD155 absence on host and tumor cells exerted an even greater inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. Blockade of PD-1 or both PD-1 and CTLA4 was more effective in settings in which CD155 was limiting, suggesting the clinical potential of cotargeting PD-L1 and CD155 function.","['Li, Xian-Yang', 'Das, Indrajit', 'Lepletier, Ailin', 'Addala, Venkateswar', 'Bald, Tobias', 'Stannard, Kimberley', 'Barkauskas, Deborah', 'Liu, Jing', 'Aguilera, Amelia Roman', 'Takeda, Kazuyoshi', 'Braun, Matthias', 'Nakamura, Kyohei', 'Jacquelin, Sebastien', 'Lane, Steven W', 'Teng, Michele Wl', 'Dougall, William C', 'Smyth, Mark J']","['Li XY', 'Das I', 'Lepletier A', 'Addala V', 'Bald T', 'Stannard K', 'Barkauskas D', 'Liu J', 'Aguilera AR', 'Takeda K', 'Braun M', 'Nakamura K', 'Jacquelin S', 'Lane SW', 'Teng MW', 'Dougall WC', 'Smyth MJ']","['Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Medical Genomics, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Division of Cell Biology, Biomedical Research Center and Department of Biofunctional Microbiota, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Gordon and Jessie Gilmour Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Gordon and Jessie Gilmour Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ""The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", 'School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', 'Cancer Immunoregulation and Immunotherapy and.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'Immuno-oncology Discovery, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, Queensland, Australia.', 'Immunology in Cancer and Infection Laboratory and.', 'School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Herston, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180514,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Virus/*deficiency/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer immunotherapy', '*Immunology']",2018/05/15 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2017/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['98769 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI98769 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Jun 1;128(6):2613-2625. doi: 10.1172/JCI98769.

However, its prognostic value has not yet been fully clarified. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, Hazard Ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall-survival (OS) were chosen to evaluate the prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutations and to compare SRSF2 mutations to those with wild-type. RESULTS: A total of 2056 patients from 12 studies were obtained. The pooled HRs for OSsuggested that patients with MDS had a poorer prognosis (HR = 1.780, 95% CI (1.410-2.249)), while analysis on SRSF2 mutations revealed no significant effect on the prognosis of CMML patients (HR = 1.091, 95% CI (0.925-1.286)). The frequency of SRSF2 mutations was found to be 11.5% and 39.8% in patients with MDS and CMML, respectively. DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis suggests that SRSF2 has a poor prognosis in patients with MDS, but no prognosis impact on patients with CMML. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, SRSF2 mutations were significantly related to the shorter OS in patients with MDS which may consider as an adverse prognostic risk factor. Whereas, analysis did not show any prognostic effect on OS of CMML patients with SRSF2 mutations.","['Arbab Jafari, Pourya', 'Ayatollahi, Hossein', 'Sadeghi, Ramin', 'Sheikhi, Maryam', 'Asghari, Amir']","['Arbab Jafari P', 'Ayatollahi H', 'Sadeghi R', 'Sheikhi M', 'Asghari A']","['a Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.', 'a Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.', 'b Department of Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.', 'c Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.', 'd Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20180514,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*mortality', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'SRSF2 mutation', 'meta-analysis', 'prognosis']",2018/05/15 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1471794 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):778-784. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1471794.

Matsum.], has revealed the inhibitory effect on colon carcinogenesis in rat cancer model although the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used two types of human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 p53(+/+) and HCT116 p53(-/-) ) to investigate the anticancer activity and molecular mechanisms of 6-MSITC. Interestingly, 6-MSITC inhibited the cell proliferation in both types of cells with similar IC50 value although a light increase in the phosphorylation and accumulation of P53 protein was observed in HCT116 p53(+/+) cells at 24 h after treatment. In addition, 6-MSITC increased the ratio of proapoptotic cells in both types of cells with the same fashion in a p53-independent manner. The data from mitochondrial analysis revealed that 6-MSITC enhanced the ratio of proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein/antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1, and sequentially caused mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ) loss, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation in both types of cells. Taken together, Wasabi 6-MSITC induced apoptosis of human colorectal cancer cells in p53-independent mitochondrial dysfunction pathway. These findings suggest that 6-MSITC might be a potential agent for colon cancer chemoprevention although with p53 mutation.

However, few biomarker studies have evaluated NHL risk associated with these fats. We conducted a prospective study of 583 incident NHL cases and 583 individually matched controls with archived pre-diagnosis red blood cell (RBC) specimens in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). RBC membrane fatty acid levels were measured using gas chromatography. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of NHL and major NHL subtypes including T cell NHL (T-NHL), B cell NHL (B-NHL) and three individual B-NHLs: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma. RBC SFA and MUFA levels were not associated with NHL risk overall. However, RBC very long chain SFA levels (VLCSFA; 20:0, 22:0, 23:0) were inversely associated with B-NHLs other than CLL/SLL; ORs (95% CIs) per standard deviation (SD) increase in level were 0.81 (0.70, 0.95) for 20:0, 0.82 (0.70, 0.95) for 22:0 and 0.82 (0.70, 0.96) for 23:0 VLCSFA. Also, both VLCSFA and MUFA levels were inversely associated with T-NHL [ORs (95% CIs) per SD: VLCSFA, 0.63 (0.40, 0.99); MUFA, 0.63 (0.40, 0.99)]. The findings of inverse associations for VLCSFAs with B-NHLs other than CLL/SLL and for VLCSFA and MUFA with T-NHL suggest an influence of fatty acid metabolism on lymphomagenesis.","['Chiu, Yu-Han', 'Bertrand, Kimberly A', 'Zhang, Shumin', 'Laden, Francine', 'Epstein, Mara M', 'Rosner, Bernard A', 'Chiuve, Stephanie', 'Campos, Hannia', 'Giovannucci, Edward L', 'Chavarro, Jorge E', 'Birmann, Brenda M']","['Chiu YH', 'Bertrand KA', 'Zhang S', 'Laden F', 'Epstein MM', 'Rosner BA', 'Chiuve S', 'Campos H', 'Giovannucci EL', 'Chavarro JE', 'Birmann BM']","['Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H.

Methods: All adults with preexisting DM and newly diagnosed AML at Roswell Park Cancer Institute were reviewed (January 2003-December 2010, n = 78). Creatinine clearance (CrCl) and total body weight distributions were used in a two-compartment PK model adapted for multiple dosing and modified to account for actual intra- and inter-individual variability. Based on this renal function variability evidence, 1000 PK profiles were simulated for multiple metformin regimens with the resultant PK profiles being assessed for safe CrCl thresholds. Findings: Metformin 500 mg up to three times daily was safe for all simulated profiles with CrCl >/=25 mL/min. Furthermore, the estimated overall MALA risk was below 10%, remaining under 5% for 500 mg given once daily. CrCl >/=65.25 mL/min was safe for administration in any of the tested regimens (500 mg or 850 mg up to three times daily or 1000 mg up to twice daily). Conclusion: PK simulation-guided prescribing can maximize metformin's beneficial effects on cancer outcomes while minimizing MALA risk.","['Ceacareanu, Alice C', 'Brown, Geoffrey W', 'Moussa, Hoda A', 'Wintrob, Zachary A P']","['Ceacareanu AC', 'Brown GW', 'Moussa HA', 'Wintrob ZAP']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Services, ROAKETIN Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Services, ROAKETIN Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, NYS Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Services, ROAKETIN Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Res Pharm Pract,Journal of research in pharmacy practice,101614023,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Metformin', 'Metformin-associated lactic acidosis', 'pharmacokinetics']",2018/05/15 06:00,2018/05/15 06:01,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jrpp.JRPP_17_53 [doi]', 'JRPP-7-41 [pii]']",ppublish,J Res Pharm Pract. 2018 Jan-Mar;7(1):41-45. doi: 10.4103/jrpp.JRPP_17_53.,,,PMC5934987,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The understanding of the origin and function of these mutations at early stages of transformation is critical to understand the etiology of the disease and for the design of effective therapies. The chromosome inversion inv(16) is thought to arise as a founding mutation in a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) to produce preleukemic HSCs (preL-HSCs) with myeloid bias and differentiation block, and predisposed to AML. Studies in mice and human AML cells have established that inv(16) AML follows a clonal evolution model, in which preL-HSCs expressing the fusion protein CBFbeta-SMMHC persist asymptomatic in the bone marrow.

While blinatumomab showed lower rates of infection, neutropenia and mucosal barrier injury versus chemotherapy, its infection risks are not well described. Methods: All patients who received blinatumomab for >/= seven days at an academic cancer center from May 2015 to April 2017 were included. Patient characteristics pertinent to infectious risks and complications were examined. Results: Twenty patients with refractory (25%), relapsed (70%), or remitted (5%) B-ALL who received a total of 35 cycles were included. Ten of the 35 cycles were interrupted, none of which were due to infections. Twenty-six infections (n) were observed with lower respiratory (9), gastrointestinal (6) and bacteremia (5) being most common. Compared to patients without nodular, possible mold pneumonia (n=16), patients with nodular pneumonia (n=4) had significantly lower baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (2319 v. 208/muL, p=0.011). There were no differences in baseline characteristics including ANC between bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients. One patient was discharged with no antibacterial prophylaxis since ANC recovered to >500cells/muL, but developed Pseudomonal bacteremia within a week with ANC ~100cells/muL. Conclusion: Despite blinatumomab's relatively modest myelosuppression and the lack of mucotoxicity, host factors (e.g., duration and degree of neutropenia/lymphopenia) play a key role and should be considered when choosing anti-microbial prophylaxis. In relapsed/refractory disease, the ANC should be monitored closely post blinatumomab since neutropenia can unexpectedly develop after treatment which may be compounded by the underlying disease and recent chemotherapy effects.","['So, Wonhee', 'Pandya, Shuchi', 'Quilitz, Rod', 'Shah, Bijal', 'Greene, John N']","['So W', 'Pandya S', 'Quilitz R', 'Shah B', 'Greene JN']","['Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Infectious Diseases Associates of Tampa Bay, 4729 N Habana Ave, Tampa, FL 33614, USA.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180501,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Blinatumomab', 'Infection', 'Neutropenia', 'Prophylaxis']",2018/05/15 06:00,2018/05/15 06:01,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2018.029 [doi]', 'mjhid-10-1-e2018029 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2018 May 1;10(1):e2018029. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2018.029. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5937972,,,,,['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentrations of nilotinib and imatinib in maternal milk were measured and nilotinib distribution in human breast milk was demonstrated for the first time. The estimated maximal doses of imatinib and nilotinib which an infant may ingest with the maternal milk were less than the therapeutical doses. However, the unknown impact of the low dose chronic exposure to these TKIs in infants imposes the limitations on their use during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding without TKI treatment may be safe with molecular monitoring, but preferably in those patients with CML who have durable deep molecular response.","['Chelysheva, Ekaterina', 'Aleshin, Sergey', 'Polushkina, Evgenia', 'Shmakov, Roman', 'Shokhin, Igor', 'Chilov, Ghermes', 'Turkina, Anna']","['Chelysheva E', 'Aleshin S', 'Polushkina E', 'Shmakov R', 'Shokhin I', 'Chilov G', 'Turkina A']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Center of Pharmaceutical Analytics Ltd, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'FSBI National Research Center of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology of the Healthcare Ministry named after V.I.

Methods: We conducted a prospective surveillance study of gut colonisation with CRE and its impact on the outcome of 225 consecutive patients of HM over 28 months. Results: The median age of the cohort was 46 years, the majority with acute leukaemia. 48 (21%) patients were colonised with CRE on admission (CAD). Another 46 patients were colonised with CRE in the hospital (CIH). The risk factors for CAD and CIH were a diagnosis of acute leukaemia and duration of hospital stay respectively. CRE accounted for 77% of infection-related mortality (IRM). The incidence of CRE bacteremia in CRE positive patients was 18% (17/94), and mortality in those with CRE bacteremia was 100%. IRM was 35.3% in CIH group compared to 10.5% in the CAD group (p=0.0001). IRM was highest in those with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and CIH (54.9% p=0.0001). On multivariate analysis, CIH was the most important risk factor for IRM (HR-7.2). Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that a substantial proportion of patients with HM are colonised with CRE without prior hospitalisation, but those with nosocomial colonisation have the highest risk of mortality, particularly in those with AML.","['Jaiswal, Sarita Rani', 'Gupta, Satyanker', 'Kumar, Rekha Saji', 'Sherawat, Amit', 'Rajoreya, Ashok', 'Dash, Saroj K', 'Bhagwati, Gitali', 'Chakrabarti, Suparno']","['Jaiswal SR', 'Gupta S', 'Kumar RS', 'Sherawat A', 'Rajoreya A', 'Dash SK', 'Bhagwati G', 'Chakrabarti S']","['Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Microbiology, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Manashi Chakrabarti Foundation, Kolkata, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180501,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae', 'Colonization', 'Haematological malignancies', 'Mortality']",2018/05/15 06:00,2018/05/15 06:01,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2018.025 [doi]', 'mjhid-10-1-e2018025 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2018 May 1;10(1):e2018025. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2018.025. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5937952,,,,,['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, additional prognostic markers are needed in order to better classify patients. The hypothesis of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) heterogeneity and persistence, suggests that their functional evaluation could be of clinical interest. In this work, we assessed the primitive and progenitor fractions in patients at diagnosis and during TKI treatment using functional in vitro assays, defining a ""functional leukemic burden"" (FLB). We observed that the FLB was reduced in vivo in both fractions upon treatment. However, different FLB levels were observed among patients according to their response to treatment, suggesting that quantification of the FLB could complement early molecular monitoring. Given that FLB assessment is limited by BCR-ABL1 mRNA expression levels, we developed a novel detection method of primitive cells at the DNA level, using patient-specific primers and direct nested PCR in colonies obtained from functional in vitro assays. We believe that this method could be useful in the context of discontinuation trials, given that it is unknown whether the persistent leukemic clone represents LSCs, able to resume the leukemia upon TKI removal.","['Ruiz, Maria Sol', 'Sanchez, Maria Belen', 'Gutierrez, Leandro', 'Koile, Daniel', 'Yankilevich, Patricio', 'Mosqueira, Celeste', 'Cranco, Santiago', 'Custidiano, Maria Del Rosario', 'Freitas, Josefina', 'Foncuberta, Cecilia', 'Moiraghi, Beatriz', 'Pavlovsky, Carolina', 'Perez, Mariel Ana', 'Ventriglia, Veronica', 'Avalos, Julio Sanchez', 'Mordoh, Jose', 'Larripa, Irene', 'Bianchini, Michele']","['Ruiz MS', 'Sanchez MB', 'Gutierrez L', 'Koile D', 'Yankilevich P', 'Mosqueira C', 'Cranco S', 'Custidiano MDR', 'Freitas J', 'Foncuberta C', 'Moiraghi B', 'Pavlovsky C', 'Perez MA', 'Ventriglia V', 'Avalos JS', 'Mordoh J', 'Larripa I', 'Bianchini M']","['Centro de Investigaciones Oncologicas-Fundacion Cancer (CIO-FUCA), Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Oncologicas-Fundacion Cancer (CIO-FUCA), Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Argenomics, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental, CONICET/Academia Nacional de Medicina, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigacion en Biomedicina de Buenos Aires (IBioBA), CONICET, Partner Institute of the Max Planck Society, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigacion en Biomedicina de Buenos Aires (IBioBA), CONICET, Partner Institute of the Max Planck Society, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Argenomics, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Alexander Fleming, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Alexander Fleming, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital Nacional Posadas, El Palomar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto Alexander Fleming, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital J.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that physical cues influence cancer cell migration and affect tumour metastasis. In this study, we proposed the use of a microchannel chip equipped with a number of vertical constrictions to produce periodic compression forces on cells passing through narrow channels. The chip with repeated vertical confinement was applied on adherent MHCC-97L liver cancer cells and suspended OCI-AML leukaemia cells to determine the migration ability of these cancer cells. Given the stimulation of the periodic mechanical confinement on-chip, the migration ability of cancer cells was promoted. Moreover, the migration speed increased as the stimulation was enhanced. Both AFM nanoindentation and optical stretching tests on cancer cells were performed to measure their mechanical property. After confinement stimulation, the cancer cells possessed higher deformability and lower stiffness than non-stimulating cells. The confinement stimulation altered the cell cytoskeleton, which governs the migration speed. This phenomenon was determined through gene expression analysis. The proposed on-chip cell migration assays will help characterise the migration property of cancer cells and benefit the development of new therapeutic strategies for metastasis.","['Ma, Dongce', 'Wang, Ran', 'Chen, Shuxun', 'Luo, Tao', 'Chow, Yu-Ting', 'Sun, Dong']","['Ma D', 'Wang R', 'Chen S', 'Luo T', 'Chow YT', 'Sun D']","['Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180427,United States,Biomicrofluidics,Biomicrofluidics,101293825,,,,,2018/05/15 06:00,2018/05/15 06:01,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1063/1.5030135 [doi]', '1.5030135 [pii]', '001803BMF [pii]']",epublish,Biomicrofluidics. 2018 Apr 27;12(2):024118. doi: 10.1063/1.5030135. eCollection 2018 Mar.,,,PMC5924377,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1113-2693', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9851-6459', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3945-4037']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, PR3 is a serine protease whose membrane expression can potentiate inflammatory diseases such as ANCA-associated vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis. During apoptosis, PR3 is co-externalized with phosphatidylserine (PS) and is known to modulate the clearance of apoptotic cells through a calreticulin (CRT)-dependent mechanism. The complement protein C1q is one mediator of efferocytosis, the clearance of altered self-cells, particularly apoptotic cells. Since PR3 and C1q are both involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and immune response modulation and share certain common ligands (i.e., CRT and PS), we examined their possible interaction. We demonstrated that C1q binding was increased on apoptotic rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells that expressed PR3, and we demonstrated the direct interaction between purified C1q and PR3 molecules as shown by surface plasmon resonance. To better understand the functional consequence of this partnership, we tested C1q-dependent phagocytosis of the RBL cell line expressing PR3 and showed that PR3 impaired C1q enhancement of apoptotic cell uptake. These findings shed new light on the respective roles of C1q and PR3 in the elimination of apoptotic cells and suggest a novel potential axis to explore in autoimmune diseases characterized by a defect in apoptotic cell clearance and in the resolution of inflammation.","['Tacnet-Delorme, Pascale', 'Gabillet, Julie', 'Chatfield, Simon', 'Thieblemont, Nathalie', 'Frachet, Philippe', 'Witko-Sarsat, Veronique']","['Tacnet-Delorme P', 'Gabillet J', 'Chatfield S', 'Thieblemont N', 'Frachet P', 'Witko-Sarsat V']","['Universite Grenoble Alpes, CEA, CNRS, IBS, Grenoble, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Cochin Institute, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Cochin Institute, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Center of Excellence, LABEX Inflamex, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Cochin Institute, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Center of Excellence, LABEX Inflamex, Paris, France.', 'Universite Grenoble Alpes, CEA, CNRS, IBS, Grenoble, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Cochin Institute, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Center of Excellence, LABEX Inflamex, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180425,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Complement C1q/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Myeloblastin/genetics/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats']",['NOTNLM'],"['*C1q', '*apoptotic cells', '*autoimmunity', '*efferocytosis', '*proteinase 3']",2018/05/15 06:00,2018/05/15 06:01,['2018/05/15 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.00818 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Apr 25;9:818. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00818. eCollection 2018.,"['80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",,PMC5932363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of donor T cells to recognize antigenic structures on leukemic cell surfaces and destroy them is a well-known fact. Based on this fact, the idea of using donor T cells to contribute to the development of adoptive immunotherapy has emerged. Donor lymphocytes are easy to obtain and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have a simple rational while this treatment modality is an effective example of cellular therapy. The group of chronic myeloid leukemia patients who are more likely to benefit from DLI include: a) patients in the chronic phase of hematologic relapse and b) patients with molecular/cytogenetic relapse. DLI appear to be an appropriate treatment option to be used in combination with conventional chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents in the treatment of post-allo-HSCT relapse for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, if:) the burden of tumor is low b) the relapse is at a molecular level rather than an overt hematologic relapse c) the patient has favorable cytogenetic characteristics d) time interval between transplantation and relapse is relatively longer (>5 months) e) response could be obtained after salvage therapies. In the event that minimal residual disease (MRD) or increasing mixed chimerism is detected, prompt administration of DLI for prophylactic purposes without waiting for a manifest relapse, was found to be effective in inducing a full donor chimerism and overcoming MRD and eventually preventing a manifest relapse.","['Toprak, Selami Kocak']",['Toprak SK'],"['Ankara University, School of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Cebeci Hospital, Dikimevi, Ankara, Turkey.

Here, we combine deep epigenome mapping with single-cell transcriptomics to mine for evidence of chromatin dysregulation in type 2 diabetes. We find two chromatin-state signatures that track beta cell dysfunction in mice and humans: ectopic activation of bivalent Polycomb-silenced domains and loss of expression at an epigenomically unique class of lineage-defining genes. beta cell-specific Polycomb (Eed/PRC2) loss of function in mice triggers diabetes-mimicking transcriptional signatures and highly penetrant, hyperglycemia-independent dedifferentiation, indicating that PRC2 dysregulation contributes to disease. The work provides novel resources for exploring beta cell transcriptional regulation and identifies PRC2 as necessary for long-term maintenance of beta cell identity. Importantly, the data suggest a two-hit (chromatin and hyperglycemia) model for loss of beta cell identity in diabetes.","['Lu, Tess Tsai-Hsiu', 'Heyne, Steffen', 'Dror, Erez', 'Casas, Eduard', 'Leonhardt, Laura', 'Boenke, Thorina', 'Yang, Chih-Hsiang', 'Sagar', 'Arrigoni, Laura', 'Dalgaard, Kevin', 'Teperino, Raffaele', 'Enders, Lennart', 'Selvaraj, Madhan', 'Ruf, Marius', 'Raja, Sunil J', 'Xie, Huafeng', 'Boenisch, Ulrike', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Lynn, Francis C', 'Hoffman, Brad G', 'Grun, Dominic', 'Vavouri, Tanya', 'Lempradl, Adelheid M', 'Pospisilik, J Andrew']","['Lu TT', 'Heyne S', 'Dror E', 'Casas E', 'Leonhardt L', 'Boenke T', 'Yang CH', 'Sagar', 'Arrigoni L', 'Dalgaard K', 'Teperino R', 'Enders L', 'Selvaraj M', 'Ruf M', 'Raja SJ', 'Xie H', 'Boenisch U', 'Orkin SH', 'Lynn FC', 'Hoffman BG', 'Grun D', 'Vavouri T', 'Lempradl AM', 'Pospisilik JA']","['Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institute Germans Trias i Pujol, UAB, Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany; Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Diabetes Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, A4-184, 950 West 28 Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."", ""Diabetes Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, A4-184, 950 West 28 Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."", 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Program for Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institute Germans Trias i Pujol, UAB, Badalona 08916, Spain; Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus ICO - Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona 08916, Spain.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Stuebeweg 51, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.

METHODS: Analysis of clinical, biological and thoracic CT characteristics of patients with PM developing during the treatment of AL between 2000 and 2015. Day 0 (D0) was defined as the day with first CT evidence of PM. RESULTS: Among 1193 patients, 25 cases of PM were recorded during 2099 episodes of bone marrow aplasia. At time of diagnosis of PM, 24/25 patients had been neutropenic for a median of 12 days. None of the patients had diabetes mellitus. On initial CT (D0), the lesion was solitary in 20/25 cases and a reversed halo sign (RHS) was observed in 23/25 cases. From D1 to D7, D8 to D15 and after D15, RHS was seen in 100 %, 75 % and 27 % of cases, respectively. A tissue biopsy was positive in 17/18 cases. The detection of circulating Mucorales DNA in serum was positive in 23/24 patients and in 97/188 serum specimens between D-9 and D9. Bronchoalveolar lavage contributed to diagnosis in only 3/21 cases. The antifungal treatment was mainly based on liposomal amphotericin B combined with, or followed by, posaconazole. A pulmonary surgical resection was performed in 9/25 cases. At 3 months, 76 % of patients were alive and median overall survival was 14 months. CONCLUSION: In AL, early use of CT could improve the prognosis of PM. The presence of a RHS on CT suggests PM and is an indication for prompt antifungal treatment.","['Caillot, D', 'Legouge, C', 'Lafon, I', 'Ferrant, E', 'Pages, P B', 'Plocque, A', 'Estivalet, L', 'Valot, S', 'Dalle, F', 'Abou Hanna, H', 'Chretien, M-L']","['Caillot D', 'Legouge C', 'Lafon I', 'Ferrant E', 'Pages PB', 'Plocque A', 'Estivalet L', 'Valot S', 'Dalle F', 'Abou Hanna H', 'Chretien ML']","[""Service d'hematologie clinique, hopital Francois-Mitterrand, CHU de Dijon, 14, rue Gaffarel, 21079 Dijon cedex, France; Inserm unite 866, LabEx Team, faculte de medecine, 21079 Dijon, France.

However, many patients may have severe acute or late therapeutic side effects, and the survival rate in some groups (e.g., patients with MLL rearrangements, hypodiploidy, IKZF1 mutation or early precursor T cell phenotype) is far behind the average. Innovative strategies in medical attendance provide better clinical outcomes for them: complete gene diagnostics, molecularly targeted anticancer treatment, immuno-oncology and immune cell therapy. The number of genes with identified alterations in leukemic lymphoblasts is over thirty and their pathobiologic role is only partly clear. There are known patient groups where the use of specific drugs is based on gene expression profiling (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Philadelphia-like B-cell ALL). The continuous assessment of minimal residual disease became a routine due to the determination of a leukemia-associated immunophenotype by flow cytometry or a sensitive molecular marker by molecular genetics at diagnosis. Epitopes of cluster differentiation antigens on blast surface (primarily CD19, CD20 and CD22 on malignant B cells) can be attacked by monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, antitumor immunity can be strengthened utilizing either cell surface markers (bispecific T cell engagers, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy) or tumor-specific immune cells (immune checkpoint inhibitors).

Despite these advantages, WT1 has not broadly been established as a marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) due to limited patient numbers, differing sample sources, and nonstandardized in-house methods. To estimate the value of WT1 as an MRD marker, we serially quantified PB WT1 expression using a standardized European LeukemiaNet-certified assay in 59 patients with AML and MDS after allo-HSCT. We compared its performance with routine methods such as chimerism, XY-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), disease-specific cytogenetic, and molecular analyses, which were accessible in 100%, 34%, 68%, and 37%, respectively. Twenty-four patients (41%) relapsed within a median of 126 days after allo-HSCT, and 20 of them showed at least 1 elevated WT1 value above the validated cutoff. The other 35 patients (59%) remained in complete remission, and only 1 patient had a transient increase in WT1 expression. This reflects a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 97% for WT1 and appears to be favorable compared with the sensitivities and specificities observed for chimerism (33% and 91%), XY-FISH (67% and 73%), cytogenetic (33% and 77%), and molecular (78% and 85%) analyses. Further supporting its predictive impact, elevated WT1 expression prompted an earlier BM biopsy and consecutively the diagnosis of relapse in 62% of patients. The results of this real-life experience imply that PB WT1 expression is measurable by a standardized assay and predicts imminent relapse after allo-HSCT with high sensitivity and specificity in most patients with AML and MDS.","['Rautenberg, Christina', 'Pechtel, Sabrina', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Betz, Beate', 'Dienst, Ariane', 'Nachtkamp, Kathrin', 'Kondakci, Mustafa', 'Geyh, Stefanie', 'Wieczorek, Dagmar', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Schroeder, Thomas']","['Rautenberg C', 'Pechtel S', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Betz B', 'Dienst A', 'Nachtkamp K', 'Kondakci M', 'Geyh S', 'Wieczorek D', 'Haas R', 'Germing U', 'Kobbe G', 'Schroeder T']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, University of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.

All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vitro CDK2/cyclin E and Abl kinase inhibitory activity as well as anti-proliferative activity against K-562 (chronic myelogeneous leukemia), and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that compounds with thiophenethyl group at C-6 with mono-substituted anilines at C-4 exhibited better CDK2 inhibitory activity compared to alkyl group (thiopentane) at C-6 and di-substituted anilines at C-4 of the scaffold. In particular, compounds having 2-chloro, 3-nitro and 4-methylthio aniline groups at C-4 displayed significant enzymatic inhibitory activity against CDK2 with single digit micromolar IC50 values. The in silico molecular docking studies suggested possible binding orientation and the binding energies were in agreement with the observed SAR as well as experimental results. In addition, some of the synthesized compounds showed anti-proliferative effects against K-562 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines with IC50 values in a micromolar range. Thus, the synthesized compounds could be considered as new anticancer hits for further lead optimization.","['Cherukupalli, Srinivasulu', 'Chandrasekaran, Balakumar', 'Krystof, Vladimir', 'Aleti, Rajeshwar Reddy', 'Sayyad, Nisar', 'Merugu, Srinivas Reddy', 'Kushwaha, Narva Deshwar', 'Karpoormath, Rajshekhar']","['Cherukupalli S', 'Chandrasekaran B', 'Krystof V', 'Aleti RR', 'Sayyad N', 'Merugu SR', 'Kushwaha ND', 'Karpoormath R']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Laboratory of Growth Regulators, Centre of the Region Hana for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Palacky University & Institute of Experimental Botany ASCR, Slechtitelu 27, 78371 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban 4000, South Africa.

Although guidance is now available, patients' questions regarding this progressive concept have yet to be addressed. The overall aim of this European Steering Group is a patient-centered approach that educates patients on their treatment options, including TFR, facilitates better patient-physician relationships, and meets patients' emotional and psychological needs. The present report outlines 5 key topic areas on discontinuing tyrosine kinase therapy and the implications of TFR for patient-physician consideration: what TFR is; when TFR is appropriate; which patients might and might not be eligible for TFR; and patients' considerations for discontinuing therapy, such as tyrosine kinase withdrawal syndrome, potential psychological implications, molecular recurrence, and repeat treatment. This Steering Group advocates that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia should have access to high-quality, frequent molecular monitoring and be treated in a specialist center with appropriate medical and psychological support. As patient concerns with attempting TFR become forefront in patient-physician discussions, a greater number of eligible patients might be willing to discontinue therapy.","['Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Sharf, Giora', 'Almeida, Antonio', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Bombaci, Felice', 'Cugurovic, Jelena', 'Deekes, Nigel', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'de Jong, Jan', 'Narbutas, Sarunas', 'Westerweel, Peter', 'Zackova, Daniela']","['Saglio G', 'Sharf G', 'Almeida A', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Bombaci F', 'Cugurovic J', 'Deekes N', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'de Jong J', 'Narbutas S', 'Westerweel P', 'Zackova D']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.

Repurposing currently approved drugs or those already in clinical development to treat other indications is a more practical approach. Moreover, combinatorial therapeutics are often more efficacious than single agent therapeutics because the former can simultaneously target multiple pathways that mitigate tumor aggressiveness and induce cancer cell death. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we combined the class III antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone and the BH3 mimetic ABT-263 based on data from a prior drug screen to assess the degree of apoptotic induction in 2 human leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: The combination yielded statistically significant increases in apoptosis in both cell lines by downregulating AKT activity and increasing cleaved caspase-3. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that combining K(+) channel blockers with prosurvival Bcl-2 family inhibitors is a promising therapeutic approach in treating leukemia.","['Ketchem, Corey J', 'Kucera, Cory', 'Barve, Aditya', 'Beverly, Levi J']","['Ketchem CJ', 'Kucera C', 'Barve A', 'Beverly LJ']","['Department of Medicine, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.', 'Department of Physiology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.', 'Department of Medicine, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky; Department of Physiology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180206,United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,IM,"['Amiodarone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Combination', '*Reposition', '*Repurpose', '*Therapy']",2018/05/14 06:00,2018/12/19 06:00,['2018/05/14 06:00'],"['2017/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9629(18)30046-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.amjms.2018.01.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2018 May;355(5):488-496. doi: 10.1016/j.amjms.2018.01.011.

However, outcome data in those who are 70 years or older are limited, and no standard conditioning regimen has been established for this population. In this retrospective study we evaluated the outcome of 53 consecutive patients aged 70 years and older who underwent alloHCT with melphalan-based reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) at City of Hope. Engraftment was prompt, with median time to neutrophil engraftment of 15 days. More than 95% of patients achieved complete donor chimerism within 6 weeks from HCT, consistent with the ""semiablative"" nature of this regimen. With a median follow-up of 31.1 months, the 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 68.9%, 63.8%, and 17.0%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse at 1 and 2 years was 17.0% and 19.3%, respectively. One hundred-day cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 37.7% (grades III to IV, 18.9%), and 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 61.9% (extensive, 45.9%). The only significant predictor for poor OS was high/very high disease risk index.

Forty patients with median age 11 years (range, 1 to 19) underwent allogeneic HCT for AML in first (n = 18), second (n = 11), and third or greater remission (n = 3) or MDS (n = 8) using bone marrow (n = 25), peripheral blood stem cells (n = 5), or cord blood (n = 9). The regimen consisted of body surface area (BSA)-based treosulfan 10 g/m(2)/day (BSA </= .5 m(2)), 12 g/m(2)/day (BSA > .5 to 1.0 m(2)), or 14 g/m(2)/day (BSA > 1.0 m(2)) on days -6 to -4; fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day on days -6 to -2; and a single fraction of 200 cGy total body irradiation on day -1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included tacrolimus and methotrexate for marrow and peripheral blood stem cell and cyclosporine/mycophenolate mofetil for cord blood. One-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality were 80%, 73%, and 3%, respectively. One-year relapse was 38% for AML and 13% for MDS. No serious organ toxicities were observed. All 37 assessable patients engrafted. Cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 22% and 40%, respectively. BSA-based treosulfan dosing resulted in predictable area under the curve and maximum concentration, which is required for dosing without measuring individual pharmacokinetic parameters. Observed differences in pharmacokinetics did not impact disease control or regimen toxicity. This BSA-based treosulfan regimen resulted in excellent engraftment and disease-free survival and minimal toxicity and transplant-related mortality (3%) in children and young adults with AML and MDS.","['Nemecek, Eneida R', 'Hilger, Ralf A', 'Adams, Alexia', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Kiefer, Deidre', 'Le-Rademacher, Jennifer', 'Levine, John E', 'Yanik, Gregory', 'Leung, Wing', 'Talano, Julie-An', 'Haut, Paul', 'Delgado, David', 'Kapoor, Neena', 'Petrovic, Aleksandra', 'Adams, Roberta', 'Hanna, Rabi', 'Rangarajan, Hemalatha', 'Dalal, Jignesh', 'Chewning, Joseph', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Epstein, Stacy', 'Burroughs, Lauri', 'Perez-Albuerne, Evelio D', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Delaney, Colleen']","['Nemecek ER', 'Hilger RA', 'Adams A', 'Shaw BE', 'Kiefer D', 'Le-Rademacher J', 'Levine JE', 'Yanik G', 'Leung W', 'Talano JA', 'Haut P', 'Delgado D', 'Kapoor N', 'Petrovic A', 'Adams R', 'Hanna R', 'Rangarajan H', 'Dalal J', 'Chewning J', 'Verneris MR', 'Epstein S', 'Burroughs L', 'Perez-Albuerne ED', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Delaney C']","[""Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.

Multi-classification on the gene expression data of acute leukemia is help for diagnosing it which contains B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, selecting cancer-causing genes is a challenging problem in performing multi-classification. In this paper, weighted gene co-expression networks are employed to divide the genes into groups. Based on the dividing groups, a new regularized multinomial regression with overlapping group lasso penalty (MROGL) has been presented to simultaneously perform multi-classification and select gene groups. By implementing this method on three-class acute leukemia data, the grouped genes which work synergistically are identified, and the overlapped genes shared by different groups are also highlighted. Moreover, MROGL outperforms other five methods on multi-classification accuracy.","['Li, Juntao', 'Wang, Yanyan', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Xiao, Huimin', 'Song, Xuekun']","['Li J', 'Wang Y', 'Jiang T', 'Xiao H', 'Song X']","['School of Mathematics and Information Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China.', 'School of Mathematics and Information Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang 453007, China.

Western blots were performed to assess the expression of autophagy proteins. Changes in the LC3 distribution were monitored by immunofluorescence assays together with western blots, and the expression levels of Sirt1, DOR, Beclin1, HMGB1, and AMPK mRNA were detected via fluorescent quantitative PCR. The effects of Sirt1 and DOR on cell proliferation and survival were analyzed by MTT, flow cytometry, and western blotting assays. We found that treating AML cells with Ara-c or Sorafenib resulted in autophagy enhancement, and when autophagy was enhanced, nuclear LC3 moved into the cytoplasm. Notably, when autophagy was inhibited by blocking the nuclear LC3 shift, the cytotoxicity of drugs was enhanced. Our results also identified Sirt1 and DOR as regulatory molecules for the observed nuclear LC3 shift, and these molecules further affected the expression of Beclin1, HMGB1, and AMPK. Our results suggest the distribution of nuclear LC3 can be a novel way for further studying death of AML cells,and the regulatory molecules may be new targets for treating AML.","['Guo, Wenjian', 'Jin, Jingrui', 'Pan, Jiajia', 'Yao, Rongxing', 'Li, Xia', 'Huang, Xin', 'Ma, Zhixing', 'Huang, Sujuan', 'Yan, Xiao', 'Jin, Jie', 'Dong, Aishu']","['Guo W', 'Jin J', 'Pan J', 'Yao R', 'Li X', 'Huang X', 'Ma Z', 'Huang S', 'Yan X', 'Jin J', 'Dong A']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, PR China; Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, PR China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, PR China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, PR China; Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.

METHODS: A total of 171 consecutive patients who were diagnosed and treated as refractory germ cell tumor and had records of detailed chemotherapy doses between April 1998 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Four testicular tumor patients (4/171, 2.3%) developed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Three of them were affected after complete remission of the primary testicular tumor. A median time interval from a start of chemotherapy to a secondary tumor development was 6.8 years (range 3.7-11.5 years). The median total dose of etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin and nedaplatin were 3640 mg/m(2) (range 2906-4000 mg/m(2) ), 42.7 g (range 19.5-54.0 g), 1100 mg/m(2) (range 600-1500 mg/m(2) ) and 500 mg/m(2) (range 300-1600 mg/m(2) ), respectively. Etoposide had the only significant relationship between a cumulative dose and leukemogenesis in univariate analysis (P < 0.05). One patient had complete remission, but the other three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show that refractory germ cell tumor patients have an increased risk of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. A cumulative dose of etoposide is a significant risk of leukemogenesis. As therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome has a poor prognosis, close follow up is required for refractory germ cell tumor patients.","['Inoue, Yuta', 'Nakamura, Terukazu', 'Nakanishi, Hiroyuki', 'Oishi, Masakatsu', 'Hongo, Fumiya', 'Okihara, Koji', 'Mizutani, Shinsuke', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Ukimura, Osamu']","['Inoue Y', 'Nakamura T', 'Nakanishi H', 'Oishi M', 'Hongo F', 'Okihara K', 'Mizutani S', 'Kuroda J', 'Ukimura O']","['Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Saiseikai Suita Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto Chubu Medical Center, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180511,Australia,Int J Urol,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,9440237,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*extragonadal tumor', '*leukemogenesis', '*refractory germ cell tumor', '*testicular tumor', '*therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome']",2018/05/13 06:00,2019/05/23 06:00,['2018/05/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/iju.13597 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Urol. 2018 Jul;25(7):678-683. doi: 10.1111/iju.13597.

The tumor volume and mass of each group of nude mice were measured and the anti-tumor rates of TSRP were calculated subsequently. The apoptosis status of tumor cells was detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining analysis. Finally, the activities of apoptosis related signaling of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) were determined with immunohistochemistry tests. RESULTS: Subcutaneous injection of K562 cells induced tumor formation in nude mice, and the TSRP treated group showed a signifificant inhibitory effect on tumor formation. The nude mice treated with TSRP showed a signifificant decrease in tumor growth rate and tumor weight in comparison to the control group (all P<0.05). The HE staining and TUNEL assay showed that TSRP induced cell death by apoptosis. The immunohistochemical assay showed down-regulation of the bcl-2 gene in the TSRP treated cells. The phosphorylation levels of eIF4E and STAT3 were decreased obviously after the treatment of TSRP. CONCLUSION: TSRP had an excellent tumor-suppressing effect on K562 cells in the nude mice xenograft model, suggesting that TSPR can be developed as a promising anti-chronic myeloide leukemia drug.","['Xu, Xiao-Feng', 'Cheng, Ru-Bin', 'Zhang, Xue-Jin', 'Gao, Rui-Lan']","['Xu XF', 'Cheng RB', 'Zhang XJ', 'Gao RL']","['Department of Hematology, Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Hangzhou, 310003, China. hhxuxiaofeng@126.com.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310006, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180511,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Rubus/chemistry', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'eukaryotic initiation factor 4E', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3', 'total saponins of Rubus parvifolius L.', 'xenograft model']",2018/05/13 06:00,2019/06/01 06:00,['2018/05/13 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11655-018-2563-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11655-018-2563-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2018 Dec;24(12):920-924. doi: 10.1007/s11655-018-2563-8.

It is caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene and is typically diagnosed by sequencing this gene in blood cells. The presence of a mutation in approximately half of the DNA reads (allelic fraction of 50%) is an indicator of a germline mutation, such as that in LFS. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an expansion of a hematopoietic clone containing a somatic driver mutation with a low allelic fraction, usually not more than 10% to 20%. This report presents a patient with fallopian tube carcinoma who underwent multigene panel testing for cancer predisposition and was found to have a mutation in the TP53 gene, c.733G>T (p.Gly245Cys). Since the TP53 mutation had an allelic fraction of approximately 50%, it was interpreted as being germline, and the patient was diagnosed as having LFS. A year later, she developed acute myelogenous leukemia. Subsequent mutational analysis showed that the TP53 mutation was absent in her benign tissue sample but present in leukemic cells. Furthermore, sequencing of the fallopian tube tumor tissue revealed a different TP53 gene mutation, c.818G>T (p.Arg273Leu). These observations confirmed that the previously identified mutation in her blood was somatic rather than germline and that she had CH at the time of genetic testing. CH can occasionally lead to a misdiagnosis of a germline mutation and a cancer predisposition syndrome that has significant implications for patients and their families. Therefore, the abnormal result of genetic testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility should be carefully interpreted when the clinical presentation is atypical, when the patient is older, when the gene in question is known to have potential germline and somatic mutations such as the TP53 gene, and when the allelic fraction is approximately 50%.","['Mitchell, Rachel L', 'Kosche, Cory', 'Burgess, Kelly', 'Wadhwa, Shreya', 'Buckingham, Lela', 'Ghai, Ritu', 'Rotmensch, Jacob', 'Klapko, Oleksandra', 'Usha, Lydia']","['Mitchell RL', 'Kosche C', 'Burgess K', 'Wadhwa S', 'Buckingham L', 'Ghai R', 'Rotmensch J', 'Klapko O', 'Usha L']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Mutation']",,,2018/05/13 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2018/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.6004/jnccn.2017.7058 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2018 May;16(5):461-466. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.7058.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,['J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2018 Sep;16(9):1032-1033.

To understand the epigenetic alterations induced by helminth coinfections, we evaluated the longitudinal effect of ascariasis and schistosomiasis infection on CD4(+) T cell DNA methylation and the downstream tuberculosis (TB)-specific and bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced immune phenotype. All experiments were performed on human primary immune cells from a longitudinal cohort of recently TB-exposed children. Compared with age-matched uninfected controls, children with active Schistosoma haematobium and Ascaris lumbricoides infection had 751 differentially DNA-methylated genes, with 72% hypermethylated. Gene ontology pathway analysis identified inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling, cellular proliferation, and the Th1 pathway. Targeted real-time quantitative PCR after methyl-specific endonuclease digestion confirmed DNA hypermethylation of the transcription factors BATF3, ID2, STAT5A, IRF5, PPARg, RUNX2, IRF4, and NFATC1 and cytokines or cytokine receptors IFNGR1, TNFS11, RELT (TNF receptor), IL12RB2, and IL12B (p < 0.001; Sidak-Bonferroni). Functional blockage of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway was confirmed, with helminth-infected individuals having decreased upregulation of IFN-gamma-inducible genes (Mann-Whitney p < 0.05). Hypomethylation of the IL-4 pathway and DNA hypermethylation of the Th1 pathway was confirmed by Ag-specific multidimensional flow cytometry demonstrating decreased TB-specific IFN-gamma and TNF and increased IL-4 production by CD4+ T cells (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.05). In S. haematobium-infected individuals, these DNA methylation and immune phenotypic changes persisted at least 6 mo after successful deworming. This work demonstrates that helminth infection induces DNA methylation and immune perturbations that inhibit TB-specific immune control and that the duration of these changes are helminth specific.","['DiNardo, Andrew R', 'Nishiguchi, Tomoki', 'Mace, Emily M', 'Rajapakshe, Kimal', 'Mtetwa, Godwin', 'Kay, Alexander', 'Maphalala, Gugu', 'Secor, W Evan', 'Mejia, Rojelio', 'Orange, Jordan S', 'Coarfa, Cristian', 'Bhalla, Kapil N', 'Graviss, Edward A', 'Mandalakas, Anna M', 'Makedonas, George']","['DiNardo AR', 'Nishiguchi T', 'Mace EM', 'Rajapakshe K', 'Mtetwa G', 'Kay A', 'Maphalala G', 'Secor WE', 'Mejia R', 'Orange JS', 'Coarfa C', 'Bhalla KN', 'Graviss EA', 'Mandalakas AM', 'Makedonas G']","[""The Global Tuberculosis Program, Immigrant and Global Health, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030; Andrew.DiNardo@bcm.edu."", ""The Global Tuberculosis Program, Immigrant and Global Health, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030."", 'Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', ""Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030."", 'Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', ""Baylor-Swaziland Children's Foundation, Mbabane H100, Swaziland."", ""Baylor-Swaziland Children's Foundation, Mbabane H100, Swaziland."", 'Ministry of Health, Mbabane H100, Swaziland.', 'Parasitic Diseases Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333.', ""Department of Pediatrics, National School of Tropical Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Houston, TX 77030."", 'Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', ""Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030."", 'Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030.', ""The Global Tuberculosis Program, Immigrant and Global Health, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030."", 'Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', ""Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180511,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascariasis/*immunology', 'Ascaris lumbricoides/*immunology', 'BCG Vaccine/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Schistosoma haematobium/*immunology', 'Schistosomiasis/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tuberculosis/immunology']",,,2018/05/13 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/05/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800101 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800101 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Jul 1;201(1):124-133. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800101.

Paradoxically, these vesicles have been reported to also possess fibrinolytic activity. To determine whether thrombotic or fibrinolytic activity is a predominant characteristic of these extracellular vesicles, we prepared exosomes and MVs from 2 breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF7), a lung cancer cell line (A549), and a leukemia cell line (NB4) and assayed their thrombotic and fibrinolytic activities. We observed that thrombotic activity was a common feature of MVs but not exosomes. Exosomes and/or MVs from several cell lines, with the exception of the A549 cell line, displayed fibrinolytic activity toward a pure fibrin clot, but only exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells could degrade a fibrin clot formed in plasma. Increasing the malignant potential of MCF7 cells decreased the thrombotic activity of their MVs but did not alter their fibrinolytic activity. Decreasing the malignant potential of NB4 cells did not alter the thrombotic or fibrinolytic activity of their MVs or exosomes. Finally, the incubation of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes with A549 cells increased plasmin generation by these cells. Our data indicate that MVs generally have thrombotic activity, whereas thrombotic activity is not commonly observed for exosomes. Furthermore, exosomes and MVs generally do not display fibrinolytic activity under physiological conditions.","['Durrieu, Ludovic', 'Bharadwaj, Alamelu', 'Waisman, David M']","['Durrieu L', 'Bharadwaj A', 'Waisman DM']","['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission/*methods', 'Thrombosis/*physiopathology']",,,2018/05/13 06:00,2019/03/29 06:00,['2018/05/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017015479 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015479 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 May 22;2(10):1054-1065. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015479.,,,PMC5965050,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with NK/T-cell neoplasms diagnosed from 2001 to 2014 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the overall survival difference among the subgroups. Multivariate analyses were used to determine the factors affecting survival. RESULTS: For the 797 patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, the median age at diagnosis was 53 years, and males tended to be younger at diagnosis (P < .0001). The incidence of the disease increased from 0.4 in 2001 to 0.8 in 2014 per 1,000,000 individuals. The incidence was significantly greater in Hispanic patients compared with that in non-Hispanic patients (rate ratio, 3.03; P = .0001). The median overall survival was 20 months (range, 2-73 months) and varied significantly according to the primary site (P < .0001) and the disease stage at diagnosis (P < .0001). NK/T-cell lymphoma patients had an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (standardized incidence ratio, 18.77; 95% confidence interval, 2.27-67.81). For the 105 NK/T-cell leukemia patients, the median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range, 4-95 years). The overall incidence of the disease was 0.09 per 1,000,000 individuals and was significantly greater in males (rate ratio, 0.41; P < .0001). Unlike NK/T-cell lymphoma, no racial disparities were found in the incidence. The median overall survival was 17 months (range, 0-36 months). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, in the United States has at least doubled in the past decade, with the greatest predilection among Hispanics. Patients with NK/T-cell lymphoma might have an increased risk of the subsequent development of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Kommalapati, Anuhya', 'Tella, Sri Harsha', 'Ganti, Apar Kishore', 'Armitage, James O']","['Kommalapati A', 'Tella SH', 'Ganti AK', 'Armitage JO']","['Department of Medicine, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, SC.

The acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) drug arsenic trioxide (As2O3), causes hepatotoxicity. We evaluated the protective potential of DHA as pre/combination/post-administration patterns against As2O3 induced toxicity. The therapeutic concentration of As2O3 (10muM) resulted in cytotoxicity with a significant (p<0.05) variation from the control group. Reduced cell viability, morphological alterations, enhanced LDH release and apoptosis were observed. The oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and ROS) and hepatic enzymes (AST and ALT) and intracellular calcium levels were found to be elevated by the As2O3 administration. Reduction in levels of mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular free radical scavenging potential, intracellular proteins, ATPases and major antioxidants (catalase, SOD, GSH, and GPx) were also observed. Administration of DHA along with As2O3 as pre/combination administration patterns offered protection against As2O3 induced cytotoxicity at significant levels (p<0.05) from As2O3 alone treated group. The cell viability and morphology were protected with reduced LDH release and apoptosis. The hepatic enzymes and oxidative stress markers were reduced with replenishment of mitochondrial membrane potential, free radical scavenging potential, intracellular proteins, ATPases and antioxidant levels.

There was not a valid evaluation system to predict the most proper donor. HistoCheck was based on the functional similarity of amino acids to estimate the allogenicity of HLA mismatches with a sequence similarity matching (SSM) score. We investigated whether HistoCheck could predict clinical outcomes in 500 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving haplo-HSCT. The total SSM score of the 5 loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1) had no association with clinical outcomes. HLA-C SSM score was significantly associated with transplant-related mortality (TRM) (hazard ratio [HR], .in691; 95% confidence interval [CI], .520 to .917; P = .011), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, .714; 95% CI, .586 to .869; P = .001), and overall survival (OS) (HR, .711; 95% CI, .574 to .881; P = .002) by multivariate analysis. No significant associations were observed between other single-locus SSM score and clinical outcomes. In summary, our data demonstrate that a high HLA-C HistoCheck SSM score may lead to lower TRM and improved DFS and OS after haplo-HSCT and inclusion of HLA-C HistoCheck in donor selection criteria may need to be further confirmed in prospective studies.","['Huo, Ming-Rui', 'Li, Dan', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Huo MR', 'Li D', 'Chang YJ', 'Xu LP', 'Zhang XH', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.

In our search for molecules prognostic of colorectal cancer (CRC), we found high levels of LIFR in CRC tissue samples. Further analyses revealed that LIFR was indeed prognostic of CRC patient survival, and was associated with tumor size, lymphatic metastasis and stages. LIFR was found to promote tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. High levels of LIFR in CRC facilitated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, resulting in an increase in angiogenic activity. Moreover, interleukin 8 (IL-8) was found to play a role in the LIFR induced angiogenesis. IL-8 levels were correlated with LIFR levels in CRC tissues, whereas depletion of IL-8 led to a reduced angiogenic activity of LIFR in CRC cells. In addition, LIFR increased phosphorylation level of Erk, which regulates il-8 transcription. We conclude that LIFR is possibly a valuable prognostic marker for CRC. Our results also implicate a mechanism by which LIFR regulates tumor angiogenesis through Erk/IL-8 pathway, and that LIFR could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.","['Wu, Hao-Xuan', 'Cheng, Xi', 'Jing, Xiao-Qian', 'Ji, Xiao-Pin', 'Chen, Xian-Ze', 'Zhang, Ya-Qi', 'He, Yong-Gang', 'Liu, Kun', 'Ye, Feng', 'Sun, Han-Xing', 'Gao, Hao-Ji', 'Song, Zi-Jia', 'Wu, Huo', 'Zhang, Xiao-Jian', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Zhao, Ren']","['Wu HX', 'Cheng X', 'Jing XQ', 'Ji XP', 'Chen XZ', 'Zhang YQ', 'He YG', 'Liu K', 'Ye F', 'Sun HX', 'Gao HJ', 'Song ZJ', 'Wu H', 'Zhang XJ', 'Zhang T', 'Zhao R']","['Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; Shanghai Institute of Digestive Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.

Moving forward, new methods to quickly generate animal models that recapitulate the complex genetics of human hematological disorders are needed to transform the genetic information to new therapies. Here, we used a ribonucleoprotein-based CRISPR/Cas9 system to model human clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We edited multiple genes recurrently mutated in hematological disorders, including those encoding epigenetic regulators, transcriptional regulators, and signaling components in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Tracking the clonal dynamics by sequencing the indels induced by CRISPR/Cas9 revealed clonal expansion in some recipient mice that progressed to AML initiated by leukemia-initiating cells. Our results establish that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiplex mutagenesis can be used to engineer a variety of murine models of hematological malignancies with complex genetic architectures seen in human disease.","['Shi, Xiangguo', 'Kitano, Ayumi', 'Jiang, Yajian', 'Luu, Victor', 'Hoegenauer, Kevin A', 'Nakada, Daisuke']","['Shi X', 'Kitano A', 'Jiang Y', 'Luu V', 'Hoegenauer KA', 'Nakada D']","['Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.

Resistance to cytarabine and anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure. Thus, finding new drugs with anti-leukemia activities and minimal side effect is urgently needed. Here through screening more than 1000 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of United States, the anthelmintic drug mebendazole (MBZ) was found to inhibit the growth of AML cell lines (THP-1, U937, NB4 and K562) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) from AML patients at pharmacologically achievable concentrations. In contrast, similar concentration of MBZ had little inhibitory effect on the growth of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In addition, MBZ induced mitotic arrest and mitotic catastrophe in AML cells based on nuclear morphology, cell cycle distribution, mitotic marker analyses and the number of multinucleated cells and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, MBZ treatment inhibited activation of Akt and Erk in AML leukemic cells. Finally, MBZ repressed the progression of leukemic cells in vivo and prolonged survival in AML xenograft mouse model. Taken together, our results suggest that MBZ could be a potential new therapeutic agent for the treatment of AML patients.","['He, Licai', 'Shi, Liuzhi', 'Du, Zhuanyun', 'Huang, He', 'Gong, Rui', 'Ma, Lan', 'Chen, Lianjuan', 'Gao, Shenmeng', 'Lyu, Jianxin', 'Gu, Haihua']","['He L', 'Shi L', 'Du Z', 'Huang H', 'Gong R', 'Ma L', 'Chen L', 'Gao S', 'Lyu J', 'Gu H']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medical and Life Science, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325035, China.

In a phase I clinical trial (NCT00824135), we substituted clofarabine for fludarabine in a well-established reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for a T cell-depleted, mismatched-related (haploidentical) donor transplant backbone and explored the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine in this combination in 15 patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation for recurrent/refractory or secondary leukemia. Clofarabine was well tolerated at a dose of 50 mg/m/d for 5 days in this regimen, with minimal treatment-related mortality in a heavily pretreated group of high-risk patients. All patients exhibited quick hematopoietic recovery, with median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment being 11 and 16 days, respectively. Transient elevation of transaminases was the most common toxicity-observed in 13 patients (86.7%), with 6 (40%) grade III or above. Three patients (20%) developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Eleven patients (73.3%) died, with the most common cause of death being disease relapse (in 9 patients [60%]), followed by treatment-related mortality (in 2 patients [13.3%]). Four (26.6%) of the patients are long-term survivors.","['Sharma, Akshay', 'Kang, Guolian', 'Sunkara, Anusha', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Cross, Shane J', 'Geiger, Terrence', 'Triplett, Brandon']","['Sharma A', 'Kang G', 'Sunkara A', 'Inaba H', 'Jeha S', 'Cross SJ', 'Geiger T', 'Triplett B']","['Departments of Oncology.', 'Hematology.', 'Biostatistics.', 'Biostatistics.', 'Departments of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Departments of Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Pathology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', ""Bone Marrow Transplant and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001222 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2018 Nov;40(8):e479-e485. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001222.,['762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)'],,PMC6197927,,,['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NIHMS962886'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only few reports have dealt with IGTNs in the above setting. PROCEDURE: Between August 2007 and July 2017, 180 children who received treatment for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors at our institute were enrolled in this study. Twelve patients with insufficient data and 7 patients with past histories of IGTNs were excluded. A total of 161 patients were analyzed. Median age at admission was 7.9 years (range, 1.0 to 25.4 y), with 92 males and 69 females. Diagnoses were hematologic diseases in 128 patients, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 75 patients, and solid tumors in 33 patients. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (13.7%) suffered from IGTNs (or toe paronychia) during hospitalization. Multivariable analysis disclosed a strong correlation between the occurrence of IGTNs and older age (over 9.0 y) and ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-related factors, such as age over 9 years and ALL were associated with IGTNs. This is the first report of a survey on IGTNs in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors hospitalized for chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.","['Hori, Daiki', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Suzuki, Daisuke', 'Sano, Hirozumi', 'Kobayashi, Kunihiko']","['Hori D', 'Kobayashi R', 'Suzuki D', 'Sano H', 'Kobayashi K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology for Children and Adolescents, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Nails', 'Nails, Ingrown/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001211 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Mar;41(2):e108-e110. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001211.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science were extensively searched without language restriction. Data was extracted in a standardized data collection sheet after two reviewers scanned studies independently. The association between sCD23 and NHL was indicated as odds ratio (OR) along with its related 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Meta-analysis was conducted via RevMan 5.3. A total of five studies, which included 964 B-NHL patients and 1243 matched controls without B-NHL, among which 257 were HIV-positive donors and 986 were general controls, were included in our study. Meta-analysis revealed a significant association between peripheral sCD23 level and B-NHL in HIV-positive samples (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25, 2.20; P = 0.0005) as well as the general population (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.71, 3.86; P < 0.00001). Meta-analysis, stratified by sampling time prior to diagnosis, indicated potential HIV-NHL patients are 2.34-folds more likely to have higher blood sCD23 level, although this association is statistically meaningful only during 3-5 years prior to diagnosis (95% CI 1.27, 4.33). Subgroup analysis based on B-NHL type demonstrated a significant association between sCD23 level and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). The findings of our study indicate a positive association of circulating sCD23 level and B-NHL risks and highlight the possibility of sCD23 as a predictive marker of B-NHL. However, to better understand the underlying mechanism, further studies are needed.","['Huang, Yi-Shu', 'Zhou, Xiang', 'Yang, Zhi-Fang', 'Lv, Zheng-Tao']","['Huang YS', 'Zhou X', 'Yang ZF', 'Lv ZT']","['Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, Hubei, China.', 'Medical Faculty Heidelberg, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Thyroid and Breast Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, Hubei, China. yangzhifangtj@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, Hubei, China. 630105736@qq.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20180511,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Female', 'HIV Infections/*blood', '*HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Receptors, IgE/*blood', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Meta-analysis', ""Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas"", 'Soluble CD23']",2018/05/12 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3349-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3349-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Aug;97(8):1317-1325. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3349-y.

However, pre-existing immunity against measles might be a hurdle for OMV therapy. Methods: OMV was inactivated with short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UV-C). Loss of replication and oncolytic activity of UV-inactivated OMV were confirmed by tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) assay using Vero cells and by flow cytometry using Jurkat cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to verify that UV-inactivated OMV remained antigenic. Different doses of UV-inactivated OMV were pre-cultured in media supplemented with measles immune serum. The mixture was transferred to Jurkat cells and active OMV was added. Active OMV-induced death of Jurkat cells was monitored by flow cytometry. Results: UV-inactivation abrogates OMV replication while maintaining its antigenicity. UV-inactivated OMV sequesters pre-existing anti-MV antibodies in Jurkat cell culture, thereby protecting active OMV from neutralization and preserving oncolytic activity. Conclusion: We prove the principle that a non-replicating OMV can serve as a ""decoy"" for neutralizing anti-MV antibodies, thereby allowing antitumor activity of OMV.","['Xu, Chun', 'Goss, Annika Verena', 'Dorneburg, Carmen', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Wei, Jiwu', 'Beltinger, Christian']","['Xu C', 'Goss AV', 'Dorneburg C', 'Debatin KM', 'Wei J', 'Beltinger C']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Section of Experimental Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Medical School of Nanjing University, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Section of Experimental Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Section of Experimental Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Section of Experimental Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Medical School of Nanjing University, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Section of Experimental Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180430,New Zealand,Oncolytic Virother,Oncolytic virotherapy,101629828,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'anti-measles antibodies', 'decoy for anti-measles antibodies', 'oncolytic measles virus']",2018/05/12 06:00,2018/05/12 06:01,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OV.S150637 [doi]', 'ov-7-037 [pii]']",epublish,Oncolytic Virother. 2018 Apr 30;7:37-41. doi: 10.2147/OV.S150637. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5933358,,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, a novel cell culture technology is reported for expanding primary human T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. T cells are suspended and cultured in microscale alginate hydrogel tubes (AlgTubes) that are suspended in the cell culture medium in a culture vessel. The hydrogel tubes protect cells from hydrodynamic stresses and confine the cell mass less than 400 microm (in radial diameter) to ensure efficient mass transport, creating a cell-friendly microenvironment for growing T cells. This system is simple, scalable, highly efficient, defined, cost-effective, and compatible with current good manufacturing practices. Under optimized culture conditions, the AlgTubes enable culturing T cells with high cell viability, low DNA damage, high growth rate ( approximately 320-fold expansion over 14 days), high purity ( approximately 98% CD3+), and high yield ( approximately 3.2 x 10(8) cells mL(-1) hydrogel). All offer considerable advantages compared to current T cell culturing approaches.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the miRNA expression pattern that may be related to BCL11B regulation in T-ALL. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the miRNAs miR-17-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-29c-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-214-3p and miR-214-5p, the BCL11B expression level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells which was obtained from 17 de novo and untreated T-ALL patients, and 15 healthy individuals (HIs) served as control. Correlations between the relative miRNA expression levels and BCL11B were analyzed. RESULTS: Based on the computational prediction that certain miRNAs bind the BCL11B 3'-UTR, miR-17-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-29c-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-214-3p and miR-214-5p were found to be candidates for regulating BCL11B. The expression levels of the six miRNAs were decreased compared with HIs, and with the exception of miR-17-5p, statistically significant differences in expression levels were found in the T-ALL group. Moreover, while significantly higher BCL11B expression was found in the T-ALL group, a negative trend in the correlation level for all six miRNAs could be found in all groups; however, statistical significance was only found for miR-214-3p in the T-ALL group. CONCLUSION: miRNA downregulation together with BCL11B upregulation suggests that miR-17, miR-29c, miR-92a and miR-214 might be involved in BCL11B regulation. The therapeutic promise of regulating the expression of these miRNAs for T-ALL therapy may be considered in the future.","['He, Zifan', 'Liao, Ziwei', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Bo', 'Yu, Zhi', 'Luo, Gengxin', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['He Z', 'Liao Z', 'Chen S', 'Li B', 'Yu Z', 'Luo G', 'Yang L', 'Zeng C', 'Li Y']","['Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180511,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11B', 'T-ALL', 'miR-17', 'miR-214', 'miR-29c', 'miR-92a']",2018/05/12 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12979 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2018 Oct;14(5):e259-e265. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12979.

As a member of the Hsps, Hsp90 is involved in protein posttranslational maturation and disposition. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in normal cells. However, in cancer cells and particularly in hematological malignancies, Hsp90 is unexpectedly abundant to maintain levels of proteins vital for cancer pathology. Hsp90 inhibitors can target the ATP domain of Hsp90 and prohibit its exchange of ADP for ATP, leading to the degradation of client proteins and disruption of signaling cascades. Concomitantly, Hsp90 inhibitors induce tumor cell apoptosis, promote cell cycle arrest and abrogate microenvironmentderived cytoprotection. Geldanamycin, a benzoquinone antineoplastic antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus, and its derivative, 17AAG, were first developed as Hsp90 inhibitors and exhibited effective anticancer potency. Whereas, severe side effects and low solubility restricted their application at the clinical level, BIIB021, a novel and fully synthetic inhibitor of Hsp90, is water soluble and welltolerated. Beyond degrading oncogenic protein, BIIB021 can overcome multidrug resistance and potentiate the effects of other therapeutics. phase I/II trials have been conducted to evaluate the dosing schedules and activity of this agent. The present review focuses on the antitumor profile of BIIB021.

Accumulating evidence indicates that abnormal apoptosis promotes the evolution and progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). As a novel cancer-testis antigen, spermassociated antigen 6 (SPAG6) has been reported to regulate apoptosis through the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand signaling pathway in the MDS cell line SKM1. However, the mechanism of the intrinsic cell death pathway for apoptosis induction by SPAG6 silencing is unclear. In the present study, the in vitro effects of SPAG6 silencing were investigated in SKM1 cells through extensive biochemical and molecular approaches. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of SPAG6 and activation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT signal pathway. Additionally, SKM1 cells transduced with SPAG6 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus were treated with the phosphatidylionositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or pan caspase inhibitor zVADfmk and the apoptosis rates were measured by flow cytometry, and the expressions of associated proteins were examined by western blot analysis. A mouse xenograft model was also used to further evaluate the effects of SPAG6 knockdown on inducing tumor apoptosis in vivo. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of SPAG6 in SKM1 cells increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression and reduced protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, which in turn resulted in cell apoptosis as evidenced by induced myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein Mcl1 downregulation, cytochrome c release and increased caspase9 expression. Consistently, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 synergistically enhanced apoptosis of SKM1 cells when co-administered with SPAG6 shRNA lentivirus. Furthermore, treatment with the pan caspase inhibitor zVADfmk failed to prevent PTEN activation upon SPAG6 knockdown, suggesting that SPAG6-regulated PTEN expression was caspase activation-independent. In addition, SPAG6 knockdown was associated with DNMT1 downregulation, implying that SPAG6 may indirectly control PTEN expression via DNA methylation. Furthermore, tumor tissues from nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice inoculated with SPAG6-shRNA lentivirus pre-infected SKM1 cells exhibited significantly elevated apoptosis in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. These results demonstrate that SPAG6 silencing induces PTEN expression to regulate apoptosis though the PI3K/AKT pathway, indicating that SPAG6 may be a potential therapeutic target for MDS.","['Yin, Jiaxiu', 'Li, Xinxin', 'Zhang, Zaili', 'Luo, Xiaohua', 'Wang, Li', 'Liu, Lin']","['Yin J', 'Li X', 'Zhang Z', 'Luo X', 'Wang L', 'Liu L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

Patients received six 28-day cycles (C) of G-B: obinutuzumab day (D)1/D2 of C1 (25 mg D1/975 mg D2), 1000 mg D8 and D15 of C1, and D1 of C2-6; and bendamustine 70/90 mg/m(2) D1 and D2 of C1-6. The primary endpoint was safety/tolerability. Grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 82.3% of patients, including neutropenia (49.4%), thrombocytopenia (12.0%) and febrile neutropenia (10.8%). Serious AEs included neutropenia (12.7%), febrile neutropenia (9.5%) and pneumonia (7.6%). Rates of grade >/=3 infections and infusion-related reactions were 20.3% and 17.1%, respectively. Due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS; 8.2%), including two associated fatalities (one in another study cohort), additional risk-minimization measures were implemented. Overall response rate was 81.0%. After 32.8 months' median observation time, 2-year progression-free survival was 81.8%. Minimal residual disease was undetectable in 59.5% (94/158) and 27.8% (44/158) of patients for blood and bone marrow, respectively. Frontline G-B appears to have manageable toxicity with clinical activity in CLL. Careful TLS risk assessment, pretreatment and monitoring is required.","['Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Foa, Robin', 'Bottcher, Sebastian', 'Ilhan, Osman', 'Knauf, Wolfgang', 'Mikuskova, Eva', 'Renner, Christoph', 'Tausch, Eugen', 'Woszczyk, Dariusz', 'Gresko, Ekaterina', 'Lundberg, Linda', 'Moore, Tom', 'Morris, Thea', 'Robson, Susan', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Leblond V', 'Foa R', 'Bottcher S', 'Ilhan O', 'Knauf W', 'Mikuskova E', 'Renner C', 'Tausch E', 'Woszczyk D', 'Gresko E', 'Lundberg L', 'Moore T', 'Morris T', 'Robson S', 'Bosch F']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.

The mechanisms altering TNF responsiveness in MF cells are unknown. We show that the proportion of marrow (BM) cells expressing TNF is increased in MF compared to controls, with the largest differential in primitive cells. Blockade of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), but not TNFR1, selectively inhibited colony formation by MF CD34(+) and mouse JAK2(V617F) progenitor cells. Microarray of mouse MPN revealed reduced expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (Xiap) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (Mapk8) in JAK2(V617F) relative to JAK2(WT) cells, which were normalized by TNFR2 but not TNFR1 blockade. XIAP and MAPK8 were also reduced in MF CD34(+) cells compared to normal BM, and their ectopic expression induced apoptosis. Unlike XIAP, expression of cellular IAP (cIAP) protein was increased in MF CD34(+) cells. Consistent with cIAP's role in NF-kappaB activation, TNF-induced NF-kappaB activity was higher in MF vs. normal BM CD34(+) cells. This suggests that JAK2(V617F) reprograms TNF response toward survival by downregulating XIAP and MAPK8 through TNFR2.

DKC can occur as a late-onset, so-called cryptic form, with first manifestation in adults. Somatic MDS-related mutations are found in up to 35% of patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AA), especially in patients with short telomeres. The aim of our study was to investigate whether cryptic DKC is associated with an increased incidence of MDS-related somatic mutations, thereby linking the accelerated telomere shortening with the increased risk of MDS/AML. Samples from 15 adult patients (median age: 42 years, range: 23-60 years) with molecularly confirmed cryptic DKC were screened using next-generation gene panel sequencing to detect MDS-related somatic variants. Only one of the 15 patients (7%) demonstrated a clinically relevant MDS-related somatic variant. This incidence was dramatically lower than formerly described in acquired AA. Based on our data, we conclude that clonal evolution of subclones carrying MDS-related mutations is not the predominant mechanism for MDS/AML initiation in adult cryptic DKC patients.","['Kirschner, Martin', 'Maurer, Angela', 'Wlodarski, Marcin W', 'Ventura Ferreira, Monica S', 'Bouillon, Anne-Sophie', 'Halfmeyer, Insa', 'Blau, Wolfgang', 'Kreuter, Michael', 'Rosewich, Martin', 'Corbacioglu, Selim', 'Beck, Joachim', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Bittenbring, Jorg', 'Radsak, Markus P', 'Wilk, Christian Matthias', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Begemann, Matthias', 'Kurth, Ingo', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Beier, Fabian']","['Kirschner M', 'Maurer A', 'Wlodarski MW', 'Ventura Ferreira MS', 'Bouillon AS', 'Halfmeyer I', 'Blau W', 'Kreuter M', 'Rosewich M', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Beck J', 'Schwarz M', 'Bittenbring J', 'Radsak MP', 'Wilk CM', 'Koschmieder S', 'Begemann M', 'Kurth I', 'Schemionek M', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Beier F']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Pneumology and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Paediatric Pulmonology, Allergy and Cystic Fibrosis, Children's Hospital, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, & Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Charite, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Saarland, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology, & Pneumology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. fbeier@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180402,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Telomere Shortening/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0125-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0125-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Aug;32(8):1762-1767. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0125-x.

Here we have studied the lincRNA profile and their clinical impact in MM. We performed RNA-seq on MM cells from 308 newly diagnosed and uniformly treated patients, 16 normal plasma cells and utilized RNA-seq data from 532 newly diagnosed patients from CoMMpass study to analyze for lincRNAs. We observed 869 differentially expressed lincRNAs in MM compared to normal plasma cells. We identified 14 lincRNAs associated with PFS and calculated a risk score to stratify patients. The median PFS between high vs low-risk groups was 17 months vs not-reached (NR); and OS 30 months vs NR, respectively (p < 0.0001 for both). In the independent validation dataset between high and low-risk groups, PFS was 27 vs 42 months (HR 2.06 [1.44-2.96]; p < 0.0005); and 4-year OS 62% vs 86% (HR 2.76 [1.51-5.05]; p < 0.0005) confirming significant clinical relevance of lincRNA in MM. Importantly, lincRNA signature was able to further identify patients with significant differential outcomes within each low and high-risk categories identified using standard risk categorization including cytogenetic/FISH, ISS, and MRD negative or positive. Our results suggest that lincRNAs have an independent effect on MM outcome and provide a rationale to evaluate its molecular and biological impact.","['Samur, Mehmet Kemal', 'Minvielle, Stephane', 'Gulla, Annamaria', 'Fulciniti, Mariateresa', 'Cleynen, Alice', 'Aktas Samur, Anil', 'Szalat, Raphael', 'Shammas, Masood', 'Magrangeas, Florence', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu', 'Auclair, Daniel', 'Keats, Jonathan', 'Richardson, Paul', 'Attal, Michel', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Parmigiani, Giovanni', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Munshi, Nikhil C']","['Samur MK', 'Minvielle S', 'Gulla A', 'Fulciniti M', 'Cleynen A', 'Aktas Samur A', 'Szalat R', 'Shammas M', 'Magrangeas F', 'Tai YT', 'Auclair D', 'Keats J', 'Richardson P', 'Attal M', 'Moreau P', 'Anderson KC', 'Parmigiani G', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Munshi NC']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, Nantes, France."", 'CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, and Montpellier University, Montpellier, France.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, Nantes, France."", 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Norwalk, CT, 06851, USA.', 'The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""CRCINA, INSERM, CNRS, Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, Nantes, France."", 'CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer Oncopole, Toulouse, France. avetloiseau.herve@iuct-oncopole.fr.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. nikhil_munshi@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA, USA. nikhil_munshi@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180329,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*mortality', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0116-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0116-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Dec;32(12):2626-2635. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0116-y.

Here we show critical c-Myc-dependent activation of the Trx1 system during thymocyte and peripheral T-cell proliferation, but repression during T-cell quiescence. Deletion of thioredoxin reductase-1 (Txnrd1) prevents expansion the CD4(-)CD8(-) thymocyte population, whereas Txnrd1 deletion in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes does not affect further maturation and peripheral homeostasis of alphabetaT cells. However, Txnrd1 is critical for expansion of the activated T-cell population during viral and parasite infection. Metabolomics show that TrxR1 is essential for the last step of nucleotide biosynthesis by donating reducing equivalents to ribonucleotide reductase. Impaired availability of 2'-deoxyribonucleotides induces the DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest of Txnrd1-deficient T cells. These results uncover a pivotal function of the Trx1 system in metabolic reprogramming of thymic and peripheral T cells and provide a rationale for targeting Txnrd1 in T-cell leukemia.","['Muri, Jonathan', 'Heer, Sebastian', 'Matsushita, Mai', 'Pohlmeier, Lea', 'Tortola, Luigi', 'Fuhrer, Tobias', 'Conrad, Marcus', 'Zamboni, Nicola', 'Kisielow, Jan', 'Kopf, Manfred']","['Muri J', 'Heer S', 'Matsushita M', 'Pohlmeier L', 'Tortola L', 'Fuhrer T', 'Conrad M', 'Zamboni N', 'Kisielow J', 'Kopf M']","['Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Developmental Genetics, Helmholtz Center, Neuherberg, 85764, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.

Because such models have mostly been based on the Life Span Study cohort of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the baseline risks and survival rates in the target population should be considered when applying the cancer risk. The survival function used in the risk projection models that are commonly used in the radiological protection field to estimate the cancer risk from medical or occupational exposure is based on all-cause mortality. Thus, it may not be accurate for estimating the lifetime risk of high-incidence but not life-threatening cancer with a long-term survival rate. Herein, we present the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) estimates of all solid cancers except thyroid cancer, thyroid cancer, and leukemia except chronic lymphocytic leukemia in South Korea for lifetime exposure to 1 mGy per year using the cancer-free survival function, as recently applied in the Fukushima health risk assessment by the World Health Organization. Compared with the estimates of LARs using an overall survival function solely based on all-cause mortality, the LARs of all solid cancers except thyroid cancer, and thyroid cancer evaluated using the cancer-free survival function, decreased by approximately 13% and 1% for men and 9% and 5% for women, respectively. The LAR of leukemia except chronic lymphocytic leukemia barely changed for either gender owing to the small absolute difference between its incidence and mortality. Given that many cancers have a high curative rate and low mortality rate, using a survival function solely based on all-cause mortality may cause an overestimation of the lifetime risk of cancer incidence. The lifetime fractional risk was robust against the choice of survival function.","['Seo, Songwon', 'Lee, Dal Nim', 'Jin, Young Woo', 'Lee, Won Jin', 'Park, Sunhoo']","['Seo S', 'Lee DN', 'Jin YW', 'Lee WJ', 'Park S']","['Laboratory of Low Dose Risk Assessment, National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, 75 Nowon-ro, Nowon-gu, Seoul 01812, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180511,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Radiation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/aac3f3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2018 Sep;38(3):N17-N24. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/aac3f3.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of these agents for hepatoprotection in pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who were treated with methotrexate in their maintenance phase of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty children with B-cell ALL were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 was administered oral vitamin E (400 mg/day); group 2 was administered oral UDCA (15 mg/kg/day); group 3 was administered a combination of the two drugs; and group 4 served as a control group and was administered no drug except their chemotherapy drugs. Complete blood count, liver function test, liver ultrasonography, and liver fibroscan were requested, and the results were compared. RESULTS: Group 1 showed a slight increase in total bilirubin levels compared to baseline levels during the study (P=0.036). Group 2 showed a decline in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels during the study and at 6 months after discontinuing the drug; however, these differences were not statistically significant (P=0.051 and 0.083, respectively). None of the patients showed the evidence of significant fibrosis on liver fibroscan. Eight patients showed some evidence of mild-to-moderate fibrosis (F1, F2), but the results were not different between the groups as well as between pre- and post-study periods in each group. CONCLUSION: Low-dose methotrexate does not cause significant liver fibrosis in pediatric leukemia. UDCA and vitamin E have minimal roles in hepatoprotection among pediatric patients with ALL.","['Bordbar, Mohammadreza', 'Shakibazad, Nader', 'Fattahi, Mohammadreza', 'Haghpanah, Sezaneh', 'Honar, Naser']","['Bordbar M', 'Shakibazad N', 'Fattahi M', 'Haghpanah S', 'Honar N']","['Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Gastroenterology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Turkey,Turk J Gastroenterol,The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,9515841,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholagogues and Choleretics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Vitamin E/*therapeutic use', 'Vitamins/*therapeutic use']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5152/tjg.2018.17521 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Gastroenterol. 2018 Mar;29(2):203-209. doi: 10.5152/tjg.2018.17521.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cholagogues and Choleretics)', '0 (Vitamins)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '724L30Y2QR (Ursodeoxycholic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,PMC6284693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected LRP16 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and found that it was downregulated in tumor samples and HCC cell lines. In a cohort of 80 HCC patients, high level of LRP16 expression in HCC tumors was associated with well differentiation, less lymph node metastasis, and good overall survival (OS). Overexpression of LRP16 in the HepG2 and MHCC-97L cell lines increased cell apoptosis, attenuated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability in vitro, and drastically diminished tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Silencing LRP16 in HCC-LM3 and SMMC-7721 cell lines showed opposite results. Microarray evaluation of tumor cells overexpressing LRP16 revealed the effects on decreased activity in the Wnt signaling pathway. These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blots. Furthermore, inhibition of Wnt signaling decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cell lines. Mechanism conducted showed that LRP16 overexpression could prevent beta-catenin from entering the nucleus. Our study demonstrated that LRP16 suppresses tumor growth in HCC by modulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. KEY MESSAGES: LRP16 was low expression in HCC tissue and cell lines. Low expression of LRP16 in HCC was associated with poor prognosis. LRP16 inhibits activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in HCC.

As such, an emerging avenue for targeted cancer therapies involves neutralizing the anti-phagocytic function using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to enhance tumour cell immunogenicity. A lesser known consequence of CD47 receptor ligation is the direct induction of tumour cell death. While several mAbs and their derivatives with this property have been studied, the best characterized is the commercially available mAb B6H12, which requires immobilization for induction of cell death. Here, we describe a commercially available mAb, CC2C6, which induces T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell death in soluble form. Soluble CC2C6 induces CD47-dependent cell death in a manner consistent with immobilized B6H12, which is characterized by mitochondrial deficiencies but is independent of caspase activation. Titration studies indicated that CC2C6 shares a common CD47-epitope with B6H12. Importantly, CC2C6 retains the anti-phagocytic neutralizing function, thus possessing dual anti-tumour properties. Although CD47-ligation induced cell death occurs in a caspase-independent manner, CC2C6 was found to stimulate increases in Mcl-1 and NOXA levels, two Bcl-2 family proteins that govern the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Further analysis revealed that the ratio of Mcl-1:NOXA were minimally altered for cells treated with CC2C6, in comparison to cells treated with agents that induced caspase-dependent apoptosis which alter this ratio in favour of NOXA. Finally, we found that CC2C6 can synergize with low dose chemotherapeutic agents that induce classical apoptosis, giving rise to the possibility of an effective combination treatment with reduced long-term sequelae associated with high-dose chemotherapies in childhood ALL.","['Leclair, Pascal', 'Liu, Chi-Chao', 'Monajemi, Mahdis', 'Reid, Gregor S', 'Sly, Laura M', 'Lim, Chinten James']","['Leclair P', 'Liu CC', 'Monajemi M', 'Reid GS', 'Sly LM', 'Lim CJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 4H4.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, B.C.

Accumulating evidence suggests that a subset of microRNAs play pivotal roles in modulating such reprogramming of glucose metabolism in cancer cells. miR-3662 has been implicated previously in both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic effects in several types of cancer. The expression level of miR-3662 is downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia, whereas increased miR-3662 expression is observed in lung adenocarcinoma. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of miR-3662 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metabolic reprogramming remain unclear. Our present study revealed that miR-3662 was frequently downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. The low expression level of miR-3662 was associated with tumor size, tumor multiplicity, Edmondson grade, and tumor-node-metastasis stage. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that miR-3662 dampened glycolysis by reducing lactate production, glucose consumption, cellular glucose-6-phosphate level, ATP generation, and extracellular acidification rate, and increasing oxygen consumption rate in HCC cells after treatment with the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2. Moreover, miR-3662 suppressed cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and induced G1/S cell cycle arrest. miR-3662 inhibited the activation of ERK and JNK signaling pathways in HCC. By combined computational and experimental approaches, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was determined as a direct target of miR-3662. After treatment with the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2, miR-3662 regulated the Warburg effect and HCC progression via decreasing HIF-1alpha expression. Our findings uncover a mechanistic role for miR-3662/HIF-1alpha axis in HCC metabolic reprogramming, providing a potential therapeutic strategy in liver cancer.","['Chen, Zhiqiang', 'Zuo, Xueliang', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Han, Guoyong', 'Zhang, Long', 'Wu, Jindao', 'Wang, Xuehao']","['Chen Z', 'Zuo X', 'Zhang Y', 'Han G', 'Zhang L', 'Wu J', 'Wang X']","['Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, 241001, China.', 'Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China. wujindao@njmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. wujindao@njmu.edu.cn.', 'Hepatobiliary Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Key Laboratory of Liver Transplantation, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Nanjing, 210029, China. wangxh@njmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180501,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Aerobiosis', 'Anaerobiosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/11/08 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0616-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0616-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 May 1;9(5):549. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0616-8.,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN-3662 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,PMC5945826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To preserve normal cellular homeostasis, cells must maintain strict control over MCL1 expression. Overexpression of MCL1 has been identified as a key contributor to tumorigenesis, and further enables resistance to a number of anti-cancer chemotherapies. Thus, there is an ongoing interest to develop selective MCL1 inhibitors. In order to better target MCL1, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate MCL1 expression in cells. While MCL1 expression is tightly controlled by multiple mechanisms, the post-transcriptional regulation of MCL1 mRNA is poorly studied. Our previous work identified that polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) binds to MCL1 mRNA and represses MCL1 expression by destabilizing MCL1 mRNA. In this report, we show that PTBP1 modulates MCL1 expression by regulating the microRNA (miRNA) direction of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) to MCL1. We demonstrate that PTBP1 enhances miR-101-guided AGO2 interaction with MCL1, thereby regulating miR-101-induced apoptosis and clonogenic cell survival inhibition in cells. Taken together, not only do these studies expand our understanding on the regulation of MCL1, they also demonstrate that PTBP1 and miRNAs can function cooperatively on a shared target mRNA.","['Cui, Jia', 'Placzek, William J']","['Cui J', 'Placzek WJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35294, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35294, USA. placzek@uab.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180501,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Argonaute Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'PC-3 Cells', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2018/05/12 06:00,2019/11/08 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0551-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0551-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 May 1;9(5):552. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0551-8.,"['0 (AGO2 protein, human)', '0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN101 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PTBP1 protein, human)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)']",,PMC5945587,,,"['P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM117391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trisomy 12 is the second most frequent aberration detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization at the time of diagnosis (10-25%), and it confers an intermediate prognostic risk, with a median time to first treatment of 33 months and a median overall survival of 114 months. Here, we review the unique morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and trisomy 12. These patients carry a significantly higher expression of CD19, CD22, CD20, CD79b, CD24, CD27, CD38, CD49d, sIgM, sIgk, and sIglambda and lower expression of CD43 compared with patients with normal karyotype. Circulating cells show increased expression of the integrins CD11b, CD18, CD29, and ITGB7, and of the adhesion molecule CD323. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and trisomy 12 frequently have unmutated IGHV, ZAP-70 positivity, and closely homologous stereotyped B-cell receptors. They rarely show TP53 mutations but frequently have NOTCH1 mutations, which can be identified in up to 40% of those with a rapidly progressive clinical course.","['Autore, Francesco', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra']","['Autore F', 'Strati P', 'Laurenti L', 'Ferrajoli A']","['Hematology Institute, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Fondazione Policlinico A.

Using ex vivo drug sensitivity screening, we found that FLT3-ITD+ patient cells are particularly sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. While it is well known that HSP90 is important for FLT3-ITD stability, we found that HSP90 family members play a much more complex role in FLT3-ITD signaling than previously appreciated. First, we found that FLT3-ITD activates the unfolded protein response, leading to increased expression of GRP94/HSP90B1. This results in activation of a nefarious feedback loop, in which GRP94 rewires FLT3-ITD signaling by binding and retaining FLT3-ITD in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to aberrant activation of downstream signaling pathways and further inducing the unfolded protein response. Second, HSP90 family proteins protect FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia cells against apoptosis by alleviating proteotoxic stress, and treatment with HSP90 inhibitors results in proteotoxic overload that triggers unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis. Importantly, leukemic stem cells are strongly dependent upon HSP90 for their survival, and the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib causes leukemic stem cell exhaustion in patient-derived mouse xenograft models. Taken together, our study reveals a molecular basis for HSP90 addiction of FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia cells and provides a rationale for including HSP90 inhibitors in the treatment regime for FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zhang, Beibei', 'Duran, Pilar Ayuda', 'Piechaczyk, Laure', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Safont, Mireia Mayoral Safont', 'Karlsen, Ida Tveit', 'Fandalyuk, Zina', 'Tadele, Dagim', 'Mierlo, Pepijn van', 'Rowe, Alexander D', 'Robertson, Joseph M', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Enserink, Jorrit M']","['Zhang B', 'Duran PA', 'Piechaczyk L', 'Floisand Y', 'Safont MMS', 'Karlsen IT', 'Fandalyuk Z', 'Tadele D', 'Mierlo PV', 'Rowe AD', 'Robertson JM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'McCormack E', 'Enserink JM']","['Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway; jorrit.enserink@rr-research.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20180510,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Myeloid Leukemia', '*FLT3', '*GRP94', '*HSP90', '*Leukemic Stem Cell']",2018/05/12 06:00,2018/05/12 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2018.189399 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.189399 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2018 May 10;Online ahead of print. pii: haematol.2018.189399. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.189399.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018, Ferrata Storti Foundation.']",,"['Bjorn Tore Gjertsen Group', 'Emmet McCormack Group']",,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2019 May;104(5):e229.

Little is known about the quality and determinants of end-of-life care for this population, including whether potential increases in hospice use are also accompanied by ""late"" enrollment (</= 3 days before death). Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results-Medicare database, we identified patients >/= 65 years diagnosed with myeloma between 2000 and 2013 who died by December 31, 2013. We assessed prevalence and trends in hospice use, including late enrollment. We also examined six established measures of potentially aggressive medical care at the end of life. Independent predictors of late hospice enrollment and aggressive end-of-life care were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of 12,686 myeloma decedents, 48.2% enrolled in hospice. Among the 6111 who enrolled, 17.2% spent </= 3 days there. There was a significant trend in increasing hospice use, from 28.5% in 2000 to 56.5% by 2013 (Ptrend <0.001), no significant rise in late enrollment (12.2% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2013, Ptrend =0.19), and a slight decrease in aggressive end-of-life care (59.2% in 2000 to 56.7% in 2013, Ptrend =0.01). Patients who were transfusion-dependent, on dialysis, or survived for less than one year were more likely to enroll late in hospice and experience aggressive medical care at the end of life.

In patients lacking matched sibling donor, haploidentical donors are an option. We compared outcomes of unmanipulated (Haplo) to matched sibling donor transplant in acute myeloid leukemia patients in first complete remission. Included were intermediate and high-risk acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission undergoing Haplo and matched sibling donor transplant from 2007-2015, and reported to the ALWP of the EBMT. A propensity score technique was used to confirm results of main analysis: 2 matched sibling donors were matched with 1 Haplo. We identified 2654 pts (Haplo =185; matched sibling donor =2469), 2010 with intermediate acute myeloid leukemia (Haplo=122; matched sibling donor =1888) and 644 with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (Haplo =63; matched sibling donor =581). Median follow up was 30 (range 1-116) months. In multivariate analysis, in intermediate - acute myeloid leukemia patients, Haplo resulted in lower leukemia-free survival (Hazard Ratio 1.74; P<0.01), overall-survival (HR 1.80; P<0.01) and GvHD-free-relapse-free survival (Hazard Ratio 1.32; P<0.05) and higher graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) non-relapse mortality (Hazard Ratio 3.03; P<0.01) as compared to matched sibling donor. In high-risk acute myeloid leukemia, no differences were found in leukemia-free survival, overall-survival, and GvHD-free- relapse-free survival according to donor type. Higher grade II-IV acute GvHD was observed for Haplo in both high-risk (Hazard Ratio 2.20; P<0.01) and intermediate risk (Hazard Ratio 1.84; P<0.01). A trend for a lower Relapse-Incidence was observed in Haplo among high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (Hazard Ratio 0.56; P=0.06). The propensity score analysis confirmed results. Our results underline that matched sibling donor is the first choice for acute myeloid leukemia patients in first complete remission. On the other hand, results of Haplo transplants are similar to matched sibling donor transplants in acute myeloid leukemia patients with high risk cytogenetics.","['Salvatore, Dalila', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Arcese, William', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Salvatore D', 'Labopin M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Battipaglia G', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Ciceri F', 'Blaise D', 'Arcese W', 'Socie G', 'Bourhis JH', 'Van Lint MT', 'Bruno B', 'Huynh A', 'Santarone S', 'Deconinck E', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Hematology Department, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris University UPMC, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France annalisaruggeri80@hotmail.com."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Roma, Italy."", ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Hematology Department, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Shariati Hospital, Hematology-Oncology and BMT Research, Teheran, Iran.', 'Haematology and BMT Unit, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Programme de Transplantation &Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, France.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hopital St. Louis, Dept.of Hematology - BMT, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Ospedale San Martino, Department of Haematology II Genova.', 'A.O.U.

We investigated the risk of long-term respiratory mortality among 5-year cancer survivors diagnosed before age 40 years using the British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS) and Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study (TYACSS). METHODS: The BCCSS comprises 34 489 cancer survivors diagnosed before 15 years from 1940 to 2006 in Great Britain. The TYACSS includes 200 945 cancer survivors diagnosed between 15 years and 39 years from 1971 to 2006 in England and Wales. Standardised mortality ratios and absolute excess risks were used. FINDINGS: Overall, 164 and 1079 respiratory deaths were observed in the BCCSS and TYACSS cohorts respectively, which was 6.8 (95% CI 5.8 to 7.9) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.6 to 1.8) times that expected, but the risks varied substantially by type of respiratory death. Greatest excess numbers of deaths were experienced after central nervous system (CNS) tumours in the BCCSS and after lung cancer, leukaemia, head and neck cancer and CNS tumours in the TYACSS. The excess number of respiratory deaths increased with increasing attained age, with seven (95% CI 2.4 to 11.3) excess deaths observed among those aged 50+ years in the BCCSS and three (95% CI 1.4 to 4.2) excess deaths observed among those aged 60+ years in the TYACSS. It was reassuring to see a decline in the excess number of respiratory deaths among those diagnosed more recently in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to this study, there was almost nothing known about the risks of respiratory death after cancer diagnosed in young adulthood, and this study addresses this gap. These new findings will be useful for both survivors and those involved in their clinical management and follow-up.","['Fidler, Miranda M', 'Reulen, Raoul C', 'Bright, Chloe J', 'Henson, Katherine E', 'Kelly, Julie S', 'Jenney, Meriel', 'Ng, Antony', 'Whelan, Jeremy', 'Winter, David L', 'Frobisher, Clare', 'Hawkins, Michael M']","['Fidler MM', 'Reulen RC', 'Bright CJ', 'Henson KE', 'Kelly JS', 'Jenney M', 'Ng A', 'Whelan J', 'Winter DL', 'Frobisher C', 'Hawkins MM']","['Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Section of Cancer Surveillance, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Clinical Trial Service Unite, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital for Wales, Cardiff, UK."", 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180510,England,Thorax,Thorax,0417353,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Registries', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical epidemiology', '*copd epidemiology', '*paediatric interstitial lung disease', '*pneumonia']",2018/05/12 06:00,2019/03/15 06:00,['2018/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['thoraxjnl-2017-210683 [pii]', '10.1136/thoraxjnl-2017-210683 [doi]']",ppublish,Thorax. 2018 Oct;73(10):959-968. doi: 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2017-210683.

Despite the development of specific therapeutic protocols, infant patients with MLL-rearranged ALL still suffer from a low cure rate. At present, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Recently, the use of small molecule inhibitors targeting the epigenetic regulators of the MLL complex emerged as a promising strategy for the development of a targeted therapy. Herein, we have investigated the effects of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) function abrogation in a preclinical mouse model of MLL-AF4(+) infant ALL using the BET inhibitor I-BET151. We reported that I-BET151 is able to arrest the growth of MLL-AF4(+) leukemic cells in vitro, by blocking cell division and rapidly inducing apoptosis. Treatment with I-BET151 in vivo impairs the leukemic engraftment of patient-derived primary samples and lower the disease burden in mice. I-BET151 affects the transcriptional profile of MLL-rearranged ALL through the deregulation of BRD4, HOXA7/HOXA9, and RUNX1 gene networks. Moreover, I-BET151 treatment sensitizes glucocorticoid-resistant MLL-rearranged cells to prednisolone in vitro and is more efficient when used in combination with HDAC inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo Given the aggressiveness of the disease, the failure of the current therapies and the lack of an ultimate cure, this study paves the way for the use of BET inhibitors to treat MLL-rearranged infant ALL for future clinical applications.

The indenoisoquinolines LMP400, LMP744, and LMP776 are novel noncamptothecin TOP1 inhibitors in clinical trial, which overcome the limitations of camptothecins. To further improve metabolic stability, their methoxy groups have been replaced by fluorine, as in the fluoroindenoisoquinolines NSC 781517 (LMP517), NSC 779135 (LMP135), and NSC 779134 (LMP134). We tested the induction and stability of TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1cc), and the induction and persistence of DNA damage measured by histone H2AX phosphorylation (gammaH2AX) compared with their parent compounds LMP744 and LMP776 in leukemia CCRF-CEM and colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. The fluoroindenoisoquinolines induced TOP1cc and gammaH2AX at nanomolar concentrations, and at higher levels than the parent indenoisoquinolines. The fluoroindenoisoquinoline LMP135 showed greater antitumor activity than topotecan in small-cell lung cancer cell H82 xenografts. It was also more potent than topotecan in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Bioinformatics tools (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb) were used to investigate the following: (i) the correlations of fluoroindenoisoquinolines activity with other drugs, and (ii) genomic determinants of response in the NCI-60. The activity of the fluoroindenoisoquinolines was mostly correlated with camptothecin derivatives and the parent indenoisoquinolines, consistent with TOP1 targeting. Genomic analyses and activity assays in CCRF-CEM SLFN11-deleted cells showed that SLFN11 expression is a dominant determinant of response to LMP135. This study shows the potential value of the fluoroindenoisoquinolines for further development as novel anticancer agents targeting TOP1. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(8); 1694-704.

It is well established that the identification of cytogenetic abnormalities is highly relevant for the prognosis of and therapeutic decisions in ALL. The purpose of the present study was to define the frequency of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities of ALL in Moroccan patients referred exclusively to the BIOLAB Laboratory of the Children's Hospital of Rabat during a 4-year period and compare our findings to the reported data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed conventional karyotyping of 155 ALL cases, with a successful cell culture rate of 94%. RESULTS: We identified chromosomal abnormalities in 66% of the total studied cases, of which 70% revealed important recurrent abnormalities with high prognostic value, such as hyperdiploidy, hypodiploidy, t(9;22), t(8;14), t(1;19), and MLL rearrangements. In total agreement with the reported data, most of the patients (56%) in the present study were aged 1 to 5 years, with a male predominance, and B-ALL was the most common blast phenotype (85%). CONCLUSION: The frequency of most chromosomal rearrangements successfully identified in our study and their lineage correlated with those reported in the published data.","['Chebihi, Zahra Takki', 'Belkhayat, Aziza', 'Chadli, Elbekkay', 'Hilal, Latifa', 'Skhoun, Hanaa', 'Hessissen, Laila', 'El Khorassani, Mohamed', 'El Kababri, Maria', 'Kili, Amina', 'Khattab, Mohammed', 'Bakri, Youssef', 'Dakka, Nadia']","['Chebihi ZT', 'Belkhayat A', 'Chadli E', 'Hilal L', 'Skhoun H', 'Hessissen L', 'El Khorassani M', 'El Kababri M', 'Kili A', 'Khattab M', 'Bakri Y', 'Dakka N']","['Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco; BIOLAB Laboratory, Rabat, Morocco.

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes substantial morbidity in patients with CLL, a group known to respond poorly to polysaccharide vaccines. Comparative studies with conjugated vaccines are lacking. METHODS: 128 treatment naive CLL patients from eight hematology clinics in Sweden were randomized to vaccination with PCV13 (n=63) or PPSV23 (n=65) after stratification by IgG level and CLL clinical stage (Rai). Blood samples for evaluation of immune response were obtained at baseline, and at one and six months after vaccination. Analyses for each of the 12 pneumococcal serotypes common for PCV13 and PPSV23 were performed by opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: PCV13 elicited a superior immune response than PPSV23 in 10/12 serotypes one month after vaccination and in 5/12 serotypes six months after vaccination, measured as OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs). Geometric mean concentrations of serotype-specific IgG antibodies elicited by PCV13 as measured by ELISA, were higher than those elicited by PPSV23 in half of the common serotypes, both after one and six months. PPSV23 did not trigger a better immune response than PCV13 for any of the serotypes, regardless of analysis method or time point of analysis. Negative predictive factors for vaccination response were hypogammaglobulinemia and long disease duration. Both vaccines were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with previously untreated CLL, the efficacy of PCV13 in terms of immune response is superior to PPSV23 for most serotypes common for the two vaccines. We therefore propose that PCV13 should be included in vaccination programs against Streptococcus pneumoniae for CLL patients and administered as early as possible during the course of the disease.","['Svensson, Tobias', 'Kattstrom, Magdalena', 'Hammarlund, Ylva', 'Roth, Daniel', 'Andersson, P-O', 'Svensson, Magnus', 'Nilsson, Ingmar', 'Rombo, Lars', 'Cherif, Honar', 'Kimby, Eva']","['Svensson T', 'Kattstrom M', 'Hammarlund Y', 'Roth D', 'Andersson PO', 'Svensson M', 'Nilsson I', 'Rombo L', 'Cherif H', 'Kimby E']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

The current study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy versus EGFR-TKIs alone as first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations and BIM deletion polymorphism. METHODS: A retrospective, non-randomized analysis was conducted. BIM deletion polymorphism was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and direct sequencing of DNA from peripheral blood cells. Clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), progress-free-survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and treatment-related adverse events were compared between EGFR-TKIs alone versus EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy group. RESULTS: 65 patients were enrolled. 36 of them received EGFR-TKIs and 29 received EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy. EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy had significantly higher ORR than TKIs alone (65.5% vs. 38.9%, P=0.046). Median PFS was significantly longer in EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy group than in TKIs group (7.2 vs 4.7m; P=0.008). Median OS was numerically longer in EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy group than in TKIs alone (18.5 vs 14.2m; P=0.107). EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy was associated with more grade 3 or 4 hematological toxic effects than EGFR-TKIs alone. CONCLUSION: EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy conferred a significantly higher ORR, prolonged PFS and numerically longer OS in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation and BIM deletion polymorphism. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.","['Liu, Sangtian', 'He, Yayi', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Ren, Shengxiang', 'Zhou, Fei', 'Zhao, Chao', 'Li, Xuefei', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Su, Chunxia', 'Chen, Xiaoxia', 'Cai, Weijing', 'Gao, Guanghui', 'Li, Wei', 'Wu, Fengying', 'Li, Jiayu', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Hu, Qiong', 'Zhao, Mingchuan', 'Zhou, Caicun', 'Hirsch, Fred R']","['Liu S', 'He Y', 'Jiang T', 'Ren S', 'Zhou F', 'Zhao C', 'Li X', 'Zhang J', 'Su C', 'Chen X', 'Cai W', 'Gao G', 'Li W', 'Wu F', 'Li J', 'Zhao J', 'Hu Q', 'Zhao M', 'Zhou C', 'Hirsch FR']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lung Cancer and Immunology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Lung Cancer and Immunology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University Medical School Cancer Institute, Tongji University School of Medicine, No. 507 Zhengmin Road, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.

Many saponins are known to display anti-cancer effects. In this study, the cytotoxicity and the modes of action of a naturally occuring oleanane-type tritepene saponin, ardisiacrispin B isolated from the fruit of Ardisia kivuensis Taton (Myrsinaceae) was evaluated on a panel of 9 cancer cell lines including various sensitive and drug-resistant phenotypes. METHODS: Resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate cytotoxicity and ferroptotic cell death of samples; caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspases in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptotic cells by annexin V/PI staining, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: Ardisiacrispin B displayed significant cytotoxic effects in the 9 tested cancer cell lines with IC50 values below 10 microM. The IC50 values ranges were 1.20 microM (towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 6.76 microM [against heptocarcinoma HepG2 cells] for ardisiacrispin B and 0.02 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 microM (against resistant CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) for doxorubicin. Collateral sensitivity of resistant HCT116p53(-/-) colon adenocarcinoma cells to ardisiacripsin B was observed. Ardisiacrispin B induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via activation of inititator caspases 8 and 9 and effector caspase 3/7, alteration of MMP and increase in ROS production. Ferroptosis also contributed to the cytotoxicity of ardisiacrispin B. CONCLUSIONS: The studied oleanane-type triterpene saponin is a good cytotoxic molecule that deserve more detailed exploration in the future, to develop novel cytotoxic drugs to combat both sensitive and drug-resistant cancers.","['Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Ndontsa, Blanche L', 'Kuete, Victor', 'Nguekeu, Yves M M', 'Celik, Ilhami', 'Mbouangouere, Roukayatou', 'Tane, Pierre', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mbaveng AT', 'Ndontsa BL', 'Kuete V', 'Nguekeu YMM', 'Celik I', 'Mbouangouere R', 'Tane P', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, Mainz 55128, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, Mainz 55128, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Anadolu University, Tepebasi, Eskisehir 26470, Turkey.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, Mainz 55128, Germany.

Three main secondary metabolites of Crocus sativus including crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal are responsible for the color, the bitter taste and for the odor and aroma, respectively. As a component of traditional medicine, saffron has been utilized as a medicinal herb for treating various ailments including cramps, asthma, liver disease, menstruation disorders, pain, and in the pathogenesis of cancer. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To summarize the recent published data on the chemo-preventive properties of Crocus sativus in cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a non-systematic review of the literature. METHODS: A search of English-language literature was performed using Scopus, EMBASE and PubMed. We applied no restriction in time. Articles were searched using the keywords ""Lung"", ""breast"", ""skin"", ""prostate"", ""leukemia"", ""cancer"", ""neoplasm"", ""tumor"", ""malignancy"", ""saffron"", ""crocus sativus"", ""crocin"", ""crocetin"", ""picrocrocin"", and ""safranal"". RESULTS: Saffron has been reported to exert anti-tumor and anti-cancer effects in various types of cancer including lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, skin cancer and prostate cancer. This appears to be via various mechanisms including: the induction of apoptosis, arresting cell cycle progression, suppressing expression of matrix metalloproteinase, modulatory effects on some phase II detoxifying enzymes and decreasing expression of inflammatory molecules are potential mechanisms of saffron-induced anticancer effects. CONCLUSION: Saffron possesses potent anti-tumor properties and represents an efficacious and safe treatment.","['Khorasanchi, Zahra', 'Shafiee, Mojtaba', 'Kermanshahi, Farnoush', 'Khazaei, Majid', 'Ryzhikov, Mikhail', 'Parizadeh, Mohammad Reza', 'Kermanshahi, Behnoush', 'Ferns, Gordon A', 'Avan, Amir', 'Hassanian, Seyed Mahdi']","['Khorasanchi Z', 'Shafiee M', 'Kermanshahi F', 'Khazaei M', 'Ryzhikov M', 'Parizadeh MR', 'Kermanshahi B', 'Ferns GA', 'Avan A', 'Hassanian SM']","['Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, St. Louis University, School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran.', 'Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Division of Medical Education, Falmer, Brighton, Sussex BN1 9PH, UK.', 'Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

Increased resistance to apoptosis is a key oncogenic mechanism in several hematological malignancies and, in many cases, especially in lymphoid neoplasias, has been attributed to the upregulation of BCL-2. The BCL-2 protein is the founding member of the BCL-2 family of apoptosis regulators and was the first apoptosis modulator to be associated with cancer. The recognition of the important role played by BCL-2 for cancer development and resistance to treatment made it a relevant target for therapy for many diseases, including solid tumors and hematological neoplasias. Among the different strategies that have been developed to inhibit BCL-2, BH3-mimetics have emerged as a novel class of compounds with favorable results in different clinical settings, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In April 2016, the first inhibitor of BCL-2, venetoclax, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with CLL who have 17p deletion and had received at least one prior therapy. This review focuses on the relevance of BCL-2 for apoptosis modulation at the mitochondrial level, its potential as therapeutic target for hematological malignancies, and the results obtained with selective inhibitors belonging to the BH3-mimetics, especially venetoclax used in monotherapy or in combination with other agents.","['Perini, Guilherme Fleury', 'Ribeiro, Glaciano Nogueira', 'Pinto Neto, Jorge Vaz', 'Campos, Laura Tojeiro', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson']","['Perini GF', 'Ribeiro GN', 'Pinto Neto JV', 'Campos LT', 'Hamerschlak N']","['Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Av.

Methods: Eleven cases of myeloid sarcoma and leukemia, 9 of non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) , 13 of cervical lymphoma-like lesions were selected from Peking University People's Hospital from January 2006 to August 2017. According to WHO classification of tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (2008) and updated classification(2016), the cases were studied by microscopy, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Results: In 20 cases of tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, the mean and median age was 48.5 and 56 years old (range: 16-77 years old) . In cases of lymphoma-like lesion of uterine cervix, the mean and median age was 45.9 and 48 years old (range: 23-62 years old) . The patients with neoplasm present as fever, fatigue, hypogastralgia, colporrhagia and mass etc. Eight cases had history of acute myeloid leukemia, and 3 had myeloid leukemia while pregnancy. One case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) had history of ovary small cell carcinoma and high grade serous carcinoma resected with chemotherapy. One case of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) had history of renal transplantation. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated in 9 cases (9/18) . The cases of lymphoma-like lesion present as contact bleeding in most cases and all located in cervix. Four cases of neoplasm located in vulva, 1 in vagina, 4 in cervix, 4 in uterine corpus, 8 in ovary and 2 in placenta. Clinical staging of NHL: 4 case was stage, 1 case of stage, and 4 cases of stage . Pathological morphology: 9 cases were myeloid sarcoma, 2 cases were placenta invaded by myeloid leukemia. Six cases were DLBCL, and 1 case was CLL/SLL, 1 case was mucosa associated lymphoid tissuse lymphoma (MALToma) , and 1 case was anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Resected mass, chemotherapy was performed in tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue. Five cases of myeloid sarcoma and 2 of NHL died. In 13 cases of lymphoma-like lesion of uterine cervix, the general condition was good as following up. Conclusions: The clinical history, pathological morphology and immunohistochemistry are very important for diagnosing tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue in the female productive tract. Resection with chemotherapy is recommended in treatment. The prognosis of lymphoma-like lesion of uterine cervix is good, and should be differentiated from lymphoma.","['Chen, D B', 'Zhang, H', 'Zhang, Y H', 'Wang, Y', 'Song, Q J', 'Yang, S M', 'Cui, H', 'Zhao, Y', 'Fang, X Z', 'Shen, D H']","['Chen DB', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang YH', 'Wang Y', 'Song QJ', 'Yang SM', 'Cui H', 'Zhao Y', 'Fang XZ', 'Shen DH']","[""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,16210370R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Uterine Neoplasms/pathology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Genital neoplasms, female', 'Leukemia, myeloid', 'Lymphoma, non-Hodgkin', 'Lymphoproliferative disorders']",2018/05/12 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-567x.2018.04.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi. 2018 Apr 25;53(4):263-269. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-567x.2018.04.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a great challenge to develop effective preventive methods for ALV-J control due to its antigenic variations in the variable regions of envelope. In present study, we generated a mouse polyclonal antibody targeting the first extracellular loop (ECL1) of chicken Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (chNHE1), the receptor of ALV-J, to block ALV-J infection in vitro and in vivo. In ALV-J infected DF-1 cells, chNHE1 expression and the intracellular pH (pHi) were up-regulated with ""wave"" pattern, indicating that the disequilibrium of ALV-J infected cells associated with chNHE1. Next, we validated that ALV-J infection was significantly blocked with time dependent after treating with anti-ECL1 antibody and accordingly the pHi value were recovered, indicating the blockage of ALV-J infection did not affect Na(+)/H(+) exchange. Furthermore, in anti-ECL1 antibody treatment chickens that infected by ALV-J, weight gain and immune organs were recovered, and viral loads were significantly decreased, and the tissue injury and inflammation were reduced significantly from 21 to 35days of age. The study demonstrated that anti-ECL1 antibody effectively blocks ALV-J infection without affecting Na(+)/H(+) exchange, and sheds light on a novel strategy for retroviruses control.","['Meng, Wei', 'Zhou, Defang', 'Li, Chengui', 'Wang, Guihua', 'Huang, Libo', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Meng W', 'Zhou D', 'Li C', 'Wang G', 'Huang L', 'Cheng Z']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China.

METHODS: Patients with AL or MDS undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to open-label micafungin 100mg intravenously daily or posaconazole suspension 400mg orally twice daily until neutrophil recovery, up to 28 days. Patients were followed for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was prophylaxis failure (premature discontinuation due to infection, intolerance, adverse event, or death). Time to failure and survival were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: From March 2011 to May 2016, 113 patients who received at least 2 doses of prophylaxis were analyzed (58 patients randomized to micafungin and 55 to posaconazole). Prophylaxis failure occurred in 34.5% and 52.7% of patients on micafungin and posaconazole, respectively (P=0.0118). The median number of days on prophylaxis was 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 12-20] for micafungin and 13 [IQR 6-16] for posaconazole (P=0.01). Micafungin failures were largely due to antifungal treatment; posaconazole failures were mostly due to gastrointestinal intolerance or adverse effects. IFI incidence and survival were similar between study arms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support micafungin as alternative antifungal prophylaxis in patients with AL and MDS.","['Epstein, David J', 'Seo, Susan K', 'Huang, Yao-Ting', 'Park, Jay H', 'Klimek, Virginia M', 'Berman, Ellin', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Frattini, Mark G', 'Papanicolaou, Genovefa A']","['Epstein DJ', 'Seo SK', 'Huang YT', 'Park JH', 'Klimek VM', 'Berman E', 'Tallman MS', 'Frattini MG', 'Papanicolaou GA']","['Infectious Disease Service, Division of Subspecialty Medicine, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Infectious Disease Service, Division of Subspecialty Medicine, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Infectious Disease Service, Division of Subspecialty Medicine, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; Leukemia Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; Leukemia Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; Leukemia Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; Leukemia Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA; Leukemia Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Infectious Disease Service, Division of Subspecialty Medicine, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.

Because hypoxia is known to cause resistance to chemotherapy, we developed a synthetic niche that mimics the low oxygen levels found in leukemic bone marrow to evaluate the effects of hypoxia on the tested inhibitors. Drug sensitivity screening was performed using the Agilent BioCel automated liquid handling system integrated with the HyperCyt HT flow cytometry platform, and the uptake of propidium iodide was used as an indication of cell viability.

Physiological expression of specific NKL homeobox genes obeys a hematopoietic NKL-code implicated in the process of lymphopoiesis while in differentiated T-cells these genes are silenced. We propose that this developmental expression pattern underlies the observation that NKL homeobox genes are the most ubiquitous group of transcription factors deregulated in T-ALL, including TLX1, TLX3, NKX2-5 and NKX3-1. Here, we describe a novel member of the NKL homeobox gene subclass, NKX3-2 (BAPX1), which is aberrantly activated in 18% of pediatric T-ALL patients analyzed while being normally expressed in developing spleen. Identification of NKX3-2 expression in T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM qualified these cells to model its deregulation and function in a leukemic context. Genomic and chromosomal analyses demonstrated normal configuration of the NKX3-2 locus at chromosome 4p15, thus excluding cytogenetic dysregulation. Comparative expression profiling analysis of NKX3-2 patient data revealed deregulated activity of BMP- and MAPK-signalling. These candidate pathways were experimentally confirmed to mediate aberrant NKX3-2 expression. We also show that homeobox gene SIX6, plus MIR17HG and GATA3 are downstream targets of NKX3-2 and plausibly contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignancy by suppressing T-cell differentiation. Finally, NKL homeobox gene NKX2-5 was activated by NKX3-2 in CCRF-CEM and by FOXG1 in PEER, representing mutually inhibitory activators of this translocated oncogene. Together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic NKL homeobox gene subclass member which is aberrantly expressed in a large subset of T-ALL patients and participates in a deregulated gene network likely to arise in developing spleen.","['Nagel, Stefan', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Nagel S', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Zaborski M', 'MacLeod RAF', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180510,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Loci', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197194 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-44174 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 May 10;13(5):e0197194. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197194. eCollection 2018.,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NKX3-2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,PMC5944955,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4431-8988'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we mainly consider that haematopoietic lineages are tightly controlled by negative feedback inhibition of end-product. Actually, leukemia has been found 100 years ago. Up to now, the exact mechanism is still unknown, and many factors are thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. Nevertheless, it is very necessary to continue the profound study of the pathogenesis of leukemia. Here, we propose a new mathematical model which include some negative feedback inhibition from the terminally differentiated cells of haematopoietic lineages to the haematopoietic stem cells and haematopoietic progenitor cells in order to describe the regulatory mechanisms mentioned above by a set of ordinary differential equations. Afterwards, we carried out detailed dynamical bifurcation analysis of the model, and obtained some meaningful results. RESULTS: In this work, we mainly perform the analysis of the mathematic model by bifurcation theory and numerical simulations. We have not only incorporated some new negative feedback mechanisms to the existing model, but also constructed our own model by using the modeling method of stem cell theory with probability method. Through a series of qualitative analysis and numerical simulations, we obtain that the weak negative feedback for differentiation probability is conducive to the cure of leukemia. However, with the strengthening of negative feedback, leukemia will be more difficult to be cured, and even induce death. In contrast, strong negative feedback for differentiation rate of progenitor cells can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that healthy progenitor cells are bestowed a competitive advantage over leukaemia stem cells. Weak g1, g2, and h1 enable the system stays in the healthy state. However, strong h2 can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia.","['Jiao, Jianfeng', 'Luo, Min', 'Wang, Ruiqi']","['Jiao J', 'Luo M', 'Wang R']","['Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shangda Road No.99, Shanghai, 200444, China.', 'Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shangda Road No.99, Shanghai, 200444, China.', 'Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shangda Road No.99, Shanghai, 200444, China. rqwang@shu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180424,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,IM,"['*Feedback, Physiological', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hill function', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*feedback regulation', '*haematopoietic stem cells', '*mathematical model']",2018/05/11 06:00,2019/05/28 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12918-018-0561-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12918-018-0561-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2018 Apr 24;12(Suppl 4):43. doi: 10.1186/s12918-018-0561-2.,,,PMC5998901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For decades, excess leukemia risk, especially that in the Pliofilm((R)) cohort, has been the focus of benzene risk assessment. While more stringent benzene standards, often </=1 ppm, have been promulgated to protect workers from developing leukemia, recent epidemiologic studies have reported elevated risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This report aims to examine whether the use of new data on MDS is scientifically warranted in future benzene risk assessments. First, we reviewed current benzene guidelines, regulations, and underlying risk assessments in developed countries. Second, we examined current epidemiologic literature on benzene and MDS, which identified seven studies with simultaneous measures of MDS risk and benzene exposure and 17 studies on MDS in populations potentially exposed to benzene. Next, we examined the potential of the MDS data to serve as the basis of future benzene risk assessments, by comparing its quality and risk estimates with those used in current benzene standards. We conclude from the current literature that there is strong evidence that MDS can be caused by benzene, and the MDS data from the pooled petroleum study should be further examined in future benzene risk assessments. We recommend that future MDS-based benzene risk assessment use total MDS as the endpoint, take into consideration the full exposure period, and examine a range of benzene exposure metrics, including the role of peak, intermittent benzene exposures.","['Li, Wenchao', 'Schnatter, A Robert']","['Li W', 'Schnatter AR']","['a Occupational and Public Health Division , ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences Inc. , Annandale , NJ , USA.', 'b Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health , Ann Arbor , MI , USA.', 'a Occupational and Public Health Division , ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences Inc. , Annandale , NJ , USA.', 'c EpiSolutions, LLC , Easton , PA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180510,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Benzene', '*Pliofilm', '*cancer', '*epidemiologic studies', '*guideline', '*leukemia', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*occupational exposure', '*pooled petroleum study', '*regulation', '*review', '*risk assessment']",2018/05/11 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408444.2018.1437389 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2018 Jul;48(6):417-432. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2018.1437389.

This overexpression activity of Mcl1 eventually develops strong resistance to a wide variety of anticancer agents. Therefore, designing novel inhibitors with potentials to elicit higher binding affinity and specificity to inhibit Mcl1 activity is of greater importance. Thus, Mcl1 acts as an attractive cancer target. Despite recent experimental advancement in the identification and characterization of benzothiophene and benzofuran scaffold-merged compounds, the molecular mechanisms of their binding to Mcl1 are yet to be explored. The current study demonstrates an integrated approach - pharmacophore-based 3D-QSAR, docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and free-energy estimation - to access the precise and comprehensive effects of current inhibitors targeting Mcl1 together with its known activity values. The pharmacophore - ANRRR.240 - based 3D-QSAR model from the current study provided high confidence (R(2)=0.9154, Q(2)=0.8736 and RMSE = 0.3533) values. Furthermore, the docking correctly predicted the binding mode of highly active compound 42. Additionally, the MD simulation for docked complex under explicit-solvent conditions together with free-energy estimation exhibited stable interaction and binding strength over the time period. Also, the decomposition analysis revealed potential energy contributing residues - M231, M250, V253, R265, L267 and F270 - to the complex stability. Overall, the current investigation might serve as a valuable insight, either to (i) improve the binding affinity of the current compounds or (ii) discover new generation anticancer agents that can effectively downregulate Mcl1 activity.

Here, we studied the treatment-free survival (TFS) impact of normal serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) at diagnosis. One hundred twelve patients with CLL were analyzed. The main prognostic factors (Binet stage; lymphocytosis; IGHV mutation status; TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, and BIRC3 mutations; and cytogenetic abnormalities) were studied. The frequencies of IGHV mutation status, cytogenetic abnormalities, and TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, and BIRC3 mutations were not significantly different between normal and abnormal SPE. Normal SPE was associated with Binet stage A, nonprogressive disease for 6 months, lymphocytosis below 30 G/L, and the absence of the IGHV3-21 gene rearrangement which is associated with poor prognosis. The TFS of patients with normal SPE was significantly longer than that of patients with abnormal SPE (log-rank test: P = 0.0015, with 51% untreated patients at 5.6 years and a perfect plateau afterward vs. a median TFS at 2.64 years for abnormal SPE with no plateau). Multivariate analysis using two different Cox models and bootstrapping showed that normal SPE was an independent good prognostic marker for either Binet stage, lymphocytosis, or IGHV mutation status. TFS was further increased when both normal SPE and mutated IGHV were present (log-rank test: P = 0.008, median not reached, plateau at 5.6 years and 66% untreated patients). A comparison with other prognostic markers suggested that normal SPE could reflect slowly advancing CLL disease. Altogether, our results show that a combination of normal SPE and mutated IGHV genes defines a subgroup of patients with CLL who evolve very slowly and who might never need treatment.","['Chauzeix, Jasmine', 'Laforet, Marie-Pierre', 'Deveza, Melanie', 'Crowther, Liam', 'Marcellaud, Elodie', 'Derouault, Paco', 'Lia, Anne-Sophie', 'Boyer, Francois', 'Bargues, Nicolas', 'Olombel, Guillaume', 'Jaccard, Arnaud', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Rizzo, David']","['Chauzeix J', 'Laforet MP', 'Deveza M', 'Crowther L', 'Marcellaud E', 'Derouault P', 'Lia AS', 'Boyer F', 'Bargues N', 'Olombel G', 'Jaccard A', 'Feuillard J', 'Gachard N', 'Rizzo D']","['Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, EA6309, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, EA6309, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Limoges, Limoges, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, UMR CNRS 7276 CRIBL, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180509,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Blood Proteins', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Electrophoresis', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['* IGHV', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*prognosis', '*serum protein electrophoresis']",2018/05/11 06:00,2019/10/30 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1510 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2018 Jun;7(6):2621-2628. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1510.

However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how dasatinib suppresses the growth of GC cells and interacts with chemotherapeutic drugs. The results showed that, in the presence of dasatinib, proliferation of GC cells decreased and apoptosis increased, and that Fas-associated death domain protein and caspase-8 are essential to dasatinib-induced cell apoptosis in GC. In addition, we found that dasatinib increased the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5) in GC cells. Dasatinib enhanced apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in GC cells. Moreover, increased DR5 expression facilitated dasatinib-induced apoptosis; the dasatinib-induced increase in DR5 expression was mediated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Furthermore, dasatinib also synergized with TRAIL to induce apoptosis via DR5 in GC cells. Our results show that dasatinib promoted TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via upregulation of CHOP-dependent DR5 expression in GC, suggesting that DR5 induction can be used as an indicator of dasatinib sensitivity.","['Wang, Xiaona', 'Xue, Qiang', 'Wu, Liangliang', 'Wang, Baogui', 'Liang, Han']","['Wang X', 'Xue Q', 'Wu L', 'Wang B', 'Liang H']","[""Department of Gastric Cancer Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer China."", ""Department of Gastric Cancer Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer China."", ""Department of Gastric Cancer Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer China."", ""Department of Gastric Cancer Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer China."", ""Department of Gastric Cancer Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180323,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,,,['NOTNLM'],"['TRAIL', 'apoptosis', 'dasatinib', 'death receptor 5', 'gastric cancer']",2018/05/11 06:00,2018/05/11 06:01,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/2211-5463.12404 [doi]', 'FEB412404 [pii]']",epublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2018 Mar 23;8(5):732-742. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.12404. eCollection 2018 May.,,,PMC5929929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The early stages of these diseases present manageable symptoms and, in the case of CML, highly effective treatment options. Progression to the more aggressive stages of the diseases limits effective treatment and significantly exacerbates patient prognosis. The mechanisms causing delay and disease progression are largely unknown. The later stages of these diseases are characterized by excessive build up of primitive cell types, indicating a disruption in the normal cell differentiation process that is commonly regulated through feedback from differentiated types. In this study, we propose a mechanism where mutated primitive cells produce a feedback interference signal that desensitizes them to a normal homeostatic feedback. Using a mathematical model, we show that this mechanism can account for the long delay period between occurrence of genetic changes and symptomatic onset characterized by fast growth of cancerous cell population. Finally, we explore novel concepts for potential treatment of chronic cancers.","['Haney, Seth', 'Reya, Tannishtha', 'Bazhenov, Maxim']","['Haney S', 'Reya T', 'Bazhenov M']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161021,England,Converg Sci Phys Oncol,Convergent science physical oncology,101674478,,,,,2016/01/01 00:00,2016/01/01 00:01,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1088/2057-1739/2/4/045002 [doi]'],ppublish,Converg Sci Phys Oncol. 2016;2(4). doi: 10.1088/2057-1739/2/4/045002.

We used primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples and human AML cell lines to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy and its role in AML differentiation. We found a significantly lower expression of key autophagy- (ATG-) related genes in primary AML as compared to healthy granulocytes, an increased autophagic activity during all-trans retinoic acid- (ATRA-) induced neutrophil differentiation, and an impaired AML differentiation upon inhibition of ATG3, ATG4D, and ATG5. Supporting the notion of noncanonical autophagy, we found that ATRA-induced autophagy was Beclin1-independent compared to starvation- or arsenic trioxide- (ATO-) induced autophagy. Furthermore, we identified PU.1 as positive transcriptional regulator of ATG3, ATG4D, and ATG5. Low PU.1 expression in AML may account for low ATG gene expression in this disease. Low expression of the autophagy initiator ULK1 in AML can partially be attributed to high expression of the ULK1-targeting microRNA-106a. Our data clearly suggest that granulocytic AML differentiation relies on noncanonical autophagy pathways and that restoring autophagic activity might be beneficial in differentiation therapies.","['Jin, Jing', 'Britschgi, Adrian', 'Schlafli, Anna M', 'Humbert, Magali', 'Shan-Krauer, Deborah', 'Batliner, Jasmin', 'Federzoni, Elena A', 'Ernst, Marion', 'Torbett, Bruce E', 'Yousefi, Shida', 'Simon, Hans-Uwe', 'Tschan, Mario P']","['Jin J', 'Britschgi A', 'Schlafli AM', 'Humbert M', 'Shan-Krauer D', 'Batliner J', 'Federzoni EA', 'Ernst M', 'Torbett BE', 'Yousefi S', 'Simon HU', 'Tschan MP']","['Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Medi, School for Biomedical Analysts, CH-3014 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Members of the Horizon 2020 COST action TRANSAUTOPHAGY (CA15138), Brussel, Belgium.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Members of the Horizon 2020 COST action TRANSAUTOPHAGY (CA15138), Brussel, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180318,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,IM,"['Autophagy/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Phenotype']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/1482795 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2018 Mar 18;2018:1482795. doi: 10.1155/2018/1482795. eCollection 2018.,,,PMC5878891,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5897-3647'],,['P30 AI036214/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis induced by essential oil was confirmed by cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 that suppressed the colony-forming ability of tumor cells and 50 % inhibition occurred at a dose of 25 mug/mL. Moreover, essential oil inhibited the activation of inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB and inhibited expression of NF-kappaB regulated gene products linked to cell survival (survivin, c-FLIP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-Myc, c-IAP2), proliferation (Cyclin D1) and metastasis (MMP-9).

Here, we show that MYC transcriptionally upregulates the ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 (UFD1) gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Allelic loss of ufd1 in zebrafish induces tumor cell apoptosis and impairs MYC-driven T-ALL progression but does not affect general health. As the E2 component of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, UFD1 facilitates the elimination of misfolded/unfolded proteins from the ER. We found that UFD1 inactivation in human T-ALL cells impairs ERAD, exacerbates ER stress, and induces apoptosis. Moreover, we show that UFD1 inactivation promotes the proapoptotic unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK). This effect is demonstrated by an upregulation of PERK and its downstream effector C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as a downregulation of BCL2 and BCLxL. Indeed, CHOP inactivation or BCL2 overexpression is sufficient to rescue tumor cell apoptosis induced by UFD1 knockdown. Together, our studies identify UFD1 as a critical regulator of the ER stress response and a novel contributor to MYC-mediated leukemia aggressiveness, with implications for targeted therapy in T-ALL and likely other MYC-driven cancers.","['Huiting, L N', 'Samaha, Y', 'Zhang, G L', 'Roderick, J E', 'Li, B', 'Anderson, N M', 'Wang, Y W', 'Wang, L', 'Laroche, Fjf', 'Choi, J W', 'Liu, C T', 'Kelliher, M A', 'Feng, H']","['Huiting LN', 'Samaha Y', 'Zhang GL', 'Roderick JE', 'Li B', 'Anderson NM', 'Wang YW', 'Wang L', 'Laroche F', 'Choi JW', 'Liu CT', 'Kelliher MA', 'Feng H']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Cancer Research Center, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Cancer Research Center, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Metropolitan College, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Vaccine Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Cancer Research Center, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Cancer Research Center, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Cancer Research Center, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Wuhan University School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, P.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EZH2 overexpression and its role in drug resistance of MM remain undefined. Here we show that EZH2 is upregulated in drug-resistant MM cells and its aberrant overexpression is associated with poor prognosis of MM patients. Overexpression of EZH2 in parental MM cells renders them resistant to anti-myeloma drugs and suppression of EZH2 displays the opposite effects. Using miRNA target scan algorithms, we identify miR-138 as a regulator of EZH2, which is conversely repressed by EZH2-induced H3K27 trimethylation in MM-resistant cell lines and primary tumor cells. Analysis of ChIP-seq dataset and H3K27me3 ChIP reveals that RBPMS is a direct and functionally relevant target of EZH2. RBPMS silencing confers resistance to MM cells and restoration of RBPMS by miR-138 overexpression re-sensitizes the resistant cells to drug. Importantly, in vivo delivery of miR-138 mimics or pharmacological inhibitor of EZH2 in combination with a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, induces significant regression of tumors in xenograft model.

We evaluated the role of IRAK1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and assessed the inhibitory activity of multikinase inhibitor pacritinib on IRAK1 in AML. We demonstrated that IRAK1 is overexpressed in AML and provides a survival signal to AML cells. Genetic knockdown of IRAK1 in primary AML samples and xenograft model showed a significant reduction in leukemia burden. Kinase profiling indicated pacritinib has potent inhibitory activity against IRAK1. Computational modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated high-affinity binding of pacritinib to the IRAK1 kinase domain. Pacritinib exposure reduced IRAK1 phosphorylation in AML cells. A higher percentage of primary AML samples showed robust sensitivity to pacritinib, which inhibits FLT3, JAK2, and IRAK1, relative to FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib or JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, demonstrating the importance of IRAK1 inhibition. Pacritinib inhibited the growth of AML cells harboring a variety of genetic abnormalities not limited to FLT3 and JAK2. Pacritinib treatment reduced AML progenitors in vitro and the leukemia burden in AML xenograft model. Overall, IRAK1 contributes to the survival of leukemic cells, and the suppression of IRAK1 may be beneficial among heterogeneous AML subtypes.","['Hosseini, Mona M', 'Kurtz, Stephen E', 'Abdelhamed, Sherif', 'Mahmood, Shawn', 'Davare, Monika A', 'Kaempf, Andy', 'Elferich, Johannes', 'McDermott, Jason E', 'Liu, Tao', 'Payne, Samuel H', 'Shinde, Ujwal', 'Rodland, Karin D', 'Mori, Motomi', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Singer, Jack W', 'Agarwal, Anupriya']","['Hosseini MM', 'Kurtz SE', 'Abdelhamed S', 'Mahmood S', 'Davare MA', 'Kaempf A', 'Elferich J', 'McDermott JE', 'Liu T', 'Payne SH', 'Shinde U', 'Rodland KD', 'Mori M', 'Druker BJ', 'Singer JW', 'Agarwal A']","['Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Blood &Cancer Biology Program, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Blood &Cancer Biology Program, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA.', 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA.', 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA.', 'Biostatistics Shared Resource, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'CTI BioPharma Corp, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA. agarwala@ohsu.edu.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA. agarwala@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180329,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/drug effects/genetics', 'Nitriles', 'Phenylurea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0112-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0112-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Nov;32(11):2374-2387. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0112-2.

ZBTB46 is a zinc finger and BTB domain-containing transcription factor, which is expressed by dendritic cells and committed dendritic cell precursors, but not by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, or other immune cell populations. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of ZBTB46 identifies human dendritic cell neoplasms. We examined ZBTB46 expression in a range of benign and malignant histiocytic disorders and found that ZBTB46 is able to clearly define the dendritic cell identity of many previously unclassified histiocytic disease subtypes. In particular, all examined cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis and histiocytic sarcoma expressed ZBTB46, while all cases of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, juvenile xanthogranuloma, Rosai-Dorfman disease, and Erdheim-Chester disease failed to demonstrate expression of ZBTB46. Moreover, ZBTB46 expression clarified the identity of diagnostically challenging neoplasms, such as cases of indeterminate cell histiocytosis, classifying a fraction of these entities as dendritic cell malignancies. These findings clarify the lineage origins of human histiocytic disorders and distinguish dendritic cell disorders from all other myeloid neoplasms.","['Satpathy, Ansuman T', 'Brown, Ryanne A', 'Gomulia, Ellen', 'Briseno, Carlos G', 'Mumbach, Maxwell R', 'Pan, Zenggang', 'Murphy, Kenneth M', 'Natkunam, Yasodha', 'Chang, Howard Y', 'Kim, Jinah']","['Satpathy AT', 'Brown RA', 'Gomulia E', 'Briseno CG', 'Mumbach MR', 'Pan Z', 'Murphy KM', 'Natkunam Y', 'Chang HY', 'Kim J']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. satpathy@stanford.edu.', 'Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. satpathy@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180509,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2019/07/18 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-018-0052-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-018-0052-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2018 Sep;31(9):1479-1486. doi: 10.1038/s41379-018-0052-4.

However, recent clinical trials showed limited efficacy of FGFR-targeted therapy in lung SqCC, suggesting combination therapy may be necessary to improve patient outcomes. Here we demonstrate that FGFR therapy primes SqCC for cell death by increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. We therefore hypothesised that combining BH3-mimetics, potent inhibitors of pro-survival proteins, with FGFR-targeted therapy may enhance the killing of SqCC cells. Using patient-derived xenografts and specific inhibitors of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1, we identified a greater reliance of lung SqCC cells on BCL-XL and MCL-1 compared to BCL-2 for survival. However, neither BCL-XL nor MCL-1 inhibitors alone provided a survival benefit in combination FGFR therapy in vivo. Only triple BCL-XL, MCL-1, and FGFR inhibition resulted in tumour volume regression and prolonged survival in vivo, demonstrating the ability of BCL-XL and MCL-1 proteins to compensate for each other in lung SqCC. Our work therefore provides a rationale for the inhibition of MCL-1, BCL-XL, and FGFR1 to maximize therapeutic response in FGFR1-expressing lung SqCC.","['Weeden, Clare E', 'Ah-Cann, Casey', 'Holik, Aliaksei Z', 'Pasquet, Julie', 'Garnier, Jean-Marc', 'Merino, Delphine', 'Lessene, Guillaume', 'Asselin-Labat, Marie-Liesse']","['Weeden CE', 'Ah-Cann C', 'Holik AZ', 'Pasquet J', 'Garnier JM', 'Merino D', 'Lessene G', 'Asselin-Labat ML']","['ACRF Stem Cells and Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'ACRF Stem Cells and Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'ACRF Stem Cells and Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'ACRF Stem Cells and Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'ACRF Chemical Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Cancer Medicine, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'ACRF Chemical Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'ACRF Stem Cells and Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia. labat@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia. labat@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180510,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0268-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0268-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Aug;37(32):4475-4488. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0268-2.

Here we uncovered upregulated stem cell program in leukaemic lymphoblasts of patients with IKZF1 alterations by analysing the archived gene-expression profiling datasets. We then used a frequent IKZF1 deletion, IK6, as a model via transduction into human primitive haematopoietic cells, followed by xenotransplantation in mice. Immunophenotypically defined stem, pro-B, and immature/mature (IM/M)-B cells were collected from primary recipients for functional assay and transcriptome profiling.

Therefore, targeting these two deregulated pathways for therapy might yield synergistic treatment responses. We applied extracellular flux analysis to assess tumor metabolism. We found that combined treatment with ABT263 and Crizotinib synergistically reduces the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, which was dependent on dual inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The combination treatment led to enhanced apoptosis with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases. On the molecular level, c-MET-inhibition results in significant energy deprivation with a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory capacity and a suppression of intracellular energy production (ATP). In turn, loss of energy levels suppresses protein synthesis, causing a decline in anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 levels. Silencing of Mcl-1 enhanced ABT263 and MET-inhibitor mediated apoptosis, but marginally the combination treatment, indicating that Mcl-1 is the central factor for the induction of cell death induced by the combination treatment. Finally, combined treatment with BH3-mimetics and c-MET inhibitors results in significantly smaller tumors than each treatment alone in a PDX model system of glioblastoma. These results suggest that c-MET inhibition causes a selective vulnerability of GBM cells to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition.","['Zhang, Yiru', 'Ishida, Chiaki Tsuge', 'Shu, Chang', 'Kleiner, Giulio', 'Sanchez-Quintero, Maria J', 'Bianchetti, Elena', 'Quinzii, Catarina M', 'Westhoff, Mike-Andrew', 'Karpel-Massler, Georg', 'Siegelin, Markus D']","['Zhang Y', 'Ishida CT', 'Shu C', 'Kleiner G', 'Sanchez-Quintero MJ', 'Bianchetti E', 'Quinzii CM', 'Westhoff MA', 'Karpel-Massler G', 'Siegelin MD']","['Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, New York, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, New York, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, NY, New York, USA. ms4169@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180509,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crizotinib/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-25802-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-25802-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 May 9;8(1):7373. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-25802-0.,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '53AH36668S (Crizotinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",,PMC5943348,,,"['K08 NS083732/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS095848/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although EZH2 mutation is observed in certain lymphoma types, many other cancers show global H3K27me3 accumulation irrespective of mutation. However, the underlying mechanisms of gene silencing and therapeutic efficacies of epigenetic drugs remain unclear. In this study, we showed that globally-accumulated H3K27me3 is induced by both cis-bound EZH1 and EZH2 in mature lymphocyte-derived malignancies. Mutual interference and compensatory functions of co-expressed EZH1/2 rearrange the genome-wide distribution, establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Using novel EZH1/2 dual inhibitors, we found that both EZH1 and EZH2 are required for the maintenance and induction of H3K27me3. The synthetic lethality of targeting EZH1 and EZH2 was observed in lymphoma models and primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells harboring H3K27me3 accumulation. This heritable EZH1/2 dysfunctional state was epigenetically imprinted at the virus-infected, immortalized phase. EZH1/2 dual inhibition could eliminate infected cell populations more effectively than EZH2 inhibition. Regarding the frequent observation of H3K27me3 accumulation in advanced-stage and early-phase malignant progenitors, the emerging EZH1- and EZH2-dependent epigenetic reprograming is an incipient process of fate decision within developmental pathways of cancers.","['Yamagishi, Makoto']",['Yamagishi M'],"['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'EZH2', 'Epigenetic drug', 'Transcriptome']",2018/05/11 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.59.432 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2018;59(4):432-438. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.59.432.,"['0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, use of Moga before allo-HSCT could theoretically increase the risk of post-transplant complications like graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as Moga depletes regulatory T-cells (Tregs). We retrospectively assessed the impact of Moga on post-transplant outcomes using data from a nationwide survey. Pre-transplant administration of Moga was associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD and refractoriness to systemic corticosteroid for acute GVHD. The one-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was significantly higher in patients who were treated with Moga pre-transplant compared with those who were not (43.7% vs. 25.1%, P<0.01). The probability of one-year overall survival was also significantly lower in patients with pre-transplant Moga use compared to those without (32.3% vs. 49.4%, P<0.01).

This blocking occurs after the reverse transcription of viral RNA and ahead of integration into the host DNA, which is closely connected to the ability of the protein to bind the viral capsid. To date, Mx2s derived from nonprimate animals have shown no capacity for HIV-1 suppression. In this study, we examined the restrictive effect of equine Mx2 (eqMx2) on both equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and HIV-1 and investigated possible mechanisms for its specific function. We demonstrated that IFN-alpha/beta upregulates the expression of eqMx2 in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs). The overexpression of eqMx2 significantly suppresses the replication of EIAV, HIV-1, and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) but not that of murine leukemia virus (MLV). The knockdown of eqMx2 transcription weakens the inhibition of EIAV replication by type I interferon. Interestingly, data from immunofluorescence assays suggest that the subcellular localization of eqMx2 changes following virus infection, from being dispersed in the cytoplasm to being accumulated at the nuclear envelope. Furthermore, eqMx2 blocks the nuclear uptake of the proviral genome by binding to the viral capsid. The N-terminally truncated mutant of eqMx2 lost the ability to bind the viral capsid as well as the restriction effect for lentiviruses. These results improve our understanding of the Mx2 protein in nonprimate animals.IMPORTANCE Previous research has shown that the antiviral ability of Mx2s is confined to primates, particularly humans. EIAV has been shown to be insensitive to restriction by human MxB. Here, we describe the function of equine Mx2. This protein plays an important role in the suppression of EIAV, HIV-1, and SIVs. The antiviral activity of eqMx2 depends on its subcellular location as well as its capsid binding capacity. Our results showed that following viral infection, eqMx2 changes its original cytoplasmic location and accumulates at the nuclear envelope, where it binds to the viral capsid and blocks the nuclear entry of reverse-transcribed proviral DNAs. In contrast, huMxB does not bind to the EIAV capsid and shows no EIAV restriction effect. These studies expand our understanding of the function of the equine Mx2 protein.","['Ji, Shuang', 'Na, Lei', 'Ren, Huiling', 'Wang, Yujie', 'Wang, Xiaojun']","['Ji S', 'Na L', 'Ren H', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X']","['State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China wangxiaojun@caas.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180829,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/physiology/ultrastructure/virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Horses', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/genetics/*physiology', 'Interferon-alpha/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Macrophages/virology', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*Mx2', '*antiviral activity', '*capsid binding', '*equine infectious anemia virus', '*interferon', '*lentiviruses', '*position change']",2018/05/11 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00499-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00499-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Aug 29;92(18). pii: JVI.00499-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00499-18.

Development of CD47-targeted modalities is hindered by the ubiquitous expression of the target, often leading to rapid drug elimination and hemotoxicity including anemia. To overcome such liabilities, we have developed a fully human bispecific antibody, NI-1701, designed to coengage CD47 and CD19 selectively on B cells. NI-1701 demonstrates favorable elimination kinetics with no deleterious effects seen on hematologic parameters following single or multiple administrations to nonhuman primates. Potent in vitro and in vivo activity is induced by NI-1701 to kill cancer cells across a plethora of B-cell malignancies and control tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. The mechanism affording maximal tumor growth inhibition by NI-1701 is dependent on the coengagement of CD47/CD19 on B cells inducing potent antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of the targeted cells. NI-1701-induced control of tumor growth in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice was more effective than that achieved with the anti-CD20 targeted antibody, rituximab. Interestingly, a synergistic effect was seen when tumor-implanted mice were coadministered NI-1701 and rituximab leading to significantly improved tumor growth inhibition and regression in some animals. We describe herein, a novel bispecific antibody approach aimed at sensitizing B cells to become more readily phagocytosed and eliminated thus offering an alternative or adjunct therapeutic option to patients with B-cell malignancies refractory/resistant to anti-CD20-targeted therapy.

However, there remains a need for adjunct treatments to deepen response and to overcome drug resistance. Blinatumomab, a CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody (bsAb) designed in the BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager) format, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Because of its short half-life of 2.1 hours, blinatumomab requires continuous intravenous dosing for efficacy. We developed a novel CD19/CD3 bsAb in the single-chain Fv-Fc format (CD19/CD3-scFv-Fc) with a half-life of approximately 5 days. In in vitro experiments, both CD19/CD3-scFv-Fc and blinatumomab induced >90% killing of CLL cells from treatment-naive patients. Antileukemic activity was associated with increased autologous CD8 and CD4 T-cell proliferation, activation, and granzyme B expression. In the NOD/SCID/IL2Rgammanull patient-derived xenograft mouse model, once-weekly treatment with CD19/CD3-scFv-Fc eliminated >98% of treatment-naive CLL cells in blood and spleen. By contrast, blinatumomab failed to induce a response, even when administered daily. We next explored the activity of CD19/CD3-scFv-Fc in the context of ibrutinib treatment and ibrutinib resistance. CD19/CD3-scFv-Fc induced more rapid killing of CLL cells from ibrutinib-treated patients than those from treatment-naive patients. CD19/CD3-scFv-Fc also demonstrated potent activity against CLL cells from patients with acquired ibrutinib-resistance harboring BTK and/or PLCG2 mutations in vitro and in vivo using patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these data support investigation of CD19/CD3 bsAb's and other T cell-recruiting bsAb's as immunotherapies for CLL, especially in combination with ibrutinib or as rescue therapy in ibrutinib-resistant disease.","['Robinson, Hannah R', 'Qi, Junpeng', 'Cook, Erika M', 'Nichols, Cydney', 'Dadashian, Eman L', 'Underbayev, Chingiz', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Saba, Nakhle S', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Sun, Clare', 'Ahn, Inhye E', 'Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Rader, Christoph', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Robinson HR', 'Qi J', 'Cook EM', 'Nichols C', 'Dadashian EL', 'Underbayev C', 'Herman SEM', 'Saba NS', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Sun C', 'Ahn IE', 'Baskar S', 'Rader C', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL; and.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL; and.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180509,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2018/05/11 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2018/05/11 06:00'],"['2018/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)32025-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-830992 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Aug 2;132(5):521-532. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-830992.

There is currently no FDA-approved MDR modulator that can be used in clinic. Ceritinib, a selective ALK inhibitor, has been approved as the second-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we examined the role of ceritinib in leukemia associated MDR in therapy. METHODS: The cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. The flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of cell surface protein and to detect the accumulation and efflux of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) or doxorubicin (Dox) in cells. The RT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the gene expression and protein expression levels, respectively. RESULTS: We found that ceritinib enhanced the efficacy of substrate chemotherapeutic agent in ABCB1-overexpressing K562/adr leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo models, but neither in sensitive parental K562 leukemia cells nor in ABCC1-overexpressing HL-60/adr leukemia cells. Mechanistically, ceritinib significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of Rh123 or Dox but did neither alter ABCB1 expressions at both protein and mRNA levels nor block the phosphorylations of AKT and ERK1/2 at the concentration of MDR reversal. Importantly, ceritinib also increased the intracellular accumulation of Dox and enhanced the efficacy of Dox in primary leukemia cells in ex-vivo. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that ceritinib enhanced the efficacy of substrate chemotherapeutic agent on inhibition of leukemia cell growth in vitro, in vivo and ex-vivo, which linked to block ABCB1 function, pumping out its substrate conventional chemotherapeutic agent, thereby increasing the intracellular accumulation. These suggest the combination of ceritinib and substrate chemotherapeutic drugs maybe an effective treatment of resistant leukemia patients with ABCB1-mediated MDR.","['Yang, Li', 'Li, Manjun', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhen, Chen', 'Luo, Min', 'Fang, Xiaona', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Zhang, Jianye', 'Li, Qingshan', 'Fu, Liwu']","['Yang L', 'Li M', 'Wang F', 'Zhen C', 'Luo M', 'Fang X', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang J', 'Li Q', 'Fu L']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180505,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'ATP-binding cassette (ABC)', 'Ceritinib', 'Leukemia', 'Multidrug resistance (MDR)']",2018/05/10 06:00,2018/08/18 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['000489655 [pii]', '10.1159/000489655 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2018;46(6):2487-2499. doi: 10.1159/000489655.

A wide array of recurring genetic mutations involved in RNA splicing, histone manipulation, DNA methylation, transcription factors, kinase signaling, DNA repair, cohesin proteins, and other signal transduction elements has been identified as important substrates for the development of MDS. Cytogenetic abnormalities, namely those characterized by loss of genetic material (including 5q- and 7q-), have also been strongly implicated and may influence the clonal architecture which predicts such mutations and may provoke an inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment as the substrate for clonal expansion. Other aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of MDS continue to be further elucidated, predicated upon advances in gene expression profiling and the development of new, and improved high-throughput techniques. More accurate understanding of the genetic and molecular basis for the development of MDS directly provides additional opportunity for treatment, which to date remains limited.

Conditional survival reflects changing mortality risk with time since cancer diagnosis and is a useful measure for planning long-term follow-up care. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry 9 database, the authors identified a cohort of AYA patients diagnosed with a first malignant cancer between 1973 and 2009 and followed through 2014. They estimated 5-year relative survival at the time of diagnosis and at each additional year survived up to 25 years after diagnosis, conditional on the individual being alive at the beginning of that year. RESULTS: A total of 205,954 AYA patients with cancer were identified. Thyroid cancer, melanoma, testicular cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and central nervous system (CNS) tumors comprised 67% of all cancers. For all cancers combined, 5-year relative survival was 84.5% (95% confidence interval, 84.3%-84.7%) at 1 year after diagnosis and 94.0% (95% CI, 93.9%-94.2%) at 5 years. The relative survival first exceeded 95%, reflecting minimal excess mortality compared with the general population, at 7 years. Patients with thyroid cancer, testicular cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer reached a relative survival of >95% at the time of diagnosis and at 1, 3, and 18 years after diagnosis, respectively. Estimates for those with Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia were >95% at 6 and 13 years, respectively, but declined to <95% at 20 years. AYA individuals with CNS tumors did not reach 95% by 25 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: For AYA survivors of breast cancer, CNS tumors, and hematologic malignancies, long-term excess mortality should be considered when planning follow-up care. Cancer 2018;124:3037-43.

These new agents are much less toxic than chemoimmunotherapy and may be preferred for their superior efficacy in patients with certain high-risk features, such as del(17p). The place of these therapies in CLL management is becoming better defined, and they are gradually replacing traditional forms of chemoimmunotherapy.

It typically presents with an aggressive clinical course, responds poorly to standard chemotherapy, and carries a high risk for relapse. The landscape of Ph+ ALL therapy has changed favorably since the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). With the successful incorporation of TKIs into chemotherapy regimens, remissions occur more frequently and patients live longer. Imatinib was the first TKI that targeted the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein in Ph+ ALL. Since then, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib have been developed. Despite the significant progress that has been made in inducing remission, frequent relapses remain a challenge, especially among those with resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations. Still, the therapeutic armamentarium of ALL therapy is expanding at a breathtaking pace today compared with a decade ago. Novel drugs, such as potent later-generation TKIs, antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, are being developed and investigated in patients with Ph+ ALL. In this review, we summarize the current treatment options for Ph+ ALL and highlight the therapies that may become the standard of care in the near future.","['Yilmaz, Musa', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Yilmaz M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Short NJ', 'Jabbour E']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2018 Mar;16(3):216-223.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients present with pancytopenia and splenomegaly, owing to the infiltration of leukemic cells expressing CD22, CD25, CD20, CD103, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), annexin A1 (ANXA1), and the BRAF V600E mutation. A variant lacking CD25, ANXA1, TRAP, and the BRAF V600E mutation, called HCLv, is more aggressive and is classified as a separate disease. A molecularly defined variant expressing unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable 4-34 (IGHV4-34) is also aggressive, lacks the BRAF V600E mutation, and has a phenotype of HCL or HCLv. The standard first-line treatment, which has remained unchanged for the past 25 to 30 years, is single-agent therapy with a purine analogue, either cladribine or pentostatin. This approach produces a high rate of complete remission. Residual traces of HCL cells, referred to as minimal residual disease, are present in most patients and cause frequent relapse. Repeated treatment with a purine analogue can restore remission, but at decreasing rates and with increasing cumulative toxicity. Rituximab has limited activity as a single agent but achieves high complete remission rates without minimal residual disease when combined with purine analogues, albeit with chemotherapy-associated toxicity. Investigational nonchemotherapy options include moxetumomab pasudotox, which targets CD22; vemurafenib or dabrafenib, each of which targets the BRAF V600E protein; trametinib, which targets mitogen-activated protein kinase enzyme (MEK); and ibrutinib, which targets Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK).","['Kreitman, Robert J', 'Arons, Evgeny']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Arons E']","[""National Cancer Institute's Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."", ""National Cancer Institute's Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Standard of Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2018 Mar;16(3):205-215.,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,PMC6290912,,,"['Z01 BC010301-11/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NIHMS999261'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess viral lysis of the endosome, we monitored the ratio changes of mean fluorescence intensity in different time points by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Results: After incubating Jurkat cells with Ad5 and 80 mug/mL pHrodo dextran for 10 minutes, we observed the fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced at 30 minutes compared with that of endosomes at 0 minute. However, we found the mean fluorescence intensity was only slightly reduced by inhibiting V-ATPase with the bafilomycin A1 treatment.

TRAIL interacts with its cognate receptors that placed on cancer cells surface, including TRAIL-R1 (death receptor 4, DR4), TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5, DR5), TRAIL-R3 (decoy receptor 1, DcR1), TRAIL-R4 (decoy receptor 2, DcR2), and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Despite high apoptosis-inducing ability of TRAIL, various cancerous cells gain resistance to TRAIL gradually, and consequently TRAIL potential for apoptosis stimulation in these cells diminishes intensely. According to diverse ranges of examinations, intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, such as cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), apoptosis inhibitors (IAPs), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1), BCL-2, BCL-XL, and survivin play key role in cancer cells resistance to TRAIL. These proteins attenuate cancer cells sensitivity to TRAIL via various functions, importantly through caspase cascade suppression. The c-FLIP avoids from caspase 8 activation by FADD via binding to caspase 8 cleavage of FADD. Moreover, it activates signaling pathways that involved in cancer cells survival and proliferation. Intriguingly, it appears that the down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP is effectiveness goal for TRAIL-resistant cancers therapy, because their up-regulation in association with poor prognosis has been observed in various types of TRAIL-resistant cancers. In this review, we tried to collect and examine investigations that researchers have been able to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL through targeting of c-FLIP alone or with other intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins directly or indirectly. It seems that co-treatment of resistant cells by TRAIL with other therapeutic agents with the aim of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins inhibition is hopeful and attractive approach to overcome various TRAIL-resistant cancers.","['Hassanzadeh, Ali', 'Farshdousti Hagh, Majid', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza', 'Akbari, Ali Akbar Movassaghpour', 'Shams Asenjan, Karim', 'Saraei, Raedeh', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Hassanzadeh A', 'Farshdousti Hagh M', 'Alivand MR', 'Akbari AAM', 'Shams Asenjan K', 'Saraei R', 'Solali S']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180509,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics', 'Survivin/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*TRAIL', '*c-FLIP', '*intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins', '*resistance']",2018/05/10 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26585 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Oct;233(10):6470-6485. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26585.

We examined population-based survival outcomes of adults with BL treated with a modified combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone and systemic high-dose methotrexate (MTX) (CODOX-M) with IVAC (ifosfamide, mesna, etoposide, cytarabine and intrathecal MTX) (CODOX-M/IVAC) +/- rituximab over a 15-year period in British Columbia. For the 81 patients identified (including 8 with CNS involvement and 18 with human immunodeficiency virus-associated BL), 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% [95% confidence interval (CI): 63-83%] and 77% (95% CI: 66-85%), respectively, with no treatment-related deaths. Those who completed the regimen per protocol (n = 38) had significantly improved 5-year PFS 86% (P = 0.04) and OS 92% (P = 0.008), as did those under 60 years with 5-year PFS 82% (P = 0.005) and OS 86% (P = 0.002), which remained significant in multivariate analysis [PFS: hazard ratio (HR) 3.36, P = 0.018; OS HR 4.03, P = 0.012]. Incorporation of high-dose systemic methotrexate also significantly affected multivariate survival outcomes (OS HR 0.28, P = 0.025). Stem cell transplant in first remission had no effect on OS or PFS. This large, real-world analysis of BL patients treated with CODOX-M/IVAC +/- rituximab demonstrates excellent survival outcomes comparable to clinical trials. These results help to serve as a benchmark when comparing curative therapies for BL patients as novel regimens are incorporated into clinical practice.","['Zhu, Katie Y', 'Song, Kevin W', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Leitch, Heather', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Ramadan, Khaled', 'Slack, Graham W', 'Abou Mourad, Yasser', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Nantel, Stephen H', 'Narayanan, Sujaatha', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Power, Maryse M', 'Sanford, David S', 'Sutherland, Heather J', 'Tucker, Tracy', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Sehn, Laurie H', 'Broady, Raewyn', 'Gerrie, Alina S']","['Zhu KY', 'Song KW', 'Connors JM', 'Leitch H', 'Barnett MJ', 'Ramadan K', 'Slack GW', 'Abou Mourad Y', 'Forrest DL', 'Hogge DE', 'Nantel SH', 'Narayanan S', 'Nevill TJ', 'Power MM', 'Sanford DS', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Tucker T', 'Toze CL', 'Sehn LH', 'Broady R', 'Gerrie AS']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology, St. Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology, St. Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Genetics Laboratory, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Hematology, Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, BC Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180509,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Burkitt lymphoma', '*chemotherapy', '*population-based', '*stem cell transplant', '*treatment']",2018/05/10 06:00,2019/03/27 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15262 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Jun;181(6):782-790. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15262.

Obinutuzumab was developed to potentiate activity and overcome resistance. Pre-clinical data suggests obinutuzumab is superior to rituximab at effecting B cell depletion; however recent phase III clinical trial results have been mixed. The decision of which antibody to employ will probably be further complicated by the approval of a subcutaneous preparation of rituximab and several anti-CD20 biosimilars. Clinicians are now challenged with deciding whether to switch to obinutuzumab in approved settings, accepting the potential for increased toxicity and probable increased cost.

Previous studies have shown that dysfunction of SEC was associated with multiple human cancers, such as leukemia and breast cancer. However, the role of SEC in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development remains largely unknown. In this study, we found expression of AF4/FMR2 family member 4 (AFF4), the core component of SEC, was upregulated dramatically in HNSCC cell lines and tumor tissues. By using siRNA-mediated depletion and overexpression of AFF4, we demonstrated AFF4 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSCC cells. Moreover, we found AFF4 enhanced the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and sphere formatting activity and was required for the tumor-initiation capacity of stem-like cells in HNSCC cell lines. Mechanistically, we found the role of AFF4 in regulation of HNSCC cell behaviors was mainly mediated by sex-determining region Y box2 (SOX2), a critical regulator involved in development of several human cancers. SOX2 expression changed in parallel with AFF4 expression in response to depletion and overexpression of AFF4, respectively. More importantly, overexpression of SOX2 rescued the inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and ALDH activity induced by knockdown of AFF4 in HNSCC cells, at least in part. Collectively, our findings indicate AFF4 may serve as a biomarker and a potential target of therapies for patients with HNSCC.","['Deng, Peng', 'Wang, Jiongke', 'Zhang, Xuefeng', 'Wu, Xingyu', 'Ji, Ning', 'Li, Jing', 'Zhou, Min', 'Jiang, Lu', 'Zeng, Xin', 'Chen, Qianming']","['Deng P', 'Wang J', 'Zhang X', 'Wu X', 'Ji N', 'Li J', 'Zhou M', 'Jiang L', 'Zeng X', 'Chen Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2019/01/30 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['4993678 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgy046 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2018 Jul 3;39(7):937-947. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgy046.,"['0 (AFF4 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",,PMC6031063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in our collective biological understanding of MDS in the last decade, however, have made it possible to hope that effective therapeutics can be designed to improve MDS-associated cytopenias and patients' quality of life, and perhaps even delay clonal progression and extend survival. Classes of MDS-associated mutations and disordered biological pathways targeted by developmental therapeutics include the following: aberrant messenger RNA splicing, neomorphic enzymes in the citric acid cycle with oncogenic activity, overactivated tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases, epigenetic and chromatin remodeling alterations, abnormal telomere dynamics, and failed protection of DNA integrity. At present, treatments for MDS are usually administered as sequential monotherapy, but there is a trend toward clinical trials of combination therapies-in which new agents are added to a DNA hypomethylating agent backbone-for both upfront treatment and the treatment of relapsed/refractory disease. Agents in clinical trials for subsets of MDS include luspatercept, antibodies targeting CD33, isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors, deacetylase inhibitors, venetoclax, and immunotherapies designed to overcome immune checkpoint inhibition. These biologically based therapeutics, as well as the encouraging precedent of 7 new approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for the treatment of acute leukemia, offer the prospect that 10 more years will not elapse before another new therapy is approved for MDS.","['Brunner, Andrew M', 'Steensma, David P']","['Brunner AM', 'Steensma DP']","['Harvard Medical School, and Center for Leukemia at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,2018/05/10 06:00,2018/09/27 06:00,['2018/05/10 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2018 Jan;16(1):56-66.,,,PMC6629038,,,['P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['NIHMS1033086'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib on tube formation, cell viability, and gene expression of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found a distinct genetic profile in HUVECs treated with dasatinib, ponatinib, and nilotinib compared to bosutinib and imatinib, who resembled untreated samples. However, unique gene expression and molecular pathway alterations were detected between dasatinib, ponatinib, and nilotinib. Angiogenesis/blood vessel-related pathways and HUVEC function (tube formation/viability) were adversely affected by dasatinib, ponatinib, and nilotinib but not by imatinib or bosutinib. These results correspond to the differences in VAE profiles of these TKIs, support a direct effect on vascular cells, and provide direction for future research.","['Gover-Proaktor, Ayala', 'Granot, Galit', 'Pasmanik-Chor, Metsada', 'Pasvolsky, Oren', 'Shapira, Saar', 'Raz, Oshrat', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Leader, Avi']","['Gover-Proaktor A', 'Granot G', 'Pasmanik-Chor M', 'Pasvolsky O', 'Shapira S', 'Raz O', 'Raanani P', 'Leader A']","['a Felsenstein Medical Research Center , Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'a Felsenstein Medical Research Center , Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center , Petah-Tikva , Israel.', 'b Bioinformatics Unit, G.S.W.
