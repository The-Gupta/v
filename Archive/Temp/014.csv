Inactivation of the m6A mRNA reader YTHDF2, which recognizes m6A-modified transcripts to promote m6A-mRNA degradation, results in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion and compromises acute myeloid leukemia. Here we investigate the long-term impact of YTHDF2 deletion on HSC maintenance and multilineage hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that Ythdf2-deficient HSCs from young mice fail upon serial transplantation, display increased abundance of multiple m6A-modified inflammation-related transcripts, and chronically activate proinflammatory pathways. Consistent with the detrimental consequences of chronic activation of inflammatory pathways in HSCs, hematopoiesis-specific Ythdf2 deficiency results in a progressive myeloid bias, loss of lymphoid potential, HSC expansion, and failure of aged Ythdf2-deficient HSCs to reconstitute multilineage hematopoiesis. Experimentally induced inflammation increases YTHDF2 expression, and YTHDF2 is required to protect HSCs from this insult. Thus, our study positions YTHDF2 as a repressor of inflammatory pathways in HSCs and highlights the significance of m6A in long-term HSC maintenance.",['(c) 2020 Mapperley et al.'],"['Mapperley,

However, its role in cancer-macrophage interaction at the tumor environment is not known. In this study, the co-culture of the human metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (MHCC97L) stably transfected with a control vector (MHCC97L/P), or STC1-overexpressing vector (MHCC97L/S1) with human leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1) was conducted. We reported that MHCC97L/S1 suppressed the migratory activity of THP-1. Real-time PCR analysis revealed the downregulation of the pro-migratory factors, monocyte-chemoattractant protein receptors, CCR2 and CCR4, and macrophage-migratory cytokine receptor, CSF-1R. Transcriptomic analysis of the THP-1 cells co-cultured with either MHCC97L/P or MHCC97L/S1, detected 1784 differentially expressed genes. The Ingenuity Canonical Pathway analysis predicted that RhoA signaling was associated with the inhibition of the cell migration. Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction of Ser19-phosphorylation on MLC2, a Rho-A downstream target, in the THP-1 cells. Xenograft tumors derived from MHCC97/S1 in mice showed a remarkable decrease in infiltrating macrophages.

Induction-related mortality reported in the literature is approximately < 5% in clinical trials. However, the real-world scenario is different, especially in developing countries, given the high incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, high incidence of fungal pneumonia at baseline, and significant delay before initiation of chemotherapy. We aimed to look at contemporary infections and infection-related mortality and analyze the patterns of infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a large tertiary care oncology center in India. Patients with newly diagnosed AML who were older than age 15 years, considered fit for intensive therapy, and treated in the general wards of the adult hematolymphoid unit from March 1, 2014, until December 31, 2015, were included. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one patients were treated during the study period. The most common presenting complaint was fever (85%). The focus of infection at presentation was found in 63% of patients, with respiratory infection being the most common (47%). MDR organisms were isolated in 55% of patients during induction from various foci. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common blood culture isolate (42.9%). Fungal pneumonia was diagnosed in 55% of patients during induction despite antifungal prophylaxis. Treatment-related mortality was 10.7% in all phases, with an induction mortality rate of 7.4%. Complete remission was attained in 69% of patients. Of all patients who received induction chemotherapy, 74% completed all three consolidation cycles. The 121 patients were followed up for a median period of 53 months. Four-year event-free survival was 35.8%, and 4-year overall survival was 41.5%. CONCLUSION: Infections and infection-related mortality are major challenges during AML induction. Gram-negative MDR and fungal infections are particularly common in our region.",,"['Jain, Hasmukh', 'Rengaraj, Karthik', 'Sharma, Vibhor', 'Bonda, Avinash', 'Chanana, Raajit', 'Thorat, Jayashree', 'Ronghe, Ashwini', 'Biswas, Sanjay', 'Nayak, Lingaraj', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Subramnian, Papagudi', 'Shetty, Dhanalaxmi', 'Patkar, Nikhil', 'Bagal, Bhausaheb', 'Sengar, Manju']","['Jain H', 'Rengaraj K', 'Sharma V', 'Bonda A', 'Chanana R', 'Thorat J', 'Ronghe A', 'Biswas S', 'Nayak L', 'Tembhare P', 'Subramnian P', 'Shetty D', 'Patkar N', 'Bagal B', 'Sengar M']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Medical Resident, University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, affiliated to Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",PMC7713585,,2020/11/07 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/11/06 17:29'],"['2020/11/06 17:29 [entrez]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.20.00240 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Nov;6:1684-1695. doi: 10.1200/GO.20.00240.,1684-1695,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9947-7065', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3194-9935', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1022-6092', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7553-8257', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5239-0774', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9030-0415', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9107-5937', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9754-0182']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although clinicians perform TAB with an intent to confirm suspected GCA, some biopsies result in negative and some lead to non-GCA diagnoses. We aim to review the diagnoses after TAB biopsy performed for suspected GCA and also wanted to evaluate the diagnostic changes and concomitant diseases that develop over time. The patients who had undergone TAB for suspected GCA were identified using the record entry code for TAB. Patients meeting the classification criteria for GCA were designated as the GCA group and not meeting criteria were designated as a non-GCA group. Other classification criteria were implemented for the non-GCA group diseases. A total of 51 patients (Female: 62.7%, median age: 72.1 +/- 7.4 years) who had undergone TAB for suspected GCA were evaluated. TAB was positive in 23 (69.6%) of the 33 patients who met the GCA classification criteria. No significant difference was found between TAB-positive and TAB-negative GCA patients in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters. In the non-GCA group, 12 patients had isolated polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and the diagnoses of the remaining six patients were as follows: four large vessel vasculitis (LVV) not satisfying GCA diagnostic criteria, one chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and one amyloidosis. TAB was negative in all patients with isolated PMR. TAB showed primary amyloidosis in one patient. Out of 33 GCA patients, 21 had ""isolated"" GCA, four had GCA + Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), seven had GCA + PMR, and one had GCA + polymyositis. RA was diagnosed antecedent to GCA in two patients, and after GCA in the other two patients. One of the patients had developed GCA 20 years after polymyositis had been diagnosed. TAB was found to be positive in two-thirds of patients with suspected GCA. Late-onset RA and rarely other inflammatory rheumatic diseases may develop in the course of GCA.","['(c) 2020.

The therapeutic targets for CML patients mediated with BCR/ABL1 oncogenic are tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. The latter two of which have been approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or intolerance CML patients. Mitotic Catastrophe (MC) is one of the non-apoptotic mechanisms initiated in types of cancer cells in response to anti-cancer therapies. Pharmacological inhibitors of G2 checkpoint members or genetic suppression of PLK1, PLK2, ATR, ATM, CHK1, and CHK2 can trigger DNA-damage-stimulated mitotic catastrophe. PLK1 and AURKA/B are anomalously expressed in CML cells, where phosphorylation and activation of PLK1 occur by AURKB at centromeres and kinetochores. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dasatinib on the expression of genes in MC and apoptosis pathways in K562 cells. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from K-562 cells treated with the IC50 value of dasatinib and untreated cells as a control group. The expression of MC and apoptosis-related genes, was analyzed by the qRT-PCR system. RESULTS: The array-data demonstrated that dasatinib-treated K562 cells significantly caused the decrease of several genes (AURKA, AURKB, PLK, CHEK1, MYC, XPC, BCL2, and XRCC2).

However, identification of patients at increased risk is still a challenge. Knowing that both neutropaenia and gastrointestinal toxicity are risk factors for bacteraemia, we aimed at comparing absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and plasma citrulline levels (indicating enterocyte loss) in children with ALL with and without bacteraemia during induction treatment. PROCEDURE: We prospectively included 61 children with ALL treated according to the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-2008 protocol. ANC and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on treatment days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Plasma citrulline was measured on days 1, 8, 15 and 29. Bacteraemia episodes during induction treatment were recorded retrospectively. RESULTS: Nineteen of sixty-one (31%) patients experienced bacteraemia occurring on median day 13 (range 5-20). Patients with bacteraemia during induction treatment had lower citrulline level on day 15 (P < .01) compared to patients without bacteraemia, indicating more severe enterocyte loss. Nevertheless, ANC was similar in the two patient groups on days 8 and 15. CRP was negatively correlated with same-day citrulline (P < .03 for all) and ANC (P < .04 for all). CONCLUSIONS: During chemotherapy-induced neutropaenia, plasma citrulline may help identify patients at increased risk of bacteraemia.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['De Pietri, Silvia', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Christensen, Mette', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Rathe, Mathias', 'Muller, Klaus']","['De Pietri S', 'Frandsen TL', 'Christensen M', 'Grell K', 'Rathe M', 'Muller K']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."", 'OPEN, Odense Patient Data Explorative Network, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute for Inflammation Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '29VT07BGDA (Citrulline)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/blood/chemically induced/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Citrulline/*blood', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,2020/11/07 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/11/06 06:05'],"['2020/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/06 06:05 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28793 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Jan;68(1):e28793. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28793.

However, these ""BCR inhibitors"" function by interfering with B cell pathophysiology in a more complex way than anticipated, and resistance develops through multiple mechanisms. In ibrutinib treated patients, the most commonly described resistance-mechanism is a mutation in BTK itself, which prevents the covalent binding of ibrutinib, or a mutation in PLCG2, which acts to bypass the dependency on BTK at the BCR signalosome. However, additional genetic aberrations leading to resistance are being described (such as mutations in the CARD11, CCND1, BIRC3, TRAF2, TRAF3, TNFAIP3, loss of chromosomal region 6q or 8p, a gain of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/MYD88 signaling or gain of 2p chromosomal region). Furthermore, relative resistance to BTK inhibitors can be caused by non-genetic adaptive mechanisms leading to compensatory pro-survival pathway activation. For instance, PI3K/mTOR/Akt, NFkB and MAPK activation, BCL2, MYC, and XPO1 upregulation or PTEN downregulation lead to B cell survival despite BTK inhibition. Resistance could also arise from activating microenvironmental pathways such as chemokine or integrin signaling via CXCR4 or VLA4 upregulation, respectively. Defining these compensatory pro-survival mechanisms can help to develop novel therapeutic combinations of BTK inhibitors with other inhibitors (such as BH3-mimetic venetoclax, XPO1 inhibitor selinexor, mTOR, or MEK inhibitors). The mechanisms of resistance to PI3K inhibitors remain relatively unclear, but some studies point to MAPK signaling upregulation via both genetic and non-genetic changes, which could be co-targeted therapeutically. Alternatively, drugs mimicking the BTK/PI3K inhibition effect can be used to prevent adhesion and/or malignant B cell migration (chemokine and integrin inhibitors) or to block the pro-proliferative T cell signals in the microenvironment (such as IL4/STAT signaling inhibitors). Here we review the genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance and adaptation to the first generation of BTK and PI3K inhibitors (ibrutinib and idelalisib, respectively), and discuss possible combinatorial therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance or to increase clinical efficacy.",,"['Ondrisova, Laura', 'Mraz, Marek']","['Ondrisova L', 'Mraz M']","['Molecular Medicine, CEITEC Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.']",['eng'],['802644/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7116322,"['Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the', 'absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a', 'potential conflict of interest.']",2020/11/07 06:00,2020/11/07 06:01,['2020/11/06 06:00'],"['2020/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.591577 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 26;10:591577. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.591577.,591577,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell malignancies', 'B cell receptor', 'BCR inhibitor', 'adaptation', 'ibrutinib', 'resistance', 'targeted therapy']",['EMS101026'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implication of the immunogenomic landscape in the prognosis of patients with NK-AML has remained largely elusive. In the present study, the expression profiles of immune-related genes (IRGs) were examined and their association with overall survival (OS) was determined in 60 patients with NK-AML from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and 104 patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset no. GSE71014. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify 42 and 203 IRGs in the two respective cohorts, which were significantly associated with OS in NK-AML. A risk model was constructed based on the regression coefficient and expression values of nine survival-associated IRGs shared between the two datasets [zinc finger CCCH-type containing, antiviral 1 like; transferrin receptor; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; ELAV like RNA binding protein 1; roundabout guidance receptor 3; unc-93 homolog B1, Toll-like receptor signaling regulator; protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6; interleukin 2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL3RA]. Using this risk model, patients with NK-AML may be divided into high- and low-risk groups in prognostic predictions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting OS was 0.793. The prognostic role of this risk model was successfully verified in another independent cohort (GEO dataset no. GSE71014). The prognostic risk score was positively associated with age and fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 mutation and correlated with infiltration by T regulatory cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study provided an IRG score model for prognostic stratification of adult patients with NK-AML, as well as further insight into the implication of IRGs in NK-AML that may lead to the development of novel immunotherapy approaches for this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Dong, Xiaomin', 'Zhang, Danyang', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Chen, Xiaolei', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Zhou, Xiaohuan', 'Chen, Tingting', 'Zhou, Hebing']","['Dong X', 'Zhang D', 'Zhang J', 'Chen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou X', 'Chen T', 'Zhou H']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Beijing Luhe Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing 101149, P.R.

A promising strategy for MLS treatment is the prevention of sarcomagenesis by promoting the terminal differentiation of MLS cells into adipocytes. Previous studies have reported that the suppression of megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) expression induces adipocytic differentiation in preadipocyte cell lines. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of MKL1 suppression on MLS cells. In the present study, MKL1 knockdown was demonstrated to promote the adipocytic differentiation of an MLS-derived cell line, designated 1955/91, under adipogenic conditions. This suggests that therapeutic targeting of the MKL1-associated molecular pathway has potential as a promising method of MLS treatment. However, the induction of adipogenesis by MKL knockdown was incomplete, and Oil Red O staining indicated that intracellular lipid droplets were only sporadically generated. Conversely, MKL1 knockdown reduced the growth of the MLS cells. As adipocytic differentiation in vitro requires cellular confluence, the decreased growth rate of the MLS cells following MKL1 knockdown could be attributed to the incomplete induction of adipogenesis. Translocated in liposarcoma-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (TLS-CHOP) is an MLS-specific oncoprotein that is thought to play key roles in sarcomagenesis and the suppression of adipocytic differentiation. However, the results of western blotting analyses suggest that TLS-CHOP has limited effects on MKL1 expression in MLS cells and that MKL1 knockdown hardly affects TLS-CHOP expression. Thus, it is postulated that the inhibitory effect of TLS-CHOP on adipogenesis is not associated with MKL1 expression. However, MKL1 and the molecular pathway involving MKL1 appear to be attractive targets for the differentiation therapy of MLS.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Kamikawa, Yohei', 'Yokota, Kento', 'Oikawa, Kosuke', 'Sato, Fuyuki', 'Muragaki, Yasuteru']","['Kamikawa Y', 'Yokota K', 'Oikawa K', 'Sato F', 'Muragaki Y']","['Department of Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC7608058,,2020/11/07 06:00,2020/11/07 06:01,['2020/11/06 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2020.12232 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12232 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2020 Dec;20(6):369. doi: 10.3892/ol.2020.12232.

However, the effects of circRNAs on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain largely unexplored. We explored the function of circRAD18 in AML development. Methods: QRT-PCR was performed for the levels of circRAD18, RAD18, microRNA-206 (miR-206) and protein kinase CAMP-activated catalytic subunit beta (PRKACB). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay were utilized for cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to analyze cell apoptosis and cell cycle process. Transwell assay was manipulated for cell migration and invasion. Western blot assay was conducted for protein levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was adopted to verify the interaction between miR-206 and circRAD18 or PRKACB. Results: CircRAD18 level was increased in AML patients' blood specimens and AML cell lines compared to normal controls. CircRAD18 knockdown impeded the proliferation, migration and invasion and facilitated the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in AML cells. Moreover, circRAD18 was identified as a sponge for miR-206, and circRAD18 knockdown-mediated effect on AML cell progression was reversed by miR-206 suppression. Additionally, PRKACB was the target gene of miR-206. MiR-206 overexpression suppressed the malignant behaviors of AML cells, while PRKACB elevation restored the effects. Conclusion: CircRAD18 aggravated the malignancy of AML cells through reducing miR-206 expression and elevating PRKACB expression, indicating circRAD18 might be a therapeutic target for AML.",['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Yanyan', 'Guo, Te', 'Liu, Quan', 'Xie, Xianfei']","['Wang Y', 'Guo T', 'Liu Q', 'Xie X']","[""Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', ""Department of Orthopedics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC7608482,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],2020/11/07 06:00,2020/11/07 06:01,['2020/11/06 05:59'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/06 05:59 [entrez]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S277432 [doi]', '277432 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Oct 30;12:10887-10896. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S277432. eCollection 2020.,10887-10896,,20201030,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PRKACB', 'circRAD18', 'miR-206']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal profiles of inflammatory markers have been detected in neonatal blood spot samples of children who later developed B-ALL. However, how inflammatory signals contribute to B-ALL development is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Pax5 heterozygosis, in the presence of infections, results in the enhanced production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which appears to act in an autocrine fashion to promote leukemia growth. Furthermore, in vivo genetic downregulation of IL-6 in these Pax5 heterozygous mice retards B-cell leukemogenesis, and in vivo pharmacologic inhibition of IL-6 with a neutralizing antibody in Pax5 mutant mice with B-ALL clears leukemic cells. Additionally, this novel IL-6 signaling paradigm identified in mice was also substantiated in humans.

To gain further insight, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the kinetics of the murine BMM during B-ALL progression. Normal pro- and pre-B cells were found to be the most affected at the earliest stages of disease and this was associated with changes in expression of genes regulated by the AP1-transcription factor complex and regulatory factors NELFE, MYC and BCL11A. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors show reduced expression of the tumor suppressor long non-coding RNA Neat1 and disruptions in the rate of transcription. Intercellular communication networks revealed monocyte-dendritic precursors to be consistently active during B-ALL progression, with enriched processes including cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, neutrophil-mediated immunity and regulation of cell migration and proliferation. In addition, we confirmed that the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment was perturbed during leukemogenesis.

Libraries generated from immunized animals offer the advantage of in vivo affinity-maturation of V regions prior to library generation. Despite advantages, few studies have described isolation of antibodies from rats using immune phage display. In our study, we describe a novel primer set, covering the full rat heavy chain variable and kappa light chain variable regions repertoire for the generation of an unbiased immune libraries. Since the immune repertoire of rats is poorly understood, we first performed a deep sequencing analysis of the V(D)J regions of VH and VLK genes, demonstrating the high abundance of IGVH2 and IGVH5 families for VH and IGVLK12 and IGVLK22 for VLK. The comparison of gene's family usage in naive rats have been used to validate the frequency's distribution of the primer set, confirming the absence of PCR-based biases. The primers were used to generate and assemble a phage display library from human CD160-vaccinated rats. CD160 represents a valid therapeutic target as it has been shown to be expressed on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells and on the surface of newly formed vessels. We utilised a novel phage display panning strategy to isolate a high affinity pool (KD range: 0.399-233 nM) of CD160 targeting monoclonal antibodies. Subsequently, identified binders were tested for function as third generation Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR) T cells demonstrating specific cytolytic activity. Our novel primer set coupled with a streamlined strategy for phage display panning enable the rapid isolation and identification of high affinity antibodies from immunised rats. The therapeutic utility of these antibodies was demonstrated in CAR format.",,"['Nannini, Francesco', 'Parekh, Farhaan', 'Wawrzyniecka, Patrycja', 'Mekkaoui, Leila', 'Righi, Matteo', 'Dastjerdi, Fatemeh V', 'Yeung, Jenny', 'Roddie, Claire', 'Bai, Yuchen', 'Ma, Biao', 'Ferrari, Mathieu', 'Onuoha, Shimobi', 'Chester, Kerry', 'Pule, Martin']","['Nannini F', 'Parekh F', 'Wawrzyniecka P', 'Mekkaoui L', 'Righi M', 'Dastjerdi FV', 'Yeung J', 'Roddie C', 'Bai Y', 'Ma B', 'Ferrari M', 'Onuoha S', 'Chester K', 'Pule M']","['Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Research Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Research Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK.', 'Autolus Therapeutics, London, UK.', 'Autolus Therapeutics, London, UK.', 'Autolus Therapeutics, London, UK.', 'Autolus Therapeutics, London, UK.', 'Research Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Research Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6DD, UK. martin.pule@ucl.ac.uk.', 'Autolus Therapeutics, London, UK. martin.pule@ucl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['515707/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*isolation & purification', 'Cell Surface Display Techniques', '*Immunization', 'Rats', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/*immunology']",PMC7644676,,2020/11/07 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/11/06 05:55'],"['2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/06 05:55 [entrez]', '2020/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-76069-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-76069-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Nov 5;10(1):19168. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-76069-3.,19168,,20201105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy with tocilizumab and three doses of fresh frozen plasma was well tolerated. In spite of full resolution of the lung lesions, complete elimination of SARS-CoV-2 has not been achieved 4 months after the first detection, which is due to persistence of secondary immunodeficiency after HSCT and the lack of reconstitution of the adaptive immune response.

In this work, we performed a comprehensive comparison of three most commonly used data acquisition modes, including full-scan, data-dependent acquisition (DDA), and data-independent acquisition (DIA), using a metabolomics study of human plasma samples from leukemia patients before and after one-month chemotherapy. After optimization of data processing parameters, we extracted and compared statistically significant metabolic features from the results of each data acquisition mode. We found that most significant features can be consistently found in all three data acquisition modes with similar statistical performance as evaluated by Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Upon comparison, DDA mode consistently generated fewer uniquely found significant features than full-scan and DIA modes. We then manually inspected over 2000 uniquely discovered significant features in each data acquisition mode and showed that these features can be generally categorized into four major types. Many significant features were missed in DDA mode, primarily due to its low capability of detecting or extracting these features from raw LC-MS data. We thus proposed a bioinformatic solution to rescue these missing significant features from the raw DDA data with good reproducibility and accuracy. Overall, our work asserts that data acquisition modes can influence metabolomics results, suggesting room for improvement of data acquisition modes for untargeted metabolomics.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The dismal outcomes (15%-30%) after T-LBL relapse warrant establishing risk-based treatment. To our knowledge, this study presents the first comprehensive, systematic, integrated, genome-wide analysis including relapsed cases that identifies molecular markers of prognostic relevance for T-LBL. NOTCH1 was identified as the putative driver for T-LBL. An activated NOTCH/PI3K-AKT signaling axis and alterations in cell cycle regulators constitute the core oncogenic program for T-LBL. Mutated KMT2D was identified as a prognostic marker. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 47% +/- 17% in patients with KMT2D mutations, compared with 14% +/- 3% in wild-type KMT2D.

ILT3 overexpression in tumor cells induces immune escape of solid tumors and facilitates invasion of monocytic acute myeloid leukemia cells. However, the expression and function of ILT3 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells remain elusive. Herein, we found that ILT3 was enriched in human NSCLC cells, and predicted advanced disease and poor overall survival. ILT3 overexpression enhanced the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells and tubule formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by upregulating and interacting with its ligand apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in vitro. Mechanistically, ILT3 recruited SHP2 and SHIP1, and subsequently activated ERK1/2 signaling mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression in NSCLC cells, which are responsible for tumor cell motility and angiogenesis, respectively. Using murine metastasis models, we further confirmed ILT3 promoted NSCLC metastasis and explored the exact correlation of ILT3 with ApoE, EMT, and VEGF-A in vivo. These results unraveled novel mechanisms for ILT3-induced tumor progression and proposed ILT3 as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for NSCLC patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The first type of mutations tends to be in genes encoding members of the epigenetic/transcription regulatory machinery (i.e., RUNX1, DNMT3A, TET2), while the secondary mutations often involve genes encoding members of signaling pathways that cause uncontrolled growth of such cells such as the growth factor receptors c-KIT of FLT3. Patients usually present with both types of mutations, but it is currently unclear how both mutational events shape the epigenome in developing AML cells. To this end we generated an in vitro model of t(8;21) AML by expressing its driver oncoprotein RUNX1-ETO with or without a mutated (N822K) KIT protein. Expression of N822K-c-KIT strongly increases the self-renewal capacity of RUNX1-ETO-expressing cells. Global analysis of gene expression changes and alterations in the epigenome revealed that N822K-c-KIT expression profoundly influences the open chromatin landscape and transcription factor binding. However, our experiments also revealed that double mutant cells still differ from their patient-derived counterparts, highlighting the importance of studying patient cells to obtain a true picture of how gene regulatory networks have been reprogrammed during tumorigenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), a histone methyltransferase, is crucial for gene expression by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) in gene promoter. This study aimed to explore whether MLL1 is involved in EM-related infertility. The expressions of MLL1 and H3K4me3 were analyzed in the eutopic endometria from EM women with infertility (n = 22) and the normal endometria from EM-free women (n = 22). Mouse EM model was established. The MLL1 and H3K4me3 expression patterns in mice endometria of early pregnancy were also investigated. Immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (iESCs) were cultured and underwent in vitro decidualization. The chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed to find the target gene of MLL1 during decidual process. Results showed that both MLL1 and H3K4me3 decreased in the eutopic endometrium from EM patients compared to that in the normal endometrium. During early pregnancy and the decidual process, MLL1 and H3K4me3 were significantly upregulated in stromal cells. ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR found that the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I 2 (COX4I2) was directly targeted by MLL1. The dominance of COX4I2-containing enzyme induced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha), whose expression in the peri-implantation endometrium is essential for embryo implantation. Further results showed that MLL1 was directly regulated by progesterone (P4) - P4 receptors (PRs).

Animals serologically positive to BLV show a Th1 cytokine profile with a predominance of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma has antiviral activity through mechanisms such as resistance to infection, inhibition of viral replication and apoptosis. The objective of this work was to determine the transcription levels of IFN-gamma and its relationship with proviral load and persistent lymphocytosis in a population of Holstein cows of the province of Antioquia, Colombia. IFN-gamma transcription levels were evaluated by qPCR in 140 Holstein cows. A one-way analysis of variance and a Student's t test were used to evaluate the differences between the means. The amount of IFN-gamma mRNA found in BLV-positive cows was lower than in BLV-negative cows. Moreover, in the group of infected cows a lower level of IFN-gamma mRNA expression was found in BLV and persistent lymphocytosis cows (BLV+PL) compared with BLV and aleukemia cows (BLV+AL). The level of IFN-gamma mRNA expression was lower in cows with high proviral load (HPL) compared to cows with low proviral load (LPL). BLV infection is related to abnormal expression of IFN-gamma mRNA, although IFN-gamma has antiviral activity, its expression is affected by high proviral load.

Leukemia is caused by alterations of the genetic and epigenetic regulation of processes underlying hematologic malignancies, including SUMO modification (SUMOylation). Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins covalently or noncovalently conjugate and modify a large number of target proteins via lysine residues. SUMOylation is a small ubiquitin-like modification that is catalyzed by the SUMO-specific activating enzyme E1, the binding enzyme E2, and the ligating enzyme E3. SUMO is covalently linked to substrate proteins to regulate the cellular localization of target proteins and the interaction of target proteins with other biological macromolecules. SUMOylation has emerged as a critical regulatory mechanism for subcellular localization, protein stability, protein-protein interactions, and biological function and thus regulates normal life activities. If the SUMOylation process of proteins is affected, it will cause a cellular reaction and ultimately lead to various diseases, including leukemia. There is growing evidence showing that a large number of proteins are SUMOylated and that SUMOylated proteins play an important role in the occurrence and development of various types of leukemia. Targeting the SUMOylation of proteins alone or in combination with current treatments might provide powerful targeted therapeutic strategies for the clinical treatment of leukemia.",['(c) 2020 Wiley

We systematically reviewed studies (PubMed 1967-2019) reporting gene variants associated with both parkinsonism and cancer. Somatic variants were examined in cancer samples, whereas germline variants were examined in cancer patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic (carriers) genetic parkinsonisms. Pooled proportions were calculated with random-effects meta-analyses. Out of 9,967 eligible articles, 60 were included. Of the 28 genetic variants associated with parkinsonism, six were also associated with cancer. In cancer samples, SNCA was predominantly associated with gastrointestinal cancers, UCHL1 with breast cancer, and PRKN with head-and-neck cancers. In asymptomatic carriers, LRRK2 was predominantly associated with gastrointestinal and prostate cancers, PRKN with prostate and genitourinary tract cancers, GBA with sarcoma, and 22q11.2 deletion with leukemia. In symptomatic genetic parkinsonism, LRRK2 was associated with nonmelanoma skin cancers and breast cancers, and PRKN with head-and-neck cancers. Cancer was more often manifested in genetic parkinsonisms compared to asymptomatic carriers. These results suggest that intraindividual genetic contributions may modify the co-occurrence of cancer and neurodegeneration.","['(c) 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']","['Sturchio, Andrea', 'Dwivedi, Alok K', 'Vizcarra, Joaquin A', 'Chirra, Martina', 'Keeling, Elizabeth G', 'Mata, Ignacio F', 'Kauffman, Marcelo A', 'Pandey, Manoj K', 'Roviello, Giandomenico', 'Comi, Cristoforo', 'Versino, Maurizio', 'Marsili, Luca', 'Espay, Alberto J']","['Sturchio A', 'Dwivedi AK', 'Vizcarra JA', 'Chirra M', 'Keeling EG', 'Mata IF', 'Kauffman MA', 'Pandey MK', 'Roviello G', 'Comi C', 'Versino M', 'Marsili L', 'Espay AJ']","[""Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, 260 Stetson St., Cincinnati, OH45219, USA."", 'Division of Biostatistics & Epidemiology, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso, TX, USA.', ""Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, 260 Stetson St., Cincinnati, OH45219, USA."", 'Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Medical Oncology Unit, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', ""Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, 260 Stetson St., Cincinnati, OH45219, USA."", 'Lerner Research Institute, Genomic Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Consultorio y Laboratorio de Neurogenetica, Centro Universitario de Neurologia Jose Maria Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence, 50139Florence, Italy.', 'Neurology Unit, Department of Translational Medicine, Interdisciplinary Research Centre of Autoimmune Diseases, Movement Disorders Centre, University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy.', 'University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', ""Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, 260 Stetson St., Cincinnati, OH45219, USA."", ""Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, 260 Stetson St., Cincinnati, OH45219, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Germany,Rev Neurosci,Reviews in the neurosciences,8711016,,IM,"['Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/genetics', '*Parkinson Disease/genetics', '*Parkinsonian Disorders']",,,2020/11/06 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2020/11/05 12:12'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/05 12:12 [entrez]']","['10.1515/revneuro-2020-0083 [doi]', 'revneuro-2020-0083 [pii]']",epublish,Rev Neurosci. 2020 Nov 5;32(2):159-167. doi: 10.1515/revneuro-2020-0083.

Leukemia and tumors of the brain, soft tissues, breasts, adrenal glands, and bone are the most common cancers associated with this syndrome. Patients with LFS are very susceptible to radiation, therefore the use of whole-body MRI is recommended for regular cancer screening. It is important to recognize the common tumors associated with LFS on MRI, and it is also important to be aware of the high rate of false-positive lesions.

We conducted a prospective trial (clinicval.trials.gov NCT01025778) to explore the use of clofarabine-based chemotherapy as a bridge-to-transplant approach. Children with refractory acute leukemia were enrolled to receive two induction courses of clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (CloEC). Responding patients were scheduled for T-cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary objective was to improve survival by achieving sufficient disease control to enable stem cell transplantation. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety and toxicity. Seven children with active disease entered the study. Two children responded to induction courses and underwent transplantation. Five children did not respond to induction: one died in progression after the first course; two received off-protocol chemotherapy and were transplanted; and two succumbed to progressive leukemia. All transplanted children engrafted and no acute skin graft-versus-host disease > grade I was observed. One child is alive and well 7.5 years after the first CloEC course. One child developed fulminant adenovirus hepatitis and died in continuous complete remission 7 months after start of induction. Two children relapsed and died 6.5 and 7.5 months after enrollment. Infection was the most common toxicity. CloEC can induce responses in some patients with refractory acute leukemia but is highly immunosuppressive, resulting in substantial risk of life-threatening infections. In our study, haploidentical HSCT was feasible with sustained engraftment. No clinically significant organ toxicity was observed.

We here report the case of a 19-month-old female with a right temporal bone tumor that was ultimately diagnosed as DLBCL by tumor biopsy. There was no morphological evidence of bone marrow infiltration at diagnosis. The tumor nearly completely dissolved after scheduled chemotherapy for mature B-cell lymphoma; however, leukemic conversion occurred 2 months after completion of chemotherapy. Additional chemotherapy including hematopoietic cell transplantation in a non-remission state was unsuccessful, and disease progression ultimately resulted in the death of the patient 18 months after the diagnosis. We detected the KMT2A-MLLT3 fused transcript in the bone marrow of the patient with primary and recurrent cancer. RNA-sequencing of the bone marrow with recurrent cancer confirmed the KMT2A-MLLT3 fusion gene, although fusion genes involving BCL6, BCL2, or were not detected. Moreover, RNA-sequencing revealed overexpression of MEIS1 and MEF2C, which are highly expressed in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia, whereas the HOXA gene cluster was not overexpressed. The current case formed part of the KMT2A-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia cluster in a T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding plot.

With the increasing focus on prevention medicine, natural plant components are being used as a major source for the development of therapeutic drugs or functional foods to cure or alleviate the disease. Cedrus species are known to have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer effects; however, the anticancer effects of CAt extract have not been elucidated. In this study, CAt extract demonstrated an inhibitory effect on human leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner; CAt extract induced G0/G1 phase arrest via restrained protein levels of p-Rb and cell cycle-related proteins. After CAt extract exposure, the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated through caspase-8, -9, and -3 cleavage.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of chemotherapeutic treatments on the testicular histologic phenotype in prepubertal patients. A total of 56 testicular tissue samples from pediatric patients between 0 and 16 years old (28 with at least one previous chemotherapeutic onset and 28 untreated controls) were histologically analyzed and age-matched compared. At least two 5-mum sections from testis per patient separated by a distance of 100 mum were immunostained for the germ cell marker VASA, the spermatogonial markers UTF1, PLZF, UCHL1, and SALL4, the marker for proliferative cells KI67, and the Sertoli cell marker SOX9. The percentage of tubule cross-sections positive for each marker and the number of positive cells per tubule cross-section were determined and association with the cumulative dose received of each chemotherapeutic drug was statistically assessed. Results indicated that alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, but also the antimetabolite cytarabine and asparaginase were associated with a decreased percentage of positive tubules and a lower number of positive cells per tubule for the analyzed markers. Our results provide new evidences of the potential of chemotherapeutic agents previously considered to have low gonadotoxic effects such as cytarabine and asparaginase to trigger a severe testicular phenotype, hampering the potential success of future fertility restoration in experimental programs of fertility preservation in prepubertal boys.",,"['Medrano, Jose V', 'Hervas, D', 'Vilanova-Perez, T', 'Navarro-Gomezlechon, A', 'Goossens, E', 'Pellicer, A', 'Andres, M M', 'Novella-Maestre, E']","['Medrano JV', 'Hervas D', 'Vilanova-Perez T', 'Navarro-Gomezlechon A', 'Goossens E', 'Pellicer A', 'Andres MM', 'Novella-Maestre E']","['Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe (IIS La Fe), Av.

Hence, this multicenter, retrospective study aims to determine outcome predictors after retransplantation in relapsed ALL. We examined 55 recipients who underwent multiple allo-HCTs during 2006-2018. The 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and non-relapse mortality rates were 35.9%, 29.1%, and 23.6%, respectively. We observed a trend of better outcome in Ph + ALL (n = 22) patients compared with non-Ph ALL (n = 33) patients; the 2-year PFS was 40.9% versus 21.2%, indicating a beneficial effect of more potent second- or third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Univariate analysis revealed that late relapse after the previous transplant was the only significant predictor of better transplant outcome among Ph + ALL patients, whereas factors related to prolonged OS/PFS in non-Ph ALL patients were late relapse after the previous transplant, longer duration from disease relapse/progression to second or more allo-HCT, disease status at the transplantation, and good performance status. Nevertheless, further investigations are warranted to determine whether novel molecular-targeted agents with higher efficacy and fewer toxicities could exceed conventional chemotherapies as a bridging strategy to next allo-HCT and improve the outcomes of non-Ph ALL patients.",,"['Mori, Yasuo', 'Sasaki, Kensuke', 'Ito, Yoshikiyo', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Ueno, Toshiyuki', 'Kadowaki, Masanori', 'Aoki, Takatoshi', 'Sugio, Takeshi', 'Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Maeda, Takahiro', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro']","['Mori Y', 'Sasaki K', 'Ito Y', 'Kuriyama T', 'Ueno T', 'Kadowaki M', 'Aoki T', 'Sugio T', 'Yoshimoto G', 'Kato K', 'Maeda T', 'Nagafuji K', 'Akashi K', 'Miyamoto T']","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Harasanshin Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Center for Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, 3-1-1, Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan. toshmiya@intmed1.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*trends', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retreatment/mortality/trends', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Transplantation Conditioning/mortality/*trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/11/06 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/11/05 06:10'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/05 06:10 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04310-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04310-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jan;100(1):197-208. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04310-0.

Our objectives were to identify the prevalence of vertebral deformities and their risk factors among long-term childhood ALL survivors. METHODS/RESULTS: We recruited 245 (49% male) long-term childhood ALL survivors from the Preventing Late Adverse Effects of Leukemia Cohort (French-Canadian ALL survivors treated between the years 1987 and 2010 with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute clinical trials protocols, who did not experience disease relapse and/or receive hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Median age at recruitment was 21.7 years (range, 8.5-41) and median time since diagnosis was 15.1 years (range, 5.4-28.2). All participants underwent spine radiograph and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. The prevalence of vertebral deformity was 23% with 88% classified as grade 1 according to the Genant method. The majority of vertebral deformities were clinically silent. Regression analysis confirmed male sex (risk ratio [RR] = 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.24; P = 0.011), higher glucocorticoid cumulative dose (RR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.10; P = 0.032), and back pain (RR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.56-3.84; P < 0.001) as predictors of prevalent vertebral deformity. Sex differences in vertebral deformity predictors emerged. CONCLUSIONS: We report a significant prevalence of vertebral deformities in this young cohort. Male sex, cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and back pain were identified as predictors of prevalent vertebral deformity. Back pain emerging as a strong predictor of vertebral deformity underscores the importance of ongoing bone health surveillance in survivors with persistent vertebral deformities treated with these earlier protocols.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

However, patients after renal transplantation are at a higher risk of developing different complications connected not only with surgical procedure but also with immunosuppressive treatment, chronic kidney disease progression and rejection processes. Various blood disorders can develop in post-transplant patients ranging from relatively benign anaemia through cytopenias to therapy-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders followed by a rare and fatal condition of thrombotic microangiopathy and haemophagocytic syndrome. So far literature mainly focused on the post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.

The aim of the ALL-HR-11 trial was to evaluate the outcomes of HR Ph- adult ALL patients following chemotherapy or allo-HSCT administered based on end-induction and consolidation MRD levels. Patients aged 15 to 60 years with HR-ALL in complete response (CR) and MRD levels (centrally assessed by 8-color flow cytometry) <0.1% after induction and <0.01% after early consolidation were assigned to receive delayed consolidation and maintenance therapy up to 2 years in CR. The remaining patients were allocated to allo-HSCT. CR was attained in 315/348 patients (91%), with MRD <0.1% after induction in 220/289 patients (76%). By intention-to-treat, 218 patients were assigned to chemotherapy and 106 to allo-HSCT. The 5-year (+/-95% confidence interval) cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival probabilities for the whole series were 43% +/- 7%, 49% +/- 7%, and 40% +/- 6%, respectively, with CIR and OS rates of 45% +/- 8% and 59% +/- 9% for patients assigned to chemotherapy and of 40% +/- 12% and 38% +/- 11% for those assigned to allo-HSCT, respectively. Our results show that avoiding allo-HSCT does not hamper the outcomes of HR Ph- adult ALL patients up to 60 years with adequate MRD response after induction and consolidation. Better postremission alternative therapies are especially needed for patients with poor MRD clearance.

We investigated relapse risk following suboptimal asparaginase exposure among 1401 children aged 1 to 17 years, diagnosed with ALL between July 2008 and February 2016, treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol (including extended asparaginase exposure [1000 IU/m2 intramuscularly weeks 5-33]). Patients were included with delayed entry at their last administered asparaginase treatment, or detection of SI, and followed until relapse, death, secondary malignancy, or end of follow-up (median, 5.71 years; interquartile range, 4.02-7.64). In a multiple Cox model comparing patients with (n = 358) and without (n = 1043) truncated asparaginase treatment due to clinical toxicity, the adjusted relapse-specific hazard ratio (HR; aHR) was 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-2.06; P = .20). In a substudy including only patients with information on enzyme activity (n = 1115), the 7-year cumulative incidence of relapse for the 301 patients with truncation of asparaginase treatment or SI (157 hypersensitivity, 53 pancreatitis, 14 thrombosis, 31 other, 46 SI) was 11.1% (95% CI, 6.9-15.4) vs 6.7% (95% CI, 4.7-8.6) for the 814 remaining patients. The relapse-specific aHR was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.05-2.74, P=.03). The unadjusted bone marrow relapse-specific HR was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.07-3.14, P=.03) and 1.86 (95% CI, 0.90- 3.87, P=.095) for any central nervous system relapse.

They are exceptionally rare entities with a low morbidity and a poor prognosis. Case presentation: An 11-year-old boy presented with an anterior mediastinal mass diagnosed as a malignant germ cell tumor on the basis of an excisional biopsy. He was found to have acute myeloid leukemia (AML) two years after the chemotherapy for his germ cell tumor. The clinical course was very aggressive with a survival time of only 1 week after diagnosis of AML associated with PMGCT. Conclusion: AML associated with PMGCT needs to be diagnosed correctly. Relevant examinations should be carried out in patients with PMGCTs during and after chemotherapy, and long-term follow-up is still necessary to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

However, NSCLC patients are inclined to develop acquired gefitinib drug resistance through nowadays, unarticulated mechanisms of chemoresistance. Here, we investigated the role of TF (Trifolium flavonoids) on sensitizing gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells and revealed its potential mechanism of action. We demonstrated that TF exerted significantly potential chemosensitivity in gefitinib resistant NSCLC cells. MTT assay and cytological methods were used to analyze cell viability and apoptosis in NSCLC cell line PC-9R. Both TF and gefitinib suppressed PC-9R cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Subtoxic concentrations of TF did significantly augment gefitinib-induced apoptosis in PC-9R cell line. The TF promoted chemosensitivity was major mediated by the PARP and caspases activation. Meanwhile, the TF promoted chemosensitivity also decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Finally, TF significantly reduced the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 and ERK. Altogether, the results of the present study indicated the potential mechanisms of chemosensitivity of TF in gefitinib-induced apoptosis of NSCLC by downregulating ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways and Bcl2 and Mcl-1 expression and a promising application of TF in therapy of NSCLC with gefitinib resistant.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhiqiang Wu et al.'],"['Wu, Zhiqiang', 'Xu, Bin', 'Yu, Zhiyi', 'He, Qin', 'Hu, Zhuyuan', 'Zhou, Shishi', 'Chen, Meiqin', 'Zhu, Liang']","['Wu Z', 'Xu B', 'Yu Z', 'He Q', 'Hu Z', 'Zhou S', 'Chen M', 'Zhu L']","['Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.', 'Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Flavonoids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Gefitinib/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Respiratory Mucosa/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trifolium/*chemistry', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7603574,['All authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.'],2020/11/06 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/11/05 06:08'],"['2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/05 06:08 [entrez]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/2491304 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Oct 22;2020:2491304. doi: 10.1155/2020/2491304. eCollection 2020.,2491304,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0792-3313'],20201022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells treated with Zeocin and untreated cells underwent RT-qPCR analysis to determine cell apoptosis through gene expression in relation to each cell's deformation profile. Results showed that untreated cells with 43.05 +/- 6.68 Pa are more elastic compared to the treated cells with 15.81 +/- 2.94 Pa. THP-1 monocyte's elastic modulus is indicative of cell apoptosis shown by upregulated genes after Zeocin treatment.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in cancer progression has been reported frequently. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and explore a novel mechanism in NSCLC development. Materials and Methods: The expression of MALAT1, copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing 8 (COMMD8) and microRNA-613 (miR-613) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein levels of COMMD8, Cyclin D1, Ki67, B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), CD63 and CD81 were determined by Western blot. Cell proliferation, the number of colonies and cell apoptosis were assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Glycolysis was distinguished based on glucose consumption, lactate production and LDHA activity. The role of MALAT1 in vivo was verified by animal experiments. The relationship between miR-613 and MALAT1 or COMMD8 was predicted by the bioinformatics tool starbase and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The exosomes were isolated using the corresponding kit and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Results: MALAT1 and COMMD8 were aberrantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. MALAT1 or COMMD8 knockdown blocked cell proliferation, colony formation and glycolysis but accelerated cell apoptosis in vitro. Besides, MALAT1 knockdown reduced tumor growth in vivo. We found that miR-613 was a target of MALAT1, and miR-613 could bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of COMMD8. MALAT1 regulated the expression of COMMD8 by absorbing miR-613. Moreover, the extracellular MALAT1 was transmitted by wrapping into exosomes. Conclusion: MALAT1 promoted malignant activities of NSCLC cells through targeting miR-613/COMMD8 axis, and exosome-mediated transfer of NSCLC might be a novel approach for NSCLC treatment.",['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Shouzhong', 'Wang, Tao', 'Liu, Darui', 'Kong, Haiyan']","['Wang S', 'Wang T', 'Liu D', 'Kong H']","[""Department of Minimally Invasive Intervention Center, Zaozhuang Tumor Hospital, Zaozhuang, Shandong 277500, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Minimally Invasive Intervention Center, Zaozhuang Tumor Hospital, Zaozhuang, Shandong 277500, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Tengzhou Central People's Hospital, Zaozhuang, Shandong 277500, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tengzhou Central People's Hospital, Tengzhou, Shandong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC7605591,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests for this work.'],2020/11/06 06:00,2020/11/06 06:01,['2020/11/05 06:06'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/05 06:06 [entrez]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S263538 [doi]', '263538 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Oct 29;12:10735-10747. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S263538. eCollection 2020.,10735-10747,,20201029,['NOTNLM'],"['COMMD8', 'MALAT1', 'NSCLC', 'exosome', 'miR-613']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we studied clinical cohorts of patients with B cell leukaemia and lymphoma, and identified IFITM3 as a strong predictor of poor outcome. In normal resting B cells, IFITM3 was minimally expressed and mainly localized in endosomes. However, engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) induced both expression of IFITM3 and phosphorylation of this protein at Tyr20, which resulted in the accumulation of IFITM3 at the cell surface. In B cell leukaemia, oncogenic kinases phosphorylate IFITM3 at Tyr20, which causes constitutive localization of this protein at the plasma membrane. In a mouse model, Ifitm3(-/-) naive B cells developed in normal numbers; however, the formation of germinal centres and the production of antigen-specific antibodies were compromised. Oncogenes that induce the development of leukaemia and lymphoma did not transform Ifitm3(-/-) B cells. Conversely, the phosphomimetic IFITM3(Y20E) mutant induced oncogenic PI3K signalling and initiated the transformation of premalignant B cells. Mechanistic experiments revealed that IFITM3 functions as a PIP3 scaffold and central amplifier of PI3K signalling. The amplification of PI3K signals depends on IFITM3 using two lysine residues (Lys83 and Lys104) in its conserved intracellular loop as a scaffold for the accumulation of PIP3. In Ifitm3(-/-) B cells, lipid rafts were depleted of PIP3, which resulted in the defective expression of over 60 lipid-raft-associated surface receptors, and impaired BCR signalling and cellular adhesion. We conclude that the phosphorylation of IFITM3 that occurs after B cells encounter antigen induces a dynamic switch from antiviral effector functions in endosomes to a PI3K amplification loop at the cell surface. IFITM3-dependent amplification of PI3K signalling, which in part acts downstream of the BCR, is critical for the rapid expansion of B cells with high affinity to antigen. In addition, multiple oncogenes depend on IFITM3 to assemble PIP3-dependent signalling complexes and amplify PI3K signalling for malignant transformation.",,"['Lee, Jaewoong', 'Robinson, Mark E', 'Ma,

To better understand resistance to FLT3 inhibition, we examined FLT3-ITD positive cell lines which had acquired resistance to midostaurin or sorafenib. In 6 out of 23 TKI resistant cell lines we were able to detect a JAK1 V658F mutation, a mutation that led to reactivation of the CSF2RB-STAT5 pathway. Knockdown of JAK1, or treatment with a JAK inhibitor, resensitized cells to FLT3 inhibition. Out of 136 patients with FLT3-ITD mutated AML and exposed to FLT3 inhibitor, we found seven different JAK family mutations in six of the cases (4.4%), including five bona fide, activating mutations. Except for one patient, the JAK mutations occurred de novo (n = 4) or displayed increasing variant allele frequency after exposure to FLT3 TKI (n = 1). In vitro each of the five activating variants were found to induce resistance to FLT3-ITD inhibition, which was then overcome by dual FLT3/JAK inhibition. In conclusion, our data characterize a novel mechanism of resistance to FLT3-ITD inhibition and may offer a potential therapy, using dual JAK and FLT3 inhibition.",,"['Rummelt, Christoph', 'Gorantla, Sivahari P', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Charlet, Anne', 'Endres, Cornelia', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Duyster, Justus', 'von Bubnoff, Nikolas']","['Rummelt C', 'Gorantla SP', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Charlet A', 'Endres C', 'Dohner K', 'Heidel FH', 'Fischer T', 'Haferlach T', 'Duyster J', 'von Bubnoff N']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin 2, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin C, Universitatsmedizin Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Center, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.

The bone marrow microenvironment plays a critical role in the development and progression of AML. However, the characteristics of the genetic mutation-associated microenvironment have not been comprehensively identified to date. In this study, we obtained the gene expression profiles of 173 AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and calculated their immune and stromal scores by applying the ESTIMATE algorithm. Immune scores were significantly associated with OS and cytogenetic risk. Next, we categorized the intermediate and poor cytogenetic risk patients into individual-mutation and wild-type groups according to RUNX1, ASXL1, TP53, FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA mutation status. The relationships between the immune microenvironment and each genetic mutation were investigated by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and conducting functional enrichment analyses of them. Significant immune- and stromal-relevant DEGs associated with each mutation were identified, and most of the DEGs (from the FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA mutation groups) were validated in the GSE14468 cohort downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. In summary, we identified key immune- and stromal-relevant gene signatures associated with genetic mutations in AML, which may provide new biomarkers for risk stratification and personalized immunotherapy.",,"['Wang, Jun', 'Dao, Feng-Ting', 'Yang, Lu', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen']","['Wang J', 'Dao FT', 'Yang L', 'Qin YZ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China. qin2000@aliyun.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",PMC7643165,,2020/11/06 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/11/05 06:02'],"['2020/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/05 06:02 [entrez]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-76048-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-76048-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Nov 4;10(1):19037. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-76048-8.,19037,,20201104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease (MRD; 10(-5)) was assessed via the clonoSEQ((R)) assay V2.0. 569 patients were randomized (D-Rd, n = 286; Rd, n = 283); 35 (12%) patients per group had high cytogenetic risk.

Responses with D-Rd were deep, including higher MRD negativity and sustained MRD-negativity rates versus Rd, regardless of cytogenetic risk. PFS on subsequent line of therapy was improved with D-Rd versus Rd in both cytogenetic risk subgroups. The safety profile of D-Rd by cytogenetic risk was consistent with the overall population.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study included 77 patients from hematology department of Poltava Regional Hospital, who were divided into 3 groups according to the underlying disease: Group 1 - patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (n = 26 ) groups and 2 - patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 27 ), group 3 - patients with multiple myeloma (MM) ( n = 24 ). For the examined patients were taken electroneuromyographyc researches of distal lower extremities by measuring the following parameters: the amplitude of the M-response from short extensors nerves of the fingers ( MEDB) and abductor of the big toe ( MAH) and the rate of excitation the spread of short extensors nerve of the fingers ( VEDB), thumb abductor ( VAH), superficial shallow ( VSF) and calf ( VC) nerves on both sides (sin/dex ) before and after administration of alpha- lipoic acid. RESULTS: Results: ENMG examination of the peripheral nerves of the lower extremities in patients with CML and CLL revealed a slight decrease in M-responses at normal values of the rate of conduction of excitation through sensory and motor fibers. In patients with MM, multiple lesions of peripheral nerve fibers of the lower extremities were detected, which is represented by a decrease in the M-response and the rate of excitation through sensory fibers and indicates deeper lesions, namely the axial cylinder, which requires longer treatment. The difference in the dynamics of the studied indicators indicates a different degree of PNP. Administration of alpha-lipoic acid increased the M-response rate and the rate of excitation of motor fibers in all groups of patients. The rate of excitation through sensory fibers was improved in patients with CLL and MM. Following the use of alpha-lipoic acid in the complex treatment of patients with MM ENMG, the signs of peripheral nerve fiber damage in the lower extremities were worse due to the severe initial condition, but reached a medium level. The positive effect of alpha-lipoic acid can be caused by a decrease in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in nerve vessels, and, as a consequence, an improvement in the trophism and functional state of nerve fibers. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: ENMG signs of defeat of PNP of the lower extremities are more expressed at MM. The appointment of alpha-lipoic acid in the complex treatment of PNP in patients with chronic hemoblastosis improves the functional state of the peripheral nerve fibers of the lower extremities and may be a component of pathogenetic therapy.",,"['Piddubna, Oleksandra O', 'Lytvynenko, Nataliya V', 'Krivchun, Anzhelina M', 'Taryanyk, Kateryna A']","['Piddubna OO', 'Lytvynenko NV', 'Krivchun AM', 'Taryanyk KA']","['UKRAINIAN MEDICAL STOMATOLOGICAL ACADEMY, POLTAVA, UKRAINE.', 'UKRAINIAN MEDICAL STOMATOLOGICAL ACADEMY, POLTAVA, UKRAINE.', 'UKRAINIAN MEDICAL STOMATOLOGICAL ACADEMY, POLTAVA, UKRAINE.', 'UKRAINIAN MEDICAL STOMATOLOGICAL ACADEMY, POLTAVA, UKRAINE.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Poland,Wiad Lek,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",9705467,['73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)'],IM,"['Electromyography', 'Humans', 'Lower Extremity', 'Nerve Fibers', '*Polyneuropathies/drug therapy', '*Thioctic Acid/therapeutic use']",,,2020/11/06 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/11/05 05:58'],"['2020/11/05 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Wiad Lek. 2020;73(9 cz. 2):1990-1994.,1990-1994,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic hemoblastosis-', 'electroneuromyographic-', 'peripheral nervous system-', 'polyneuropathy-', 'alpha-lipoic acid -']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SETTING: All hospitals departments, diagnostic centres and social security agencies in Sardinia were regularly screened in 1974-2003 to identify, register and review the diagnoses of incident cases of haematological malignancies (HM). PARTICIPANTS: The whole child population aged 0-14 resident in Sardinia. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and time trend of childhood HM and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over the study period, and use of Bayesian methods to plot the probability of areas with excess incidence on the regional map. RESULTS: Overall, 675 HM cases, including 378 ALL cases, occurred among children aged 0-14 years resident in Sardinia in 1974-2003, with an incidence rate of 6.97x10(-5) (95% CI 6.47 to 7.51) and 3.85x10(-5) (95% CI 3.48 to 4.26), respectively. Incidence of HM and ALL showed an upward trend along the study period especially among females. Three communes out of the 356 existing in 1974, namely Ittiri, Villa San Pietro and Carbonia, stand out as areas with excess incidence of HM and ALL in particular and another, Carloforte, for ALL only. CONCLUSIONS: Our results might serve as convincing arguments for extending the coverage of routine cancer registration over the whole Sardinian population, while prompting further research on the genetic and environmental determinants in the areas at risk.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

However, redirection to a tumor-associated antigen by the introduction of a transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR) reduces anti-viral activity, thereby impeding the possibility of preventing or treating two distinct complications-malignant relapse and viral infection-with a single cell therapy product. Availability of CD8alphabeta co-receptor molecules can significantly impact class I restricted T-cell activation, and thus, we interrogated whether transgenic CD8alphabeta improves anti-viral activity mediated by native VSTs with or without a co-expressed transgenic TCR (TCR8). METHODS: Our existing clinical VST manufacturing platform was adapted and validated to engineer TCR+ or TCR8+ VSTs targeting cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Simultaneous anti-viral and anti-tumor function of engineered VSTs was assessed in vitro and in vivo. We used pentamer staining, interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), cytotoxicity assays, co-cultures, and cytokine secretion assays for the in vitro characterization. The in vivo anti-tumor function was assessed in a leukemia xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: Both transgenic CD8alphabeta alone and TCR8 had significant impact on the anti-viral function of engineered VSTs, and TCR8+ VSTs had comparable anti-viral activity as non-engineered VSTs as determined by IFN-gamma ELISpot, ICS and cytotoxicity assays. TCR8-engineered VSTs had improved anti-tumor function and greater effector cytokine production in vitro, as well as enhanced anti-tumor function against leukemia xenografts in mice. CONCLUSION: Incorporation of transgenic CD8alphabeta into vectors for TCR-targetable antigens preserves anti-viral activity of TCR transgenic VSTs while simultaneously supporting tumor-directed activity mediated by a transgenic TCR. Our approach may provide clinical benefit in preventing and treating viral infections and malignant relapse post-transplant.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

However, subsets of patients do not respond or eventually acquire resistance. Venetoclax-based regimens can lead to considerable marrow suppression in some patients. Bromodomain and extraterminal inhibitors (BETi) are potential treatments for AML, as regulators of critical AML oncogenes. We tested the efficacy of novel BET inhibitor INCB054329, and its synergy with venetoclax to reduce AML without induction of hematopoietic toxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: INCB054329 efficacy was assessed by changes in cell cycle and apoptosis in treated AML cell lines. In vivo efficacy was assessed by tumor reduction in MV-4-11 cell line-derived xenografts. Precision run-on and sequencing (PRO-seq) evaluated effects of INCB054329. Synergy between low-dose BETi and venetoclax was assessed in cell lines and patient samples in vitro and in vivo while efficacy and toxicity was assessed in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. RESULTS: INCB054329 induced dose-dependent apoptosis and quiescence in AML cell lines. PRO-seq analysis evaluated the effects of INCB054329 on transcription and confirmed reduced transcriptional elongation of key oncogenes, MYC and BCL2, and genes involved in the cell cycle and metabolism. Combinations of BETi and venetoclax led to reduced cell viability in cell lines and patient samples.

A haploidentical (haplo) or matched unrelated donor (UD) is a valid option in the absence of a matched related donor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the outcomes of patients with acute leukemia who underwent haplo bone marrow (haplo-BM, N = 401) versus UD mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (UD-PB, N = 192) transplantation in the setting of PTCy. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 36 months in the haplo-BM group and 16.6 months in the UD-PB group, respectively (P < 0.01). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 64.6% and 42.7% of haplo-BM and UD-PB patients, respectively (P < 0.01). Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 30 was 87% in haplo-BM versus 94% in UD-PB, respectively (P = 0.21). In the multivariate analysis, the risk of grade 2-4 acute GvHD (HR = 0.53, P = 0.01) and chronic GvHD (HR = 0.50, P = 0.02) was significantly lower in the haplo-BM group compared with the UD-PB group. There was no significant difference between the study groups with respect to relapse incidence, nonrelapse mortality, leukemia-fee survival, overall survival, or GvHD-free and relapse-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a haplo donor with a BM graft resulted in a lower incidence of GvHD compared with a UD-PB stem cell graft in the setting of PTCy for patients with acute leukemia. However, differences in GvHD did not translate into a difference in survival outcomes. Based upon these data, UD-PB or haplo-BM should be considered equally acceptable sources for allo-HCT.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Nagler, Arnon', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Sica, Simona', 'Meijer, Ellen', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Van Gorkom, Gwendolyn', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Martin, Hans', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Risitano, Antonio', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Nagler A', 'Labopin M', 'Dholaria B', 'Angelucci E', 'Afanasyev B', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Sica S', 'Meijer E', 'Ciceri F', 'Van Gorkom G', 'Kroger N', 'Martin H', 'Pioltelli P', 'Risitano A', 'Canaani J', 'Savani BN', 'Sanz J', 'Mohty M']","['Division of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'EBMT ALWP office Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT ALWP office Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. bhagirathbhai.r.dholaria@vumc.org.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico, San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Institute for Paediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Transplantation, First State Pavlov Medical University of St. Petersburg, Raisa Gorbacheva Memorial Research, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Ematologia, Universita Cattolica S.

The reapproval of Mylotarg, an anti-CD33-calicheamicin antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has provided a proof of concept for an ADC-based therapeutic for AML. Several other ADCs have since entered clinical development of AML, but have met with limited success. We sought to develop a next-generation ADC for AML with a wide therapeutic index (TI) that overcomes the shortcomings of previous generations of ADCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the TI of our novel CD33-targeted ADC platform with other currently available CD33-targeted ADCs in preclinical models of AML. Next, using this next-generation ADC platform, we performed a head-to-head comparison of two attractive AML antigens, CD33 and CD123. RESULTS: Our novel ADC platform offered improved safety and TI when compared with certain currently available ADC platforms in preclinical models of AML. Differentiation between the CD33- and CD123-targeted ADCs was observed in safety studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. The CD33-targeted ADC produced severe hematologic toxicity, whereas minimal hematologic toxicity was observed with the CD123-targeted ADC at the same doses and exposures. The improved toxicity profile of an ADC targeting CD123 over CD33 was consistent with the more restricted expression of CD123 in normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: We optimized all components of ADC design (i.e., leukemia antigen, antibody, and linker-payload) to develop an ADC that has the potential to translate into an effective new therapy against AML.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Han, Yoon-Chi', 'Kahler, Jennifer', 'Piche-Nicholas, Nicole', 'Hu, Wenyue', 'Thibault, Stephane', 'Jiang, Fan', 'Leal, Mauricio', 'Katragadda, Madan', 'Maderna, Andreas', 'Dushin, Russell', 'Prashad, Nadira', 'Charati, Manoj B', 'Clark, Tracey', 'Tumey, L Nathan', 'Tan, Xingzhi', 'Giannakou, Andreas', 'Rosfjord, Edward', 'Gerber, Hans-Peter', 'Tchistiakova, Lioudmila', 'Loganzo, Frank', ""O'Donnell, Christopher J"", 'Sapra, Puja']","['Han YC', 'Kahler J', 'Piche-Nicholas N', 'Hu W', 'Thibault S', 'Jiang F', 'Leal M', 'Katragadda M', 'Maderna A', 'Dushin R', 'Prashad N', 'Charati MB', 'Clark T', 'Tumey LN', 'Tan X', 'Giannakou A', 'Rosfjord E', 'Gerber HP', 'Tchistiakova L', 'Loganzo F', ""O'Donnell CJ"", 'Sapra P']","['Pfizer Inc., Oncology Research & Development, Pearl River, New York.

The mechanism by which mitochondrial metabolism regulates mROS levels to support cancer cells is not fully understood. To address this, we conducted a metabolism-focused CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen and uncovered that loss of genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex I was deleterious in the presence of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-vitamin E (MVE). Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in combination with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, MVE or MitoTEMPO, induced a robust integrated stress response (ISR) and markedly diminished cell survival and proliferation in vitro. This was not observed following inhibition of mitochondrial complex III. Administration of MitoTEMPO in combination with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor phenformin decreased the leukemic burden in a mouse model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, mitochondrial complex I is a dominant metabolic determinant of mROS-dependent cellular fitness.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

High XPO1 expression (XPO1(high)) showed significant adverse prognostic impact in 544 studied DLBCL patients, especially in those with BCL2 overexpression. Therapeutic study in 30 DLBCL cell lines with various molecular and genetic background found robust cytotoxicity of selinexor, especially in cells with BCL2-rearranged (BCL2-R(+)) DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 double-hit (HGBCL-DH). However, expression of mutant (Mut) p53 significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of selinexor in overall cell lines and the BCL2-R and HGBCL-DH subsets, consistent with the favorable impact of XPO1(high) observed in Mut-p53-expressing patients. The therapeutic effect of selinexor in HGBCL-DH cells was significantly enhanced when combined with a BET inhibitor INCB057643, overcoming the drug resistance in Mut-p53-expressing cells. Collectively, these data suggest that XPO1 worsens the survival of DLBCL patients with unfavorable prognostic factors such as BCL2 overexpression and double-hit, in line with the higher efficacy of selinexor demonstrated in BCL2-R(+) DLBCL and HGBCL-DH cell lines. Expression of Mut-p53 confers resistance to selinexor treatment, which can be overcome by combined INCB057643 treatment in HGBCL-DH cells.

Among diverse population types, Caucasian populations are much more prone to this malignancy in comparison to darker skin populations due to the lack of skin pigmentation. Skin cancer is divided into malignant and non-melanoma skin cancer, which is further categorized as basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, chemical carcinogen (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, tar, etc.), and viruses (herpes virus, human papillomavirus, and human T-cell leukemia virus type-1) are major contributing factors to skin cancer. There are distinct pathways available through which skin cancer develops, such as the JAK-STAT pathway, Akt pathway, MAPKs signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, to name a few. Currently, several targeted treatments are available, such as monoclonal antibodies, which have dramatically changed the line of treatment of this disease but possess major therapeutic limitations. Thus, many phytochemicals have been evaluated either alone or in combination with the existing synthetic drugs to overcome their limitations and have been found to play a promising role in the prevention and treatment. In this review, a complete overview of skin cancer, starting from the signaling pathways involved, newer developed drugs with their targets and limitations, along with the emerging role of natural products alone or in combination as potent anticancer agents and their molecular mechanism involved has been discussed. Apart from this, various nano-cargos have also been mentioned here, which can play a significant role in the management and treatment of different types of skin cancer.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Iqubal, Mohammad Kashif', 'Chaudhuri, Aiswarya', 'Iqubal, Ashif', 'Saleem, Sadaf', 'Gupta, Madan Mohan', 'Ahuja, Alka', 'Ali, Javed', 'Baboota, Sanjula']","['Iqubal MK', 'Chaudhuri A', 'Iqubal A', 'Saleem S', 'Gupta MM', 'Ahuja A', 'Ali J', 'Baboota S']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi-110062, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi-110062, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi -110062, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi-110062, India.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medical Science, The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago, West Indies.', 'College of Pharmacy, National University of Science and Technology, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi-110062, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi-110062, India.']",['eng'],['3/2/2/45/2018/Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) SRF'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,['0 (Lipids)'],IM,"['*Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Signal Transduction', '*Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,,2020/11/06 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2020/11/05 05:35'],"['2020/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/05 05:35 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-111193 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867327666201104151752 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2021;28(39):8003-8035. doi: 10.2174/0929867327666201104151752.,8003-8035,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Melanoma', 'Wnt signaling pathway', 'hedgehog pathway inhibitors', 'lipid-nanocargos.', 'monoclonal antibody', 'phytotherapeutics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the binding pose is known from X-ray crystallography, the different steps leading to the formation of the complex are not well understood. The results from extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that imatinib can primarily exit the known crystallographic binding pose through the cleft of the binding site or by sliding under the alphaC helix. Once displaced from the crystallographic binding pose, imatinib becomes trapped in intermediate states. These intermediates are characterized by a high diversity of ligand orientations and conformations, and relaxation timescales within this region may exceed 3-4 ms.

We showed that AML patient blasts consistently expressed the PVRIG ligand (poliovirus receptor-related 2, PVRL2). Furthermore, PVRIG blockade significantly enhanced NK cell killing of PVRL2+, poliovirus receptor (PVR)lo AML cell lines, and significantly increased NK cell activation and degranulation in the context of patient primary AML blasts. However, in AML patient bone marrow, NK cell PVRIG expression levels were not increased. To understand how PVRIG blockade might potentially be exploited therapeutically, we investigated the biology of PVRIG and revealed that NK cell activation resulted in reduced PVRIG expression on the cell surface. This occurred whether NK cells were activated by tumour cell recognition, cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12) or activating receptor stimulation (CD16 and NKp46). PVRIG was present at higher levels in the cytoplasm than on the cell surface, particularly on CD56bright NK cells, which further increased cytoplasmic PVRIG levels following IL-2 and IL-12 activation.

The aim of the study was to review the available literature data on patients with CLL, with particular regard to the pathogenesis of the disease and the impact of humoral immunity deficiency on the clinical and therapeutic approach. A systematic literature review was carried out by two independent authors who searched PubMed databases for studies published up to January 2020. Additionally, Google Scholar was used to evaluate search results and support manual research. The search resulted in 240 articles eligible for analysis. After all criteria and filters were applied, 22 studies were finally applied to the analysis. The data analysis showed that the clinical heterogeneity of CLL patients correlates with the diversity of molecular abnormalities determining the clinical picture of the disease, the analysis of which enables setting therapeutic targets.

We find that mice lacking two aldehyde detoxifying enzymes, mitochondrial ALDH2 and cytoplasmic ADH5, have greatly shortened lifespans and develop leukemia. Hematopoiesis is disrupted profoundly, with a reduction of hematopoietic stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors causing a severely depleted acquired immune system. We show that formaldehyde is a common substrate of ALDH2 and ADH5 and establish methods to quantify elevated blood formaldehyde and formaldehyde-DNA adducts in tissues. Bone-marrow-derived progenitors actively engage DNA repair but also imprint a formaldehyde-driven mutation signature similar to aging-associated human cancer mutation signatures. Furthermore, we identify analogous genetic defects in children causing a previously uncharacterized inherited bone marrow failure and pre-leukemic syndrome. Endogenous formaldehyde clearance alone is therefore critical for hematopoiesis and in limiting mutagenesis in somatic tissues.","['Copyright (c) 2020 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

Progress toward understanding the mechanistic basis for therapy resistance in LSCs has been hampered by difficulties in isolating cell fractions that enrich for the entire heterogeneous population of LSCs within individual AML samples. We previously reported that CD200 gene expression is upregulated in LSC-containing AML fractions. Here, we show that CD200 is present on a greater proportion of CD45dim blasts compared with more differentiated CD45high cells in AML patient samples. In 75% (49 of 65) of AML cases we examined, CD200 was expressed on >/=10% of CD45dim blasts; of these, CD200 identified LSCs within the blast population in 9 of 10 (90%) samples tested in xenotransplantation assays. CD200+ LSCs could be isolated from CD200+ normal HSCs with the use of additional markers. Notably, CD200 expression captured both CD34- and CD34+ LSCs within individual AML samples. Analysis of highly purified CD200+ LSC-containing fractions from NPM1-mutated AMLs, which are commonly CD34-, exhibited an enrichment of primitive gene expression signatures compared with unfractionated cells. Overall, our findings support CD200 as a novel LSC marker that is able to capture the entire LSC compartment from AML patient samples, including those with NPM1 mutation.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ho, Jenny M', 'Dobson, Stephanie M', 'Voisin, Veronique', 'McLeod, Jessica', 'Kennedy, James A', 'Mitchell, Amanda', 'Jin, Liqing', 'Eppert, Kolja', 'Bader, Gary', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Dick, John E', 'Wang, Jean C Y']","['Ho JM', 'Dobson SM', 'Voisin V', 'McLeod J', 'Kennedy JA', 'Mitchell A', 'Jin L', 'Eppert K', 'Bader G', 'Minden MD', 'Dick JE', 'Wang JCY']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomedical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; and.', 'Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomedical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['RN380110-409786/Canadian Institutes for Health Research'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Nucleophosmin']",PMC7656934,,2020/11/05 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/11/04 17:12'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 17:12 [entrez]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31935-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001802 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Nov 10;4(21):5402-5413. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001802.,5402-5413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We comprehensively analyzed the fusion transcript landscape in 572 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 630 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients by whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS). Totally, 274 fusion events (131 unique fusions) were identified in 210/572 AML patients (37%). In 16/630 MDS patients, 16 fusion events (15 unique fusions) were detected (3%). In AML, 141 cases comprised entity-defining rearrangements (51% of all detected fusions) and 21 (8%) additional well-known fusions, all detected by WTS (control group). In MDS, only 1 fusion was described previously (NRIP1-MECOM, n = 2). Interestingly, a high number of so-far unreported fusions were found (41% [112/274] in AML, 88% [14/16] in MDS), all validated by cytogenetic and/or whole genome sequencing data. With 1 exception (CTDSP1-CFLAR, n = 2), all novel fusions were observed in 1 patient each. In AML, cases with novel fusions showed concomitantly a high frequency of TP53 mutations (67%) and of a complex karyotype (71%), which was also observed in MDS, but less pronounced (TP53, 26%; complex karyotype, 21%). A functional annotation of genes involved in novel fusions revealed many functional relevant genes (eg, transcription factors; n = 28 in AML, n = 2 in MDS) or enzymes (n = 42 in AML, n = 9 in MDS). Taken together, new genomic alterations leading to fusion transcripts were much more common in AML than in MDS.

Among patients with ALL, the initial complete remission (CR) rate was 85.5%. Twelve-month duration of response (DOR), event-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rates were 60.9%, 52.4%, and 77.2%, respectively. Among adults with NHL, the best overall response rate was 61.8%, including an initial CR rate of 39.5%. Six-month DOR, progression-free survival, and OS rates were 55.3%, 38.7%, and 70.7%, respectively. Grade >/=3 cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity were reported in 11.6% and 7.5% of all patients, respectively. Similar outcomes were observed in patients with in-specification and out-of-specification products as a result of viability <80% (range, 61% to 79%). This first report of tisagenlecleucel in the real-world setting demonstrates outcomes with similar efficacy and improved safety compared with those seen in the pivotal trials.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Pasquini, Marcelo C', 'Hu, Zhen-Huan', 'Curran, Kevin', 'Laetsch, Theodore', 'Locke, Frederick', 'Rouce, Rayne', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Phillips, Christine L', 'Keating, Amy', 'Frigault, Matthew J', 'Salzberg, Dana', 'Jaglowski, Samantha', 'Sasine, Joshua P', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Ghosh, Monalisa', 'Landsburg, Daniel', 'Margossian, Steven', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Kamdar, Manali K', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Nikiforow, Sarah', 'Turtle, Cameron', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Steinert, Patricia', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Moskop, Amy', 'Pacaud, Lida', 'Yi, Lan', 'Chawla, Raghav', 'Bleickardt, Eric', 'Grupp, Stephan']","['Pasquini MC', 'Hu ZH', 'Curran K', 'Laetsch T', 'Locke F', 'Rouce R', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Phillips CL', 'Keating A', 'Frigault MJ', 'Salzberg D', 'Jaglowski S', 'Sasine JP', 'Rosenthal J', 'Ghosh M', 'Landsburg D', 'Margossian S', 'Martin PL', 'Kamdar MK', 'Hematti P', 'Nikiforow S', 'Turtle C', 'Perales MA', 'Steinert P', 'Horowitz MM', 'Moskop A', 'Pacaud L', 'Yi L', 'Chawla R', 'Bleickardt E', 'Grupp S']","['Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', ""Cancer Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles/Pediatrics Department, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', 'Cellular Therapy Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', ""Pediatric Hematologic Oncology, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ."", 'Bone and Marrow Transplant Program, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", 'Pediatrics Department, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis, Hamden, CT;

However, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics, neutropenic fever (NF) and hospital readmissions continue to pose as the most important limitations in the outpatient setting. It is possible that the febrile episodes may have a non-infectious etiology, and engraftment syndrome could play a more significant role. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of both G-CSF withdrawal and the addition of primary prophylaxis with corticosteroids after ASCT. METHODS: Between January 2002 and August 2018, 111 MM patients conditioned with melphalan were managed at-home beginning +1 day after ASCT. Three groups were established: Group A (n = 33) received standard G-CSF post-ASCT; group B (n = 32) avoided G-CSF post-ASCT; group C (n = 46) avoided G-CSF yet added corticosteroid prophylaxis post-ASCT. RESULTS: The incidence of NF among the groups was reduced (64%, 44%, and 24%; P<0.001), with a non-significant decrease in hospital readmissions as well (12%, 6%, and 2%; P = 0.07). The most important variables identified for NF were: HCT-CI >2 (OR 6.1; P = 0.002) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.1; P<0.001); and for hospital readmission: age >/=60 years (OR 14.6; P = 0.04) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.07; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroid prophylaxis post ASCT minimize the incidence of NF in MM patients undergoing at-home ASCT. This approach should be explored in a prospective randomized clinical trial.",,"['Rodriguez-Lobato, Luis-Gerardo', 'Martinez-Roca, Alexandra', 'Castano-Diez, Sandra', 'Palomino-Mosquera, Alicia',

The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the cascade and the behind mechanisms, however, are still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the expression of miR-650, a well-recognized oncogenic miRNA in GC samples and to analyze the associations between this miRNA and HP infection, and the molecular mechanism. Following miRNA- and mRNA-based microarray analyses, miR-650, pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1), and LATS2 were filtered as targets. After that, function assays were implemented to assess their function in GC cells. miR-650 was upregulated in HP+ tissues and cells, and inhibition of miR-650 attenuated cell proliferation, invasion, migration, yet enhanced apoptosis. PBX1 was overexpressed in HP+ tissues and cells and promoted miR-650 transcription. Overexpression of PBX1 abrogated the effect of the miR-650 inhibitor on GC cells. miR-650 targeted LATS2, and LATS2 was poorly expressed in HP+ tissues and cell lines. Simultaneous knockdown of miR-650 and LATS2 reduced GC cell apoptosis.

Exosomes are critical mediators of intercellular communication. However, the role of exosomal circ-FBXW7 in the CRC oxaliplatin resistance remains unknown. Cell viability, apoptosis, motility, and drug efflux were measured by the cell counting kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, transwell assay, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry, respectively. The expression of circ-FBXW7 and microRNA (miR)-18b-5p was detected using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was used to determine multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), CD9, CD63, Caspase3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. Exosomes were isolated and captured using the ultracentrifugation method and transmission electron microscopy. The interaction between circ-FBXW7 and miR-18b-5p was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. In vivo experiments were conducted using the murine xenograft model. Our results showed that circ-FBXW7 was decreased in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC patients and cells. circ-FBXW7 was secreted by circ-FBXW7-transfected FHC cells and could be transferred to resistant CRC cells through the exosome secretion. Subsequently, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated exosomal circ-FBXW7 led resistant cells sensitive to oxaliplatin, increased the oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis, inhibited oxaliplatin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and suppressed oxaliplatin efflux. miR-18b-5p was increased in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC patients and cells and was confirmed to be a target of circ-FBXW7. Immediately, the rescue assay showed exosome-mediated transfer of circ-FBXW7 enhanced oxaliplatin sensitivity by binding to miR-18b-5p in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS: A case-controlled retrospective comparison of the craniofacial growth in 25 HSCT children and 25 matched-paired controls was conducted. Craniofacial growth was quantitatively assessed by linear and angular measurements in panoramic radiographic images using ImageJ . Stature growth and body weight were obtained through physical examination. Cancer diagnosis, myeloablative conditioning, and HSCT were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: Patients aged 12.2 years (+/-3.8; 16 male, 9 female). Radiographic images were obtained on an average of 2.43 (+/-2.0) years after HSCT. The main malignant diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (56%), followed by acute myeloid leukemia (36%) and myelodysplastic syndromes (8%). Total body irradiation was associated with chemotherapy at 80%. Mean age at transplantation was 10 (+/-4.7) years. HSCT survivors showed reduced a vertical growth of the mandibular ramus (p=0.003). This persisted among individuals below 12 years of age (p=0.017). The HSCT group showed delayed dental eruption, though there was no statistically significant difference (p=0.3668). The HSCT group showed stature deficit, increased weight, and body mass index (Z-score stature: -0.28; Z-score weight: 0.38, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HSCT has decreased vertical craniofacial growth compared to their matched controls. There might be an association between reduced craniofacial vertical growth and reduced estature growth.

The BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins interacts with the exposed hydrophobic groove of their anti-apoptotic counterparts. Through their design and development, BH3 mimetics that target the hydrophobic groove of specific anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have the potential to become anticancer drugs. We have developed a novel computational method for designing sequences with BH3 domain features that can bind specifically to anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 or Bcl-XL. In this method, we retained the four highly conserved hydrophobic and aspartic residues of wild-type BH3 sequences and randomly substituted all other positions to generate a large number of BH3-like sequences. We modeled 20000 complex structures with Mcl-1 or Bcl-XL using the BH3-like sequences derived from five wild-type pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides. Peptide-protein interaction energies calculated from these models for each set of BH3-like sequences resulted in negatively skewed extreme value distributions. The selected BH3-like sequences from the extreme negative tail regions have highly favorable interaction energies with Mcl-1 or Bcl-XL. They are enriched in acidic and basic residues when they bind to Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, respectively. With the charged residues often away from the binding interface, the overall electric field generated by the charged residues results in strong long-range electrostatic interaction energies between the peptide and the protein giving rise to high specificity. Cell viability studies of representative BH3-like peptides further validated the predicted specificity. This study has revealed the importance of non-hot spot residues in BH3-mimetic peptides in providing specificity to a particular anti-apoptotic protein.",,"['Reddy, C Narendra', 'Manzar, Nishat', 'Ateeq, Bushra', 'Sankararamakrishnan, Ramasubbu']","['Reddy CN', 'Manzar N', 'Ateeq B', 'Sankararamakrishnan R']",,['eng'],['IA/I(S)/12/2/500635/Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptidomimetics)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptidomimetics/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Substrate Specificity', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2020/11/05 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/11/04 08:41'],"['2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/04 08:41 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00661 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2020 Nov 17;59(45):4379-4394. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00661.

However, limited population-based data are available on cancer risk among patients with IPF. Herein, we investigated whether IPF is associated with an increased risk for cancer incidence from a nationwide database in South Korea. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, patients with IPF were enrolled from 2009 to 2014, and matched controls were randomly selected at a control-to-case ratio of 3:1. In both groups, individuals diagnosed with any malignancy before the index date were excluded. The incidence rates of cancer were measured as the number of events per 1000 person-years. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the cancer incidence risk. RESULTS: This study included 25 241 patients with IPF and 75 723 matched controls. The overall cancer incidence in patients with IPF was 29.0 cases per 1000 person-years, and it was significantly higher in the IPF group than in the non-IPF group (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.96-2.16). Lung cancer showed the highest HR (5.89; 95% CI, 5.40-6.42), followed by lymphoma, skin, uterine cervical, multiple myeloma, thyroid, leukaemia, pancreatic, liver and prostate cancer. Moreover, adjustment for the effects of smoking and other cancer-associated covariates had little effect on the HR of overall and specific cancers.

This approval was based on data from the ongoing multicenter, open-label single-arm trial TRITON2. The primary endpoint, confirmed objective response rate, in the 62 patients who met the above criteria, was 44% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31%-57%). The median duration of response was not estimable (95% CI: 6.4 to not estimable). Fifty-six percent of patients had a response duration of >6 months and 15% >12 months. The safety profile of rucaparib was generally consistent with that of the class of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme inhibitors and other trials of rucaparib in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Deaths due to adverse events (AEs) occurred in 1.7% of patients, and 8% discontinued rucaparib because of an AE. Grade 3-4 AEs occurred in 59% of patients. No patients with prostate cancer developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. The trial TRITON3 in patients with mCRPC is ongoing and is planned to verify the clinical benefit of rucaparib in mCRPC. This article summarizes the FDA thought process and data supporting this accelerated approval. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The accelerated approval of rucaparib for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane represents the first approved therapy for this selected patient population. This approval was based on a single-arm trial demonstrating a confirmed objective response rate greater than that of available therapy with a favorable duration of response and an acceptable toxicity profile. The ongoing trial TRITON3 is verifying the clinical benefit of this drug.","['Published 2020.

Epigenetic variability across human populations is associated with different genetic backgrounds, as well as variable lifestyles and environmental exposures, each of which should be investigated. To identify potential non-invasive biomarkers of sporadic breast cancer in the Uruguayan population, we studied genome-wide DNA methylation using Illumina methylation arrays in leukocytes of 22 women with sporadic breast cancer and 10 healthy women in a case-control study. We described a panel of 38 differentially methylated CpG positions that was able to cluster breast cancer patients (BCP) and controls, and that also recapitulated methylation differences in 12 primary breast tumors and their matched normal breast tissue. Moving forward, we simplified the detection method to improve its applicability in a clinical setting and used an independent well-characterized cohort of 80 leukocyte DNA samples from BCP and 80 healthy controls to validate methylation results at specific cancer-related genes. Our investigations identified methylation at CYFIP1 as a novel epigenetic biomarker candidate for sporadic breast cancer in the Uruguayan population.

Since the role of ORMDL1 in cancers remained unclear, the main purpose of our study was to explore the expression patterns and prognostic values of ORMDL1 in different tumors, especially in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and thymoma (THYM). Bioinformatics tools including GEPIA, CCLE, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, and TIMER databases were used. As a result, the expression levels of ORMDL1 in tumor tissues and normal tissues varied in different cancers, especially significantly upregulated in CHOL, DLBCL, LAML, and THYM. Moreover, ORMDL1 mRNA was also highly expressed in cell lines of DLBCL and LAML. Further studies showed that ORMDL1 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in DLBCL, but not significant in CHOL, LAML, and THYM. Consistently, there were genetic alterations of ORMDL1 in DLBCL, and patients with genetic alterations indicated worse survival. Coexpressed genes and related biological events with ORMDL1 in DLBCL were found via LinkedOmics, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The relationship between ORMDL1 and cancer immune cells was investigated, and ORMDL1 expression was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of B cells. In conclusion, ORMDL1 is suggested to be a tumorigenic factor and considered as the potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in DLBCL.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Tengjiao Zhu et al.'],"['Zhu, Tengjiao', 'Chen, Yingtong', 'Min, Shuyuan', 'Li, Fang', 'Tian, Yun']","['Zhu T', 'Chen Y', 'Min S', 'Li F', 'Tian Y']","['Peking University Third Hospital, 49 Huayuan North Road, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Peking University Third Hospital, 49 Huayuan North Road, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Peking University Third Hospital, 49 Huayuan North Road, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Peking University Third Hospital, 49 Huayuan North Road, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Peking University Third Hospital, 49 Huayuan North Road, Beijing 100191, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (ORMDL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thymoma/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/mortality']",PMC7596526,['All authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],2020/11/05 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/11/04 05:47'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 05:47 [entrez]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/5178397 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Oct 21;2020:5178397. doi: 10.1155/2020/5178397. eCollection 2020.,5178397,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0228-1814', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2310-6054']",20201021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 axis plays an important role in the protective effect of the bone marrow microenvironment (BME) on CML cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Wogonin could increase the sensitivity of CML cells to IM when they were co-cultured with BME and explore its underlying mechanism. Methods: A model of CML cells co-cultured with BMSCs was applied in vitro. Flow cytometric, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR assays were used to explore the protective effects of BME on CML cells. Results: The results showed that Wogonin could reverse the resistance of CML cells to IM under co-culture conditions by inhibiting Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) secretion in the BME, preventing the translocation of Smad4 into nucleus and subsequently reducing the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in CML cells. Moreover, the reverse effect of Wogonin was demonstrated by inhibiting the activation of CXCL12-CXCR4/7 axis via restraining the TGF-beta/Smad4/Id3 pathway in vitro. In vivo studies also showed that Wogonin decreased the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in mice bone marrow with low systemic toxicity, and the mechanism was consistent with the in vitro study. Conclusions: Wogonin increases the sensitivity of CML cells to IM in BME by controlling the TGF-beta/Smad4/Id3 pathway and decreasing the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7. These results co-supported the point that Wogonin could be a potential candidate of reversal agents on treatment of IM-resistant CML.",['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Methods: We searched for related studies including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Database as of July 20, 2020 to conduct this meta-analysis. To improve the accuracy, the quality assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Study 2 (QUADAS-2) was used. We also applied random effects models to summarize sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and area under the curve (AUC) to measure diagnostic values, and subgroup analysis used to discover potential sources of heterogeneity. Results: We finally collected 32 studies from 15 articles that included a total of 2053 MM patients and 1118 healthy controls in this meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR and AUC were 0.81, 0.85, 5.5, 0.22, 25 and 0.90, respectively. Subgroup analysis shows that the down-regulation of microRNA clusters with larger samples size of plasma type could carry out a better diagnostic accuracy of MM patients. In addition, publication bias was not found. Conclusions: Circulating miRNA could be a potential non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis of MM. However, multi-center, more rigorous, and larger-scale studies are needed to verify our conclusions.",['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Gao, Shuai-Shuai', 'Wang, Yan-Jun', 'Zhang, Guo-Xun', 'Zhang, Wen-Ting']","['Gao SS', 'Wang YJ', 'Zhang GX', 'Zhang WT']","[""Department of Traumatology and Orthopedic Surgery, Xi'an Daxing Hospital, Shaanxi, China."", 'International Doctoral School, University of Seville, Spain.', ""Department of Traumatology and Orthopedic Surgery, Xi'an Daxing Hospital, Shaanxi, China."", 'International Doctoral School, University of Seville, Spain.', 'International Doctoral School, University of Seville, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Bone Oncol,Journal of bone oncology,101610292,,,,PMC7596263,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",2020/11/05 06:00,2020/11/05 06:01,['2020/11/04 05:45'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100327 [doi]', 'S2212-1374(20)30082-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Bone Oncol. 2020 Oct 21;25:100327. doi: 10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100327. eCollection 2020 Dec.,100327,,20201021,['NOTNLM'],"['AUC, Area under the curve', 'CI, confidence interval', 'DOR, Diagnostic odds ratio', 'Diagnosis', 'MGUS, Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance', 'MM, Multiple myeloma', 'Meta-analysis', 'MicroRNAs', 'Multiple myeloma', 'NLR, Negative likelihood ratio', 'PCL, Plasma cell leukemia', 'PLR, Positive likelihood ratio', 'QUADAS-2, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Study 2', 'SE, Sensitivity', 'SP, Specificity', 'microRNA, miRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TB guidelines recommend that LTBI screening and treatments target high-risk patients. Malignancies are not universally considered a high-risk factor for active TB. This study aimed to determine the degrees to which active TB risk was associated with various cancers in a Korean population. Methods: This study involved patients aged >/=20 years who were diagnosed with cancer at Ulsan University Hospital (UUH) from January 2000 to December 2014 and individuals who visited UUH for health screening and were age- and sex-matched randomly with cases in a 1:2 ratio. Using retrospective cohort study, the development of bacteriologically confirmed TB (BCTB) within 3 years after enrollment was investigated. The relative risks of BCTB were estimated using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and a Poisson regression analysis. Results: During the study period, 380 of 34,783 cancer patients and 79 of 69,566 control subjects developed BCTB, yielding respective incidence rates of 535 and 37/100,000 person-years, respectively. In all cancer cases, the IRR of BCTB was 14.30, and especially high rates were associated with the following cancers: esophageal cancer (74.72), multiple myeloma (70.76), lung cancer (50.35), pancreatic cancer (46.04), leukemia (40.45), head and neck cancer (24.60), and lymphoma (22.67). Conclusions: The incidence of active TB was higher in cancer patients than in control subjects. In particular, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, hematologic malignancy and head and neck cancer were identified as high-risk factors for active TB, as indicated by IRRs of 20-75. These findings suggest that patients with high-risk cancers should be targeted for LTBI screening and treatment.",['2020 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

To revert type 1 diabetes, the suppression of the autoimmune attack should be combined with a beta-cell replacement strategy. It has been previously demonstrated that liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, restores beta-cell mass in type 1 diabetes, via alpha-cell transdifferentiation and neogenesis. We report here that treatment with liraglutide does not prevent type 1 diabetes in the spontaneous non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, but it tends to reduce leukocytic islet infiltration. However, in combination with an immunotherapy based on tolerogenic liposomes, it is effective in ameliorating hyperglycaemia in diabetic NOD mice. Importantly, liraglutide is not detrimental for the tolerogenic effect that liposomes exert on dendritic cells from patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of membrane expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation, immunoregulation and activation. Moreover, the in vivo effect of the combined therapy was tested in mice humanised with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with type 1 diabetes, showing no adverse effects in leukocyte subsets.

With MCL1-specific inhibitors currently in clinical trials, it is imperative that we understand the roles that MCL1 plays in cells, especially when targeting the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) pocket, the central region of MCL1 that mediates apoptotic regulation. Here, we establish that MCL1 has a direct role in controlling p73 transcriptional activity, which modulates target genes associated with DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. This interaction is mediated through the reverse BH3 (rBH3) motif in the p73 tetramerization domain, which restricts p73 assembly on DNA. Here, we provide a novel mechanism for protein-level regulation of p73 transcriptional activity by MCL1, while also framing a foundation for studying MCL1 inhibitors in combination with platinum-based chemotherapeutics.

In this study, Jurkat cell growth inhibitory extracts of R. japonicus roots were subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation, resulting in the isolation of three naphthalene derivatives (3-5) along with one anthraquinone (6) and two phenolic compounds (1 and 2). Among these compounds, 2-methoxystypandrone (5) exhibited potent anti-proliferative effects on Jurkat cells. Analysis by flow cytometry confirmed that 2-methoxystypandrone (5) could significantly reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and promote increased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a strong mitochondrial depolarization effect. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was also performed, and the results revealed that the accumulation of ROS was caused by reduced mRNA expression levels of heme oxygenase (HO-1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, 2-methoxystypandrone (5) triggered strong apoptosis that was mediated by the arrest of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, 2-methoxystypandrone (5) downregulated p-IkappaB-alpha, p-NF-kappaB p65, Bcl2, and Bcl-xl and upregulated BAX proteins. Taken together, these findings revealed that 2-methoxystypandrone (5) isolated from RJH could potentially serve as an early lead compound for leukemia treatment involving intracellular signaling by increasing mitochondrial ROS and exerting anti-proliferative effects.",,"['Qiu, Yinda', 'Li, Aoding', 'Lee, Jina', 'Lee, Jeong Eun', 'Lee, Eun-Woo', 'Cho, Namki', 'Yoo, Hee Min']","['Qiu Y', 'Li A', 'Lee J', 'Lee JE', 'Lee EW', 'Cho N', 'Yoo HM']","['College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Republic of Korea.', 'Biometrology Group, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic Regulation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Functional Genomics, KRIBB School of Bioscience, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic Regulation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 61186, Republic of Korea.', 'Biometrology Group, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,"['0 (2-Methoxystypandrone)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Republic of Korea', 'Rumex/*chemistry', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2020/11/05 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/11/04 05:37'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/04 05:37 [entrez]']","['jmb.2007.07018 [pii]', '10.4014/jmb.2007.07018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2020 Dec 28;30(12):1885-1895. doi: 10.4014/jmb.2007.07018.,1885-1895,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat cells', 'Rumex japonicus Houtt', 'apoptosis', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sindbis virus (SINV) is the prototype alphavirus and preferentially infects neurons in rodents to induce an encephalomyelitis similar to the human disease. Using a mouse model of SINV infection of the nervous system, many of the immune processes involved in recovery from viral encephalomyelitis have been identified. Antibody specific to the SINV E2 glycoprotein plays an important role in recovery and is sufficient for noncytolytic suppression of virus replication in vivo and in vitro. To investigate the mechanism of anti-E2 antibody-mediated viral suppression, a reverse-phase protein array was used to broadly survey cellular signaling pathway activation following antibody treatment of SINV-infected differentiated AP-7 neuronal cells. Anti-E2 antibody induced rapid transient NF-kappaB and later sustained Y705 STAT3 phosphorylation, outlining an intracellular signaling cascade activated by antiviral antibody. Because NF-kappaB target genes include the STAT3-activating IL-6 family cytokines, expression of these messenger RNAS (mRNAs) was assessed. Expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine mRNA, but not other IL-6 family member mRNAs, was up-regulated by anti-E2 antibody. LIF induced STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation in infected differentiated AP-7 cells but did not inhibit virus replication. However, anti-E2 antibody localized the LIF receptor to areas of E2 expression on the infected cell surface, and LIF enhanced the antiviral effects of antibody. These findings identify activation of the NF-kappaB/LIF/STAT3 signaling cascade as involved in inducing antibody-mediated viral suppression and highlight the importance of nonneutralizing antibody functions in viral clearance from neurons.",,"['Yeh, Jane X', 'Schultz, Kimberly L W', 'Calvert, Valerie', 'Petricoin, Emanuel F', 'Griffin, Diane E']","['Yeh JX', 'Schultz KLW', 'Calvert V', 'Petricoin EF', 'Griffin DE']","['W.

New-onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) occurs frequently following allo-HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study endpoints were incidence and risk factors of PDTM. We studied 599 adult patients suffering from either acute myeloid leukemia n=220), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=79), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=22), myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (n=105), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=37), lymphoma/myeloma (n=116, or non-malignant disorders (e.g. bone marrow failure, hemoglobinopathies) (n=20) who underwent myeloablative (466; 77.8%) or non-myeloablative (131; 21.9%) allo-HSCT between 2006 and 2016. RESULTS: Altogether, 39 patients (6.5%) developed PTDM. In a competing-risk analysis, time to PTDM was associated with acute grade 2-4 graft-versus-host-disease (p=0.017). Further cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension (n=145; 24.2%), coronary artery disease (n=36, 6%), dyslipidemia (n=139; 23.3%), and stroke (n=12; 2%). CONCLUSION: After allo-HSCT, a significant number of patients developed PTDM and patients with acute graft-versus-host-disease were found to have a higher risk for PTDM. Long-term and continuous follow-up for diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors after HSCT is important in order to be able to provide timely and appropriate treatment.","['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Dalla Via, Vera', 'Halter, JOrg P', 'Gerull, Sabine', 'Arranto, Christian', 'Tichelli, AndrE', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Medinger, Michael', 'Cesana-Nigro, Nicole']","['Dalla Via V', 'Halter JP', 'Gerull S', 'Arranto C', 'Tichelli A', 'Heim D', 'Passweg JR', 'Medinger M', 'Cesana-Nigro N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland michael.medinger@usb.ch.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, Burgerspital Solothurn, Solothurn, Switzerland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Burgerspital Solothurn, Solothurn, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Adult', '*Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/etiology', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",PMC7811658,,2020/11/05 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/11/04 05:36'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 05:36 [entrez]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['34/6/3545 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.12197 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2020 Nov-Dec;34(6):3545-3549. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12197.,3545-3549,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'cardiovascular risk factors', 'diabetes', 'insulin therapy', 'long-term survivors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor state forms the epigenetic basis for myelomonocytic leukemia stemness and transformation by MLL-type oncoproteins. Previously, it was shown that the establishment of murine myelomonocytic MLL-ENL transformation, but not its maintenance, depends on the transcription factor C/EBPalpha, suggesting an epigenetic hit-and-run mechanism of MLL-driven oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that compound deletion of Cebpa/Cebpb almost entirely abrogated the growth and survival of MLL-ENL-transformed cells. Rare, slow-growing, and apoptosis-prone MLL-ENL-transformed escapees were recovered from compound Cebpa/Cebpb deletions. The escapees were uniformly characterized by high expression of the resident Cebpe gene, suggesting inferior functional compensation of C/EBPalpha/C/EBPbeta deficiency by C/EBPepsilon. Complementation was augmented by ectopic C/EBPbeta expression and downstream activation of IGF1 that enhanced growth. Cebpe gene inactivation was accomplished only in the presence of complementing C/EBPbeta, but not in its absence, confirming the Cebpe dependency of the Cebpa/Cebpb double knockouts. Our data show that MLL-transformed myeloid cells are dependent on C/EBPs during the initiation and maintenance of transformation.",['(c) 2020 Wesolowski et al.'],"['Wesolowski, Radoslaw', 'Kowenz-Leutz, Elisabeth', 'Zimmermann, Karin', 'Dorr, Dorothea', 'Hofstatter, Maria', 'Slany, Robert K', 'Mildner, Alexander', 'Leutz, Achim']","['Wesolowski R', 'Kowenz-Leutz E', 'Zimmermann K', 'Dorr D', 'Hofstatter M', 'Slany RK', 'Mildner A', 'Leutz A']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany aleutz@mdc-berlin.de.', 'Institute of Biology, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cebpe protein, mouse)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*deficiency/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*deficiency/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transfection']",PMC7652399,,2020/11/05 06:00,2021/09/15 06:00,['2020/11/04 05:36'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 05:36 [entrez]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['4/1/e202000709 [pii]', '10.26508/lsa.202000709 [doi]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2020 Nov 3;4(1). pii: 4/1/e202000709. doi: 10.26508/lsa.202000709.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive, analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Paediatric Oncology, Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Rawalpindi, Pakistan from January 2012 to January 2019. METHODOLOGY: Data of all newly registered cases of paediatric AML was analysed to see the association of nutritional status according to Z-score classification and treatment outcome. The outcome was divided into disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 206 cases, including 130 (63.1%) boys and 76 (36.9%) girls were evaluated. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.96 +/- 3.58 years. Pallor was the most common clinical feature in 172 (83.5%) followed by fever in 158 (76.7%) cases. AML M-2 was the most frequent French-American-British (FAB) subtype in 94 (45.6%) cases. Majority of the patients (n = 128, 62.1%) were well nourished; and 46 (22.3%) and 32 (15.5%) were moderately and severely malnourished, respectively. Disease-free survival (DFS) was 43.0%, 32.6% and 21.9% in well nourished, moderately malnourished and severely malnourished patients, respectively (p=0.022). Overall survival (OS) was 43.8%, 39.1% and 21.9% in well nourished, moderately malnourished and severely malnourished patients, respectively (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: Malnutrition adversely affects the treatment outcome in paediatric AML. It is significantly associated with increased treatment-related mortality, mainly due to infection and decreased disease-free and overall survival.

They might act as enhancer activity-related therapeutic targets in cancer. However, the underlying mechanism of epigenetic activation and their function in cancer initiation and progression remain largely unknown. RESULTS: We identify a set of lncRNAs as lnc-eRNAs according to the epigenetic signatures of enhancers. We show that these lnc-eRNAs are broadly activated in MLL-rearranged leukemia (MLL leukemia), an aggressive leukemia caused by a chromosomal translocation, through a mechanism by which the HOXA cluster initiates enhancer activity, and the epigenetic reader BRD4 cooperates with the coregulator MLL fusion oncoprotein to induce transcriptional activation. To demonstrate the functional roles of lnc-eRNAs, two newly identified lnc-eRNAs transcribed from the SEELA eRNA cluster (SEELA), SEELA1 and SEELA2, are chosen for further studies. The results show that SEELA mediated cis-activated transcription of the nearby oncogene Serine incorporate 2 (SERINC2) by directly binding to the K31 amino acid (aa) of histone H4. Chromatin-bound SEELA strengthens the interaction between chromatin and histone modifiers to promote histone recognition and oncogene transcription. Further studies show that the SEELA-SERINC2 axis regulated aspects of cancer metabolism, such as sphingolipid synthesis, to affect leukemia progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that lnc-eRNAs are epigenetically activated by cancer-initiating oncoproteins and uncovers a cis-activating mechanism of oncogene transcription control based on lnc-eRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation of enhancer activity, providing insights into the critical roles of lnc-eRNAs in cancer initiation and progression.",,"['Fang, Ke', 'Huang, Wei', 'Sun, Yu-Meng', 'Chen, Tian-Qi', 'Zeng, Zhan-Cheng', 'Yang, Qian-Qian', 'Pan, Qi', 'Han, Cai', 'Sun, Lin-Yu', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Wang, Wen-Tao', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Fang K', 'Huang W', 'Sun YM', 'Chen TQ', 'Zeng ZC', 'Yang QQ', 'Pan Q', 'Han C', 'Sun LY', 'Luo XQ', 'Wang WT', 'Chen YQ']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China. wangwt8@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China. lsscyq@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,"['0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (SERINC2 protein, human)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Sphingolipids', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC7607629,,2020/11/05 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2020/11/04 05:31'],"['2020/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13059-020-02186-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13059-020-02186-x [pii]']",epublish,Genome Biol. 2020 Nov 3;21(1):269. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-02186-x.,269,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5140-1993'],20201103,['NOTNLM'],"['*Enhancer activity', '*Histone H4', '*Histone recognition', '*Lnc-eRNA', '*MLL leukemia', '*SEELA', '*Sphingolipid metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OPTN (optineurin), a macroautophagy/autophagy (hereinafter referred to as autophagy) receptor, is found to play a pivotal role in selective autophagy, coupling autophagy with bone metabolism. However, its role in osteogenesis is still mysterious. Herein, we identified Optn as a critical molecule of cell fate decision for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whose expression decreased in aged mice. Aged mice revealed osteoporotic bone loss, elevated senescence of MSCs, decreased osteogenesis, and enhanced adipogenesis, as well as optn(-)(/ -) mice. Importantly, restoring Optn by transplanting wild-type MSCs to optn(-)(/ -) mice or infecting optn(-)(/ -) mice with Optn-containing lentivirus rescued bone loss. The introduction of a loss-of-function mutant of Optn(K193R) failed to reestablish a bone-fat balance. We further identified FABP3 (fatty acid binding protein 3, muscle and heart) as a novel selective autophagy substrate of OPTN. FABP3 promoted adipogenesis and inhibited osteogenesis of MSCs. Knockdown of FABP3 alleviated bone loss in optn(-)(/ -) mice and aged mice. Our study revealed that reduced OPTN expression during aging might lead to OP due to a lack of FABP3 degradation via selective autophagy. FABP3 accumulation impaired osteogenesis of MSCs, leading to the occurrence of OP. Thus, reactivating OPTN or inhibiting FABP3 would open a new avenue to treat senile OP.Abbreviations: ADIPOQ: adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing; ALPL: alkaline phosphatase, liver/bone/kidney; BGLAP/OC/osteocalcin: bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein; BFR/BS: bone formation rate/bone surface; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CDKN1A/p21: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; CDKN2A/p16: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; CDKN2B/p15: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B; CEBPA: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha; COL1A1: collagen, type I, alpha 1; Ct.

We investigated whether BLV infection affects host genes associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Next-generation sequencing of blood samples from five calves experimentally infected with BLV revealed the highest expression levels of seven MMR genes (EXO1, UNG, PCNA, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and PMS2) at the point of peak proviral loads (PVLs). Furthermore, MMR gene expression was only upregulated in cattle with higher PVLs. In particular, the expression levels of MSH2, MSH3, and UNG positively correlated with PVL in vivo. The expression levels of all seven MMR genes in pig kidney-15 cells and the levels of PMS2 and EXO1 in HeLa cells also increased tendencies after transient transfection with a BLV infectious clone. Moreover, MMR gene expression levels were significantly higher in BLV-expressing cell lines compared with those in the respective parental cell lines. Expression levels of MSH2 and EXO1 in BLV-infected cattle with lymphoma were significantly lower and higher, respectively, compared with those in infected cattle in vivo.

CAEBV has been primarily reported in East Asia and Latin America, suggesting a genetic predisposition in its pathogenesis. In most cases of CAEBV, EBV induces proliferation of its unusual host cells, T or natural killer (NK) cells. The clinical course of CAEBV is heterogeneous; some patients show an indolent course, remaining in a stable condition for years, whereas others show an aggressive course with a fatal outcome due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, multiple organ failure, or progression to leukemia/lymphoma. The pathogenesis of CAEBV is unclear and clinicopathological investigations suggest that it has aspects of both malignant neoplasm and immunodeficiency. Recent genetic analyses of both viral and host genomes in CAEBV patients have led to discoveries that are improving our understanding of the nature of this syndrome.

While anamnestic and cytogenetic criteria provide objective attribution to this subset, with clear unfavorable prognostic significance, the actual role of multi-lineage dysplasia (MLD) as assessed by morphology is debated. The aim of our work was to study MLD by a technique alternative to morphology, which is multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), in a large series of 302 AML patients intensively treated at our Center. The correlation with morphology we observed in the unselected analysis reiterated the capability of the MFC-based approach at highlighting dysplasia. MLD data, estimated through an immune-phenotypic score (IPS), provided no insight into prognosis when considered overall nor within well-defined genetic categories. Of interest, IPS-related dysplasia conveyed significant prognostic information when we focused on genetically undefined patients, triple-negative for NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA (TN-AML). In this context, the lack of dysplastic features (IPS_0) correlated with a significantly higher CR rate and longer survival compared to patients showing dysplasia in one or both (neutrophil and erythroid) cell lineages. The impact of IPS category maintained its validity after censoring at allogeneic HSCT and in a multivariate analysis including baseline and treatment-related covariates.

Recently, the incidence of ALV-J in broiler and layer chickens has significantly decreased. However, it has caused substantial damage to Chinese local chickens, resulting in immense challenges to their production performance and breeding safety. To systematically analyze the molecular characteristics and the epidemic trend of ALV-J in Chinese local chickens, 260 clinical samples were collected for the period of 2013-2018; 18 ALV-J local chicken isolates were identified by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and subgroup A-, B-, and J-specific multiplex PCR. The whole genomic sequences of 18 isolates were amplified with PCR and submitted to GenBank. Approximately, 55.5% (10/18) of the 18 isolates demonstrated a relatively high homology (92.3-95.4%) with 20 ALV-J early-isolated local strains (genome sequences obtained from GenBank) in gp85 genes clustering in a separated branch. The 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the 18 isolates showed a 195-210 and 16-28 base pair deletion in the redundant transmembrane region and in direct repeat 1, respectively; 55.5% (10/18) of the 18 isolates retained the 147 residue E element. The U3 gene of 61.1% (11/18) of the 18 isolates shared high identity (94.6-97.3%) with ALV-J early-isolated local strains. These results implied that the gp85 and U3 of ALV-J local chicken isolates have rapidly evolved and formed a unique local chicken branch. In addition, it was determined that the gene deletion in the 3'UTR region currently serves as a unique molecular characteristic of ALV-J in China. Hence, the obtained results built on the existing ALV-J molecular epidemiological data and further elucidated the genetic evolution trend of ALV-J in Chinese local chickens.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

All synthesized 6(7)-aminoquinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-dioxides 3-6 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity and hypoxia selectivity compared to the reference agent tirapazamine against breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231). The structure and position of the diamine residue considerably affects the antiproliferative properties of the quinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-dioxides. The introduction of a halogen atom at position 7 in the quinoxaline ring of 4a considerably increases the cytotoxicity of compounds 5a and 6a under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. However, the most hypoxia-selective derivatives were non-halogenated 7-aminosubstituted 3-phenylquinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-dioxides 3a-j. Of the 32 novel synthesized derivatives, approximately 20 of the 6(7)-amino-3-phenylquinoxaline-2-carbonitrile 1,4-dioxides demonstrated high antiproliferative potency against wild type leukemia cells K562 and drug-resistant subline K562/4 with the expression of p-glycoprotein (p-gp) compared to the reference agent doxorubicin, which exhibited one order of magnitude lower activity towards K562/4 cells than towards K562 cells. Lead compounds 5a and 3f inhibited HIF-1alpha expression and activity and induced apoptosis in hypoxic tumor cells, which was confirmed by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, 5a and 3f showed strong antiestrogenic potencies in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Thus, the described series of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides has high anticancer potential and good aqueous solubility. Therefore, these compounds are promising for further drug development of hypoxia-targeted anticancer agents.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This provides a rationale for the development of small molecule inhibitors that selectively target p110delta for patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here in this paper, we comprehensively evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of SHC014748M, an oral selective inhibitor of PI3Kdelta under Phase I clinical evaluation. Biochemical and cell-based assays were used to measure compound potency and selectivity in lymphoma cell lines as well as primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Scid mice were subcutaneously inoculated with the SU-DHL-6 cell line. SHC014748M was more selective for PI3Kdelta inhibition relative to other class I PI3K enzymes and showed in vitro activity in most of 23 B lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL cells. SHC014748M also inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, targets downstream of PI3Kdelta, in both lymphoma cells and primary CLL cells. In vivo study revealed that SHC014748M significantly reduced lymphoma cell growth in the treatment group compared with control mice. CCL4, CCL17, CCL22 and CXCL13 in patient serum decreased sharply after SHC014748M treatment.

We retrospectively reviewed records of children (age </= 18 years) who underwent MSD-HSCT for AML at our center from 2009 to 2019 to evaluate clinical outcome and its predictors using Cox proportional hazards model. There were 46 children (36 boys and 10 girls) with mean age 10.7 +/- 4.8 years. Indication for HSCT was relapsed AML in CR2 (n = 37), primary refractory (n = 3), or relapsed refractory disease (n = 3); high-risk (n = 1) or secondary (n = 2) AML in CR1. Five-year EFS and OS were 33.3 +/- 7.2% and 36.3 +/- 7.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, CR1 duration less than 12 months, presence of active disease at transplant, and use of bone marrow stem cell graft were associated with poorer EFS and OS. There was one (2.2%) TRM, while disease relapse occurred in 20/40 patients who underwent HSCT in remission. Though the 5-year EFS and OS were inferior to results reported from high-income countries, relapse (and not TRM) was the major cause of treatment failure. A well-sustained CR1, achievement of disease remission, and use of peripheral blood allograft seem imperative to a successful transplant.

An epidemiologic study conducted in Brazil reported a high incidence of IFD in haematologic patients, and invasive fusariosis was the leading IFD. A limitation of that study was that galactomannan was not available for at least half of the study period. In order to characterise the epidemiology and burden of IFD in three cohorts, HCT, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS), and acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study in four haematologic Brazilian centres. From August 2015 to July 2016, all patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML, MDS or ALL, and all HCT recipients receiving conditioning regimen were followed during the period of neutropenia following chemotherapy or the conditioning regimen. During a 1-year period, 192 patients were enrolled: 122 HCT recipients (71 allogeneic, 51 autologous), 46 with AML, and 24 with ALL. The global incidence of IFD was 13.0% (25 cases, 11 proven and 14 probable). Invasive aspergillosis (14 cases) was the leading IFD, followed by candidemia (6 cases) and fusariosis (3 cases).

METHODS: A pooled analysis of long-term follow-up data from 2 phase 2 studies that evaluated blinatumomab in heavily pretreated adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative, relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were included in the analysis. The median overall survival (OS) among all patients, regardless of response, was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5-8.5 months); the median follow-up time for OS was 36.0 months (range, 0.3-60.8 months). The median relapse-free survival (RFS) among patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) in the first 2 cycles (n = 123) was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.2-10.0 months); the median follow-up time for RFS was 35.0 months (range, 9.5-59.5 months). OS and RFS plateaued with 3-year rates of 17.7% and 23.4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence function of the time to relapse, with death not due to relapse considered a competing risk, for patients who achieved a CR/CRh within 2 cycles of treatment also plateaued with a 3-year relapse rate of 59.3%. For patients who achieved a CR/CRh with blinatumomab followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation while in continuous CR, the median OS was 18.1 months (95% CI, 10.3-30.0 months) with a 3-year survival rate of 37.2%. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that long-term survival is possible after blinatumomab therapy. LAY SUMMARY: Immuno-oncology therapies such as blinatumomab activate the patient's own immune system to kill cancer cells. This study combined follow-up data from 2 blinatumomab-related clinical trials to evaluate long-term survival in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at high risk for unfavorable outcomes. Among patients who achieved a deep response with blinatumomab, one-third lived 3 years or longer. These findings suggest that long-term survival is possible after treatment with blinatumomab.","['(c) 2020 Amgen GmbH.

While it is generally accepted that there exist several biological mechanisms that may define distinct schizophrenia subtypes, they have not been identified yet. We performed comprehensive gene expression analysis to search for molecular signals that differentiate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls and examined whether an identified signal was concentrated in a subgroup of the patients. METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing of 14 superior temporal gyrus (STG) samples of subjects with schizophrenia and 15 matched controls from the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) was performed. Differential expression and pathway enrichment analysis results were compared to an independent cohort. Replicability was tested on 6 additional independent datasets. RESULTS: The 2 STG cohorts showed high replicability. Pathway enrichment analysis of the down-regulated genes pointed to proteasome-related pathways. Meta-analysis of differential expression identified down-regulation of 12 of 39 proteasome subunit genes in schizophrenia. The signal of proteasome subunits down-regulation was replicated in 6 additional datasets (overall 8 cohorts with 267 schizophrenia and 266 control samples, from 5 brain regions). The signal was concentrated in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: We detected global down-regulation of proteasome subunits in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia. We hypothesize that the down-regulation of proteasome subunits leads to proteasome dysfunction that causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which has been recently detected in a subgroup of schizophrenia patients. Thus, down-regulation of proteasome subunits might define a biological subtype of schizophrenia.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

ARS was developed as an antimalarial drug and currently belongs to the established standard treatments of malaria as a combination therapy worldwide. In addition to the antimalarial bioactivity of ARS, anticancer activities have been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Like other natural products, ARS acts in a multi-specific manner also against hematological malignancies. The chemical structure of ARS is a sesquiterpene lactone, which contains an endoperoxide bridge essential for activity. The main mechanism of action of ARS and its derivatives (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, artemether) toward leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma cells comprises oxidative stress response, inhibition of proliferation, induction of various types of cell death as apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, and signal transducers, as NF-kappaB, MYC, amongst others. Therefore, new pharmaceutically active compounds, dimers, trimers, and hybrid molecules, could enhance the existing therapeutic alternatives in combating hematologic malignancies. Owing to the high potency and good tolerance without side effects of ARS-type drugs, combination therapies with standard chemotherapies could be applied in the future after further clinical trials in hematological malignancies.",,"['Mancuso, R I', 'Foglio, M A', 'Olalla Saad, S T']","['Mancuso RI', 'Foglio MA', 'Olalla Saad ST']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, HEMOCENTRO UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, HEMOCENTRO UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. sara@unicamp.br.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '9RMU91N5K2 (artemisinin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimalarials/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Artemisinins/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans']",,,2020/11/04 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/11/03 12:49'],"['2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/03 12:49 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-020-04170-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-020-04170-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2021 Jan;87(1):1-22. doi: 10.1007/s00280-020-04170-5.

Besides, the AML cell lines revealed distinct differences in (18)F-FDG uptake ranging from 4.1 to 11.0%. Moreover, the Pearson coefficient (0.363) suggests a moderate correlation between (18)F-FDG uptake and the IC50 values of ABT-737. Differentiation of the AML cell lines NB-4 and AML-193 with all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA) induced a significant increase in sensitivity towards ABT-737 along with a reduced uptake of (18)F-FDG. Therefore, (18)F-FDG uptake could be predictive on sensitivity to treatment with ABT-737.

A promising source are CD34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), since large numbers of cytotoxic NK cells can be generated. Effective boosting of NK cell function can be achieved by interleukin (IL)-15. However, its in vivo half-life is short and potent trans-presentation by IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha) is absent. Therefore, ImmunityBio developed IL-15 superagonist N-803, which combines IL-15 with an activating mutation, an IL-15Ralpha sushi domain for trans-presentation, and IgG1-Fc for increased half-life. Here, we investigated whether and how N-803 improves HPC-NK cell functionality in leukemia and ovarian cancer (OC) models in vitro and in vivo in OC-bearing immunodeficient mice. We used flow cytometry-based assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, microscopy-based serial killing assays, and bioluminescence imaging, for in vitro and in vivo experiments. N-803 increased HPC-NK cell proliferation and interferon (IFN)gamma production. On leukemia cells, co-culture with HPC-NK cells and N-803 increased ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, N-803 improved HPC-NK cell-mediated (serial) leukemia killing. Treating OC spheroids with HPC-NK cells and N-803 increased IFNgamma-induced CXCL10 secretion, and target killing after prolonged exposure. In immunodeficient mice bearing human OC, N-803 supported HPC-NK cell persistence in combination with total human immunoglobulins to prevent Fc-mediated HPC-NK cell depletion. Moreover, this combination treatment decreased tumor growth. In conclusion, N-803 is a promising IL-15-based compound that boosts HPC-NK cell expansion and functionality in vitro and in vivo. Adding N-803 to HPC-NK cell therapy could improve cancer immunotherapy.",,"['Van der Meer, J M R', 'Maas, R J A', 'Guldevall, K', 'Klarenaar, K', 'de Jonge, P K J D', 'Evert, J S Hoogstad-van', 'van der Waart, A B', 'Cany, J', 'Safrit, J T', 'Lee, J H', 'Wagena, E', 'Friedl, P', 'Onfelt, B', 'Massuger, L F', 'Schaap, N P M', 'Jansen, J H', 'Hobo, W', 'Dolstra, H']","['Van der Meer JMR', 'Maas RJA', 'Guldevall K', 'Klarenaar K', 'de Jonge PKJD', 'Evert JSH', 'van der Waart AB', 'Cany J', 'Safrit JT', 'Lee JH', 'Wagena E', 'Friedl P', 'Onfelt B', 'Massuger LF', 'Schaap NPM', 'Jansen JH', 'Hobo W', 'Dolstra H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Geert Grooteplein Zuid 8, P.O.

There are guidelines in place recommending such antibiotics. However, regional variations and local epidemiological data must be evaluated to tailor the antibiotics for best possible and rational use. In this study, we audited the clinical and microbiological data of febrile neutropenic episodes occurring at a tertiary care haematology institution. Three hundred and ninety-three febrile neutropenic episodes occurring in 123 patients over a 1-year period were analysed for microbial profile, sensitivity and resistance patterns, and finally clinical outcomes. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) blood stream infections (46.9%) were more prevalent as compared to gram-positive infections (41.9%). Overall mortality due to complicated neutropenic sepsis was 19.5% (24/123 patients). Increased resistance to carbapenems, beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins were observed. Cefepime and tigecycline resistance were seen in 20% and 15% GNB isolates, respectively. Chest was the most frequent focus of infection, and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) was the most common underlying disorder which correlated with the likelihood of death (p < 0.01). Multidrug-resistant GNB (esp. Klebsiella sp.) are still most worrisome isolates in neutropenic patients. Single-agent cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam/tigecycline combination may be considered empirical agents. Chest infections and AML were independent predictors of poor clinical outcome in neutropenic patients.

We report that a conserved bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) module of BAHCC1 (BAHCC1(BAH)) 'recognizes' H3K27me3 specifically and enforces silencing of H3K27me3-demarcated genes in mammalian cells. Biochemical, structural and integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing-based analyses demonstrate that direct readout of H3K27me3 by BAHCC1 is achieved through a hydrophobic trimethyl-L-lysine-binding 'cage' formed by BAHCC1(BAH), mediating colocalization of BAHCC1 and H3K27me3-marked genes. BAHCC1 is highly expressed in human acute leukemia and interacts with transcriptional corepressors. In leukemia, depletion of BAHCC1, or disruption of the BAHCC1(BAH)-H3K27me3 interaction, causes derepression of H3K27me3-targeted genes that are involved in tumor suppression and cell differentiation, leading to suppression of oncogenesis. In mice, introduction of a germline mutation at Bahcc1 to disrupt its H3K27me3 engagement causes partial postnatal lethality, supporting a role in development. This study identifies an H3K27me3-directed transduction pathway in mammals that relies on a conserved BAH 'reader'.",,"['Fan, Huitao', 'Lu, Jiuwei', 'Guo, Yiran', 'Li, Dongxu', 'Zhang, Zhi-Min',

Emerging evidence suggests that exosomes produced by leukemia blasts suppress hematopoiesis. Exosomes isolated from AML patients' plasma at diagnosis significantly and dose-dependently suppressed colony formation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Levels of HPC suppression mediated by exosomes of AML patients who achieved complete remission (CR) were significantly decreased compared to those observed at AML diagnosis. Exosomes from plasma of patients who had achieved CR but with incomplete cell count recovery (CRi) after chemotherapy suppressed in vitro colony formation as effectively as did exosomes obtained at AML diagnosis. Dipeptidylpeptidase4 (DPP4/CD26), a serine protease that cleaves select penultimate amino acids of various proteins, has been previously implicated in the regulation of hematopoiesis. DPP4 was carried by exosomes from AML plasma or leukemia cell lines. Leukemia exosomes which suppressed HSC colony formation had markedly higher DPP4 functional activity than that detected in the exosomes of normal donors. Pharmacological inhibition of DPP4 activity in AML exosomes reversed the effects of exosome-mediated myelosuppression. Reversing the negative effects of exosomes on AML hematopoiesis, and thus improving cell count recovery, might emerge as a new therapeutic approach to AML.",,"['Namburi, Swathi', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Hong, Chang-Sook', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Namburi S', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Hong CS', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. boyiadzism@upmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['R21 CA205644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL139599/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*metabolism', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2020/11/04 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/11/03 05:44'],"['2020/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/03 05:44 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01047-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01047-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jul;35(7):1925-1932. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01047-7.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a very aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lungs demanding effective therapy. In this study we investigated whether BTZ or CFZ combined with obatoclax (OBX), an antagonist for MCL-1 and a pan-BCL family inhibitor, could cause synergistic growth inhibition of SCLC cells. We showed that combined application of BTZ or CFZ with OBX caused synergistic growth inhibition of human SCLC cell lines (H82, H526, DMS79, H196, H1963, and H69) than single agent alone. Both BTZ-OBX and CFZ-OBX combinations displayed marked synergism on inducing apoptosis (~50% increase vs BTZ or CFZ alone). A comprehensive proteomics analysis revealed that BTZ preferentially induced the expression of MCL-1, an antiapoptotic protein, in SCLC cells. Thus, proteasome inhibitor-OBX combinations could specifically induce massive growth inhibition and apoptosis in SCLC cells. Subsequent proteome-wide profiling analysis of activated transcription factors suggested that BTZ- or CFZ-induced MCL-1 upregulation was transcriptionally driven by FOXM1. In nude mice bearing in SCLC H82 xenografts, both BTZ-OBX, and CFZ-OBX combinations exhibited remarkable antitumor activities against SCLC tumors evidenced by significant reduction of tumor size and the proliferation marker Ki-67 signals in tumor tissues as compared with single agent alone. Thus, proteasome inhibitor-OBX combinations are worth immediate assessments for SCLC in clinical settings.",['(c) 2020.

Members of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins are key regulators of the intrinsic, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins is associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Thus, inhibition of BCL-2 family proteins is a rational therapeutic option for malignancies that are dependent on antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Venetoclax (ABT-199, GDC-0199) is a highly selective BCL-2 inhibitor that represents the first approved agent of this class and is currently widely used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite impressive clinical activity, venetoclax monotherapy for a prolonged duration can lead to drug resistance or loss of dependence on the targeted protein. In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanism of action of BCL-2 inhibition and the role of this approach in the current treatment paradigm of B-cell malignancies. We summarize the drivers of de novo and acquired resistance to venetoclax that are closely associated with complex clonal shifts, interplay of expression and interactions of BCL-2 family members, transcriptional regulators, and metabolic modulators.

For decades, treatment options were limited to either intensive chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine-based regimens (7 + 3) or lower intensity regimens including hypomethylating agents or low dose cytarabine, followed by either allogeneic stem cell transplant or consolidation chemotherapy. Fortunately, with the influx of rapidly evolving molecular technologies and new genetic understanding, the treatment landscape for AML has dramatically changed. Advances in the formulation and delivery of 7 + 3 with liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin (Vyxeos) have improved overall survival in secondary AML. Increased understanding of the genetic underpinnings of AML has led to targeting actionable mutations such as FLT3, IDH1/2 and TP53, and BCL2 or hedgehog pathways in more frail populations. Antibody drug conjugates have resurfaced in the AML landscape and there have been numerous advances utilizing immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific T cell engager antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy and the development of AML vaccines. While there are dozens of ongoing studies and new drugs in the pipeline, this paper serves as a review of the advances achieved in the treatment of AML in the last several years and the most promising future avenues of advancement.",,"['Stanchina, Michele', 'Soong, Deborah', 'Zheng-Lin, Binbin', 'Watts, Justin M', 'Taylor, Justin']","['Stanchina M', 'Soong D', 'Zheng-Lin B', 'Watts JM', 'Taylor J']","['Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai West-Morningside, New York, NY 10025, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['AMFDP/American Society of Hematology', 'AMFDP/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy', 'Young Investigator Award/Edward P.

DNA methylation patterns in JMML have correlated with outcome across multiple studies, suggesting it as a biomarker to improve patient stratification. However, standardized approaches to classify JMML on the basis of DNA methylation patterns are lacking. We, therefore, sought to define an international consensus for DNA methylation subgroups in JMML and develop classification methods for clinical implementation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Published DNA methylation data from 255 patients with JMML were used to develop and internally validate a classifier model. Accuracy across platforms (EPIC-arrays and MethylSeq) was tested using a technical validation cohort (32 patients). The suitability of both methods for single-patient classification was demonstrated using an independent cohort (47 patients). RESULTS: Analysis of pooled, published data established three DNA methylation subgroups as a de facto standard. Unfavorable prognostic parameters (PTPN11 mutation, elevated fetal hemoglobin, and older age) were significantly enriched in the high methylation (HM) subgroup. A classifier was then developed that predicted subgroups with 98% accuracy across different technological platforms. Applying the classifier to an independent validation cohort confirmed an association of HM with secondary mutations, high relapse incidence, and inferior overall survival (OS), while the low methylation subgroup was associated with a favorable disease course. Multivariable analysis established DNA methylation subgroups as the only significant factor predicting OS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an international consensus definition for DNA methylation subgroups in JMML. We developed and validated methods which will facilitate the design of risk-stratified clinical trials in JMML.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Schonung, Maximilian', 'Meyer, Julia', 'Nollke, Peter', 'Olshen, Adam B', 'Hartmann, Mark', 'Murakami, Norihiro', 'Wakamatsu, Manabu', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Lipka, Daniel B']","['Schonung M', 'Meyer J', 'Nollke P', 'Olshen AB', 'Hartmann M', 'Murakami N', 'Wakamatsu M', 'Okuno Y', 'Plass C', 'Loh ML', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Muramatsu H', 'Flotho C', 'Stieglitz E', 'Lipka DB']","['Section Translational Cancer Epigenomics, Division Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) & National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California.', 'Section Translational Cancer Epigenomics, Division Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) & National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Medical Genomics Center, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division Cancer Epigenomics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), partner site Freiburg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California.', 'Section Translational Cancer Epigenomics, Division Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) & National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany. d.lipka@dkfz.de.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['U54 CA196519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA082103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL135434/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 CA199389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Consensus', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/methods/standards']",PMC7785676,,2020/11/04 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2020/11/03 05:37'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/03 05:37 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-20-3184 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3184 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Jan 1;27(1):158-168. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3184.

The impaired immune response is mainly due to T lymphocytes (CD8 and T regulatory cells) with increased cell apoptosis. MDS could be associated in some cases with various clinical dysimmune features; however, only MDS with trisomy 8 is correlated with particular clinical phenotype. The latter is mainly Behcet's-like disease which includes orogenital aphtosis, skin features and severe ulcerative digestive disease of ileocaecal distribution. Other clinical manifestations, such as arthritis or neutrophilic dermatosis, have been also described in MDS patients with trisomy 8. The dysimmune manifestations, and among them the Behcet's-like disease, do not impact the overall survival or the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, and among them TNF-alpha inhibitors, are usually ineffective to control the dysimmune manifestations. Targeting the underlying clonal disease with specific therapies, such as azacitidine, seems to be the best strategy to control these disorders, even in MDS patients with low-risk disease.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the majority of studies on drug repositioning in hematology concern acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma, numerous studies are present in the literature on the possibility of using these drugs also in other hematological diseases, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and lymphomas. Numerous anti-infectious drugs and chemical entities used for the therapy of neurological or endocrine diseases, oral antidiabetics, statins and medications used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, bisphosphonate and natural substance such as artemisin and curcumin, have found a place in the treatment of hematological diseases.

Resazurin assay was used to evaluate cytotoxic and ferroptosis activity, apoptosis, and modulation in the cell cycle phase were investigated via Annexin V-FITC/PI dual stain and cell-cycle arrest assays. Furthermore, we used western blotting assay for the determination of autophagy cell death. n-Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and butanol fractions of T. vulgaris and A. lappa exhibited cytotoxicity in CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR 5000 cell lines at concentration range 0.001-100 mug/mL with potential activity revealed by chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions. NCI-H929 displayed pronounced sensitivity towards T. vulgaris (TCF) and A. lappa (ACF) chloroform fractions with IC50 values of 6.49 +/- 1.48 and 21.9 +/- 0.69 mug/mL, respectively. TCF induced apoptosis in NCI-H929 cells with a higher ratio (71%), compared to ACF (50%) at 4 x IC50. ACF demonstrated more potent autophagy activity than TCF. TCF and ACF induced cell cycle arrest and ferroptosis. Apigenin and nobiletin were identified in TCF, while nobiletin, ursolic acid, and lupeol were the main compounds identified in ACF.

Interestingly, HTLV-1 endemic areas coincide with regions citing high prevalence of S. stercoralis infection, making these communities optimal for elucidating the pathogenesis of co-infection and its clinical significance. HTLV-1 co-infection with S. stercoralis has been observed for decades in a number of published patient cases and case series; however, the implications of this co-infection remain elusive. Thus far, data suggest that S. stercoralis increases proviral load in patients co-infected with HTLV-1 compared to HTLV-1 infection alone. Furthermore, co-infection with HTLV-1 has been associated with shifting the immune response from Th2 to Th1, affecting the ability of the immune system to address the helminth infection. Thus, despite this well-known association, further research is required to fully elucidate the impact of each pathogen on disease manifestations in co-infected patients. This review provides an analytical view of studies that have evaluated the variation within HTLV-1 patients in susceptibility to S. stercoralis infection, as well as the effects of strongyloidiasis on HTLV-1 pathogenesis. Further, it provides a compilation of available clinical reports on the epidemiology and pathology of HTLV-1 with parasitic co-infection as well as data from mechanistic studies suggesting possible immunopathogenic mechanisms.

This study aimed to identify clusters of acute childhood leukemia (ACL) cases and analyze their relationship with proximity to industrial sources of air pollution in three capital cities in Colombia during 2000-2015. Incident ACL cases were obtained from the population cancer registries for the cities of Bucaramanga, Cali, and Medellin. The inventory of industrial sources of emissions to the air was obtained from the regional environmental authorities and industrial conglomerates were identified. The Kulldorf's circular scan test was used to detect city clusters and to identify clusters around industrial conglomerates. Multivariable spatial modeling assessed the effect of distance and direction from the industrial conglomerates controlling for socioeconomic status. We identified industrials sectors within a buffer of 1 km around industrial conglomerates related to the ACL clusters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Viability and proliferative activity of the Graffi myeloid tumour cells was assessed by MTT test. The morphological alterations were visualized and analysed by fluorescent microscopy after intravital double staining. An in vivo model of Graffi tumour bearing hamsters was used to examine the influence of PSM on transplantability, tumour growth, survival and mortality as well as to observe pathomorphological changes. RESULTS: Graffi tumour cells were sensitive to purified saponins' mixture after 24 and 48 h treatment. The treatment induced a statistically significant decrease of the viability/proliferation of the Graffi tumour cells. These effects were concentration- and time-dependent. Fluorescent microscopy studies showed that these antiproliferative effects were connected to the induction of apoptosis. The in vivo study showed the presence of a stromal component, single mononuclear cells in the stroma. Multiple incorrect mitotic figures were observed in the tumour tissue from the control group. Well-formed stroma with accumulation of mononuclear cells and mitotic cells were found in the group, treated with PSM. The tumour weight was decreased in the group, treated with PMS.

A survey by the SIOPE radiation oncology working group.,S0167-8140(20)30879-3 [pii] 10.1016/j.radonc.2020.10.032 [doi],"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To reduce relapse risk, Total Body Irradiation (TBI) is part of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric acute leukemia. The study purpose was to evaluate clinical practices regarding TBI, such as fractionation, organ shielding and delivery techniques, among SIOPE affiliated radiotherapy centers. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent out to 233 SIOPE affiliated centers, containing 57 questions about clinical practice of TBI. Surveys could be answered anonymously. RESULTS: From over 25 countries, 82 responses were collected. For TBI-performing centers, 40/48 irradiated </=10 pediatric patients annually (range: 1-2 to >25). Most indications concerned acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Four different fractionation schedules were used, of which 12 Gy in 6 fractions was applied in 91% for ALL and 86% for AML. Dose reduction to the lungs, mostly to a mean dose of 8-10 Gy, was applied by 28/33 centers for ALL and 19/21 centers for AML, in contrast to much less applied dose reduction to the kidneys (7/33 ALL and 7/21 AML), thyroid (2/33 ALL and 2/21 AML), liver (4/33 ALL and 3/21 AML) and lenses (4/33 ALL and 4/21 AML). Conventional TBI techniques were used by 24/29 responding centers, while 5/29 used advanced optimized planning techniques. CONCLUSION: Across SIOPE, there is a high level of uniformity in fractionation and use of lung shielding. Practices vary regarding other organs-at-risk shielding and implementation of advanced techniques. A SIOPE radiotherapy working group will be established to define international guidelines for pediatric TBI.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

U2AF1 mutations have been identified in most cancers but are prevalent in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and the most common mutation is a missense substitution of serine-34 to phenylalanine (S34F). The U2AF heterodimer also has a noncanonical function as a translational regulator. Here, we report that the U2AF1-S34F mutation results in specific misregulation of the translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis machinery. The net result is an increase in mRNA translation at the single-cell level. Among the translationally up-regulated targets of U2AF1-S34F is Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), which is a major driver of myeloid malignancy. Depletion of NPM1 impairs the viability of the U2AF1-S34F mutant cells and causes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing defects, thus indicating an unanticipated synthetic interaction between U2AF1, NPM1, and ribosome biogenesis.

These cases represented 25% of a cohort of 221 such specimens. The patients were 19 to 49 years old (mean, 28 y) and 98% had serological evidence of yolk sac tumor. The vasculogenic lesions, felt to represent a neoplastic reiteration of embryonic vasculogenesis in the splanchnic mesoderm of the yolk sac, were further subdivided into teratoma with vasculogenic stroma (n=9), vasculogenic mesenchymal tumor (VMT) (n=42, further classified into low grade [n=24] and high grade [n=18]), and angiosarcoma (n=4). The distinction of teratoma with vasculogenic stroma from VMT was based solely on the greater extent of VMT (exceeding 1 low power [x4 objective] microscopic field), with both categories showing a spectrum of vessels lined by atypical endothelium in a nonendothelial neoplastic stroma that often also generated vascular walls comprised of atypical smooth muscle. The angiosarcomas showed stratification of highly atypical endothelial cells or anastomosing vessels lined by nonstratified but cytologically similar endothelium. Immunohistochemical studies supported the generation of neoplastic vessels from the tumor stroma, most commonly by the development of stromal clefts showing reactivity for podoplanin, CD34, and occasionally ERG, followed by the gradual development from the clefts of thin-walled vessels that later became encircled by stromal cells showing smooth muscle differentiation by immunohistochemistry. Occasionally, round collections of stromal erythrocytes became surrounded by stromal cells to generate blood vessels. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed chromosome 12p copy number increase in both the endothelial component and stromal component in 8/9 VMT cases and in 1/1 angiosarcoma. On follow-up, no patient with teratoma with vasculogenic stroma had evidence of a subsequent vascular tumor or sarcoma, whereas 8 of the 35 (23%) patients with VMTs (2 low grade and 6 high grade) and meaningful follow-up developed sarcoma (1 angiosarcoma, 2 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 5 not further characterized). The difference between low-grade and high-grade tumors was of borderline significance (P=0.058). Two of the 4 patients with angiosarcoma died of metastatic angiosarcoma, with the other 2 disease-free at 6.8 and 7 years. Compared with the 165 patients with follow-up and no vasculogenic lesions, there was a highly significant (P=4.3x10-5) association of any vasculogenic lesion with sarcomatoid tumors during the clinical course of VMT patients. In addition, 5/46 patients with follow-up and vasculogenic lesions (11%) died of either leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome compared with 2 of 166 (1%) lacking them (P=0.0012). Three of the 5 patients had identifiable immature hematopoietic cells within their vasculogenic lesions, but 4 other VMT patients with these did not develop leukemia or myelodysplasia. We conclude: (1) vasculogenic lesions are frequent in postchemotherapy resections of primary mediastinal germ cell tumors with yolk sac tumor components; (2) they mostly consist of neoplastic vessels in a stroma that also generates neoplastic vascular walls of smooth muscle; (3) VMTs are associated with an increased incidence of sarcomas, even though most vasculogenic lesions in this context do not meet criteria for angiosarcoma; (4) the presence of vasculogenic lesions in postchemotherapy resections of primary mediastinal germ cell tumors place patients at increased risk for leukemia or myelodysplasia.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We characterized seven genomic mutational signatures, including two B cell tumor-specific signatures, one of which is novel and associated with aberrant SHM. We further identified two major mutational signatures (K1 and K2) of clustered mutations (kataegis) resulting from the activities of AID or error-prone DNA polymerase eta, respectively. K1 was associated with the immunoglobulin (Ig) switch region mutations/translocations and the ABC subtype of DLBCL, whereas K2 was related to the Ig variable region mutations and the GCB subtype of DLBCL and FL.

Given that this compound is particularly active against B-cell malignancies, we have been suggested that it can alleviate immune complexes (ICs)-mediated conditions, especially IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The therapeutic effects of Tris DBA on glomerular cell proliferation and renal inflammation and mechanism of action were examined in a mouse model of IgAN. Treatment of IgAN mice with Tris DBA resulted in markedly improved renal function, albuminuria and renal pathology, including glomerular cell proliferation, neutrophil infiltration, sclerosis and periglomerular inflammation in the renal interstitium, together with (Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2011, 6, 1301-1307) reduced mitochondrial ROS generation; (Am J Physiol-Renal Physiol. 2011. 301, F1218-F1230) differentially regulated autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome; (Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2012, 7, 427-436) inhibited phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK signalling pathways, and priming signal of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and (Free Radic Biol Med. 2013, 61, 285-297) blunted NLRP3 inflammasome activation through SIRT1- and SIRT3-mediated autophagy induction, in renal tissues or cultured macrophages. In conclusion, Tris DBA effectively ameliorated the mouse IgAN model and targeted signalling pathways downstream of ICs-mediated interaction, which is a novel immunomodulatory strategy.

However, the exact levels of NG2 positivity that predict the presence of KMT2A rearrangement are not known. The current study focuses on a cohort of 505 pediatric AL patients who showed any level of positive NG2 expression (greater than 1% of cells) for whom comprehensive genetic data were available. NG2 expression was measured as either the percentage of positive cells or the number of molecules on the cell surface. KMT2A gene rearrangements were identified by FISH. The fusion partner was detected with RT-PCR, LDI-PCR or anchored multiplex PCR followed by high-throughput sequencing. KMT2A-positive samples comprised a substantial proportion of the NG2-positive cohort (180 of 505, 36%), with a total of 19 different types of translocation. Despite its occurrence in other AL genetic subgroups, NG2 expression was significantly increased in AL patients with KMT2A rearrangements in terms of both the cell percentage and number of molecules per cell. The threshold levels (TL) for NG2-positivity were established by ROC analysis of the whole cohort and separately for children less than 1 years old and older with lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid (AML) leukemia. The lowest TL was defined in infants with ALL (7%), while in older children, the threshold was higher (12%). In AML patients, the situation was reversed, with 28% NG2-positivity in infants and 14% in patients >1 year old. The defined TLs resulted in improved diagnostic performance compared to the conventional thresholds of 10% and 20% for all patient groups.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Zerkalenkova, Elena', 'Mikhaylova, Ekaterina', 'Lebedeva, Svetlana', 'Illarionova, Olga', 'Baidun, Liudmila', 'Kashpor, Svetlana', 'Osipova, Elena', 'Maschan, Michael', 'Maschan, Alexey', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Olshanskaya, Yulia', 'Popov, Alexander']","['Zerkalenkova E', 'Mikhaylova E', 'Lebedeva S', 'Illarionova O', 'Baidun L', 'Kashpor S', 'Osipova E', 'Maschan M', 'Maschan A', 'Novichkova G', 'Olshanskaya Y', 'Popov A']","['Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', ""Russian Children's Clinical Hospital, Moscow, Russia."", 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Proteoglycans/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2020/11/03 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2020/11/02 06:26'],"['2020/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/11/02 06:26 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22915 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2021 Feb;60(2):88-99. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22915.

Velocity of response has unexpectedly proved less important than hitherto thought, does not predict survival, and is of unclear relevance for treatment-free remission (TFR). Serious and cumulative toxicity has been observed with tyrosine kinase inhibitors that had been expected to replace imatinib. Generic imatinib has become cost-effective first-line treatment in chronic phase despite chronic low-grade side-effects in many patients. Earlier recognition of end-phase by genetic assessment might improve prospects for blast crisis (BC). TFR has become an important new treatment goal of CML.

This male predominance is also seen for most birth defects, which are strongly associated with risk of childhood cancer. We conducted mediation analysis to estimate whether the increased risk of cancer among males is partially explained by birth defect status. Methods: We used a population-based birth cohort with linked data from birth certificates, birth defects registries, and cancer registries from Arkansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas. We conducted counterfactual mediation analysis to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects of sex on cancer risk, modeling birth defect status as mediator. State; birth year; plurality; and maternal race and ethnicity, age, and education were considered confounders. We conducted separate analyses limited to cancers diagnosed younger than 1 year of age. Results: Our dataset included 10 181 074 children: 15 110 diagnosed with cancer, 539 567 diagnosed with birth defects, and 2124 co-occurring cases. Birth defect status mediated 38% of the association between sex and cancer overall. The proportion mediated varied by cancer type, including acute myeloid leukemia (93%), neuroblastoma (35%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%). Among children younger than 1 year of age at cancer diagnosis, the proportion mediated was substantially higher (82%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that birth defects mediate a statistically significant proportion of the relationship between sex and childhood cancer. The proportion mediated varied by cancer type and diagnosis age. These findings improve our understanding of the causal pathway underlying male sex as a risk factor for childhood cancer.",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Obesity's influence on advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is relatively unexplored. Methods: We conducted a prospective body mass index (BMI) companion study in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (now Alliance)/SWOG 80405, a phase III metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment trial. BMI was measured at trial registration. Primary and secondary endpoints were overall and progression-free survival, respectively. To minimize confounding by poor and rapidly declining health, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for known prognostic factors, comorbidities, physical activity, and weight loss during the 6 months prior to study entry. We also examined weight loss prior to enrollment as an independent predictor of patient outcome. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among 2323 patients with mCRC, there were no statistically significant associations between BMI and overall or progression-free survival (adjusted P trend = .12 and .40, respectively). Weight loss during the 6 months prior to study entry was associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival; compared with individuals with stable weight +/-4.9%, individuals with weight loss greater than 15% experienced an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.52 for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26 to 1.84; P trend < .001) and of 1.23 for disease progression or death (95% CI = 1.02 to 1.47; P trend = .006).

The California Cancer Registry, used to identify treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed between 2009 and 2014, was linked with the statewide hospitalization database to determine cumulative incidences of UE DVT and subsequent VTE and bleeding after UE DVT diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of UE DVT on the risk of subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE) or lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LE DVT) and subsequent bleeding, and the impact of UE DVT on mortality. There were 5,072 patients identified: 3,252 had AML and 1,820 had ALL. Three- and 12-month cumulative incidences of UE DVT were 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1-5.6) and 6.6% (95% CI: 5.8-7.5) for AML and 4.1% (95% CI: 3.2-5.1) and 5.9% (95% CI: 4.9-7.1) for ALL, respectively. Twelve-month cumulative incidences of subsequent VTE after an incident UE DVT diagnosis were 5.3% for AML and 12.2% for ALL. Twelve-month cumulative incidences of subsequent bleeding after an incident UE DVT diagnosis were 15.4% for AML and 21.1% for ALL. UE DVT was associated with an increased risk of subsequent bleeding for both AML (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.60-2.68) and ALL (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.02-2.57) but was not an independent risk factor for subsequent PE or LE DVT for either leukemia subtype. Isolated incident UE DVT was associated with increased leukemia-specific mortality for AML (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.16-1.73) and ALL (HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.31-2.47). UE DVT is a relatively common complication among patients with AML and ALL and has a significant impact on bleeding and mortality. Further research is needed to determine appropriate therapy for this high-risk population.","['The Author(s).

Six N-alkyl-2-halophenazin-1-ones, including WS-9659 B and marinocyanins A and B, were synthesized by the direct oxidative condensation of 4-halo-1,2,3-benzenetriol with the corresponding N-alkylbenzene-1,2-diamines. One of the most significant features of the present method is that it can be successfully applied to the synthesis of N-alkyl-2-chlorophenazin-1-ones. The traditional chlorination of N-alkyl-phenazin-1-ones with N-chlorosuccinimide selectively occurs at the 4-position to afford the undesired N-alkyl-4-chlorophenazin-1-ones. Our synthetic route successfully circumvents this problem, culminating in the first chemical synthesis of WS-9659 B. The cytotoxicity of six N-alkyl-2-halophenazin-1-ones and three N-alkylphenazin-1-ones against human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, human lung cancer A549, and normal MRC-5 cells was evaluated.

Allo-HCT in combination with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is considered a promising treatment option for millions of patients with HIV+ and acute myeloid leukemia. Most currently available HSC gene therapy approaches target CD34-enriched cell fractions, a heterogeneous mix of mostly progenitor cells and only very few HSCs with long-term multilineage engraftment potential. As a consequence, gene therapy approaches are currently limited in their HSC targeting efficiency, very expensive consuming huge quantities of modifying reagents, and can lead to unwanted side effects in nontarget cells. We have previously shown that purified CD34(+)CD90(+)CD45RA(-) cells are enriched for multipotent HSCs with long-term multilineage engraftment potential, which can reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system in an autologous nonhuman primate transplant model. Here, we tested the feasibility of transplantation with purified CD34(+)CD90(+)CD45RA(-) cells in the allogeneic setting in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, CD34(+)CD90(+)CD45RA(-) cells from 2 fully major histocompatibility complex-matched, full sibling rhesus macaques were sort-purified, quality controlled, and transplanted. Engraftment and donor chimerism were evaluated in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of both animals. Results: Despite limited survival due to infectious complications, we show that the large-scale sort-purification and transplantation of CD34(+)CD90(+)CD45RA(-) cells is technically feasible and leads to rapid engraftment of cells in bone marrow in the allogeneic setting and absence of cotransferred T cells. Conclusions: We show that purification of an HSC-enriched CD34(+) subset can serve as a potential stem cell source for allo-HCTs. Most importantly, the combination of allo-HCT and HSC gene therapy has the potential to treat a wide array of hematologic and nonhematologic disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

The first EBL outbreak in Egypt was reported in 1997. To date, there are few studies regarding BLV diagnosis using only serological detection and no studies investigating the distribution of BLV provirus, which is the retroviral genome integrated into the host genome, in Egypt. The genetic characteristics of Egyptian BLV strains are also unknown. Therefore, we aimed to detect BLV provirus and determine BLV genetic variability among dairy cattle in Egypt. We collected 270 blood samples of dairy cattle from 24 farms located in five provinces in Egypt. Out of the 270 samples, 58 (21.5%) were positive for BLV provirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18 420-bp selected sequences out of 50 isolates of the BLV env-gp51 gene demonstrated that Egyptian BLV isolates were clustered into genotype-1 and-4, among 11 genotypes detected worldwide. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis and alignment of the 501-bp sequence of the env-gp51 gene revealed that at least six genetically different strains are present in Egypt. Genotype-1 isolates comprised four different strains (G1-a, G1-b, G1-c, and G1-d) and genotype-4 isolates included two different strains (G4-x and G4-y). Moreover, in one farm with 100% infection rate, we identified three isolates of G1-a strain, 35 isolates of G4-x strain, and two isolates of G4-y strain. Overall, this study provides the new report on molecular prevalence of BLV in Egypt and records the coexistence of BLV genotype-1 and-4 in Egyptian cattle.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Hamada, Metwally, Polat, Borjigin, Ali, Abdel-Hady, Mohamed,', 'Wada and Aida.']","['Hamada, Rania', 'Metwally, Samy', 'Polat, Meripet', 'Borjigin, Liushiqi', 'Ali, Alsagher O', 'Abdel-Hady, A A A', 'Mohamed, Adel E A', 'Wada, Satoshi', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Hamada R', 'Metwally S', 'Polat M', 'Borjigin L', 'Ali AO', 'Abdel-Hady AAA', 'Mohamed AEA', 'Wada S', 'Aida Y']","['Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Saitama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Damanhour University, Damanhour, Egypt.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Saitama, Japan.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Department of Surgery, Anaesthesiology and Radiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Department of Animal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Photonics Control Technology Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Saitama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,,,PMC7511665,,2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:20'],"['2020/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 06:20 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2020.00608 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2020 Sep 10;7:608. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2020.00608. eCollection 2020.,608,,20200910,['NOTNLM'],"['BLV genotype', 'Egypt', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'dairy cattle', 'prevalence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strong evidence exists for a crucial role of B cell receptor (BCR) triggering, either by (self-)antigen or by receptor auto-engagement in the lymph node (LN) to drive CLL proliferation and provide adhesion. The clinical success of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is widely accepted to be based on blockade of the BCR signal. Additional signals in the LN that support CLL survival derive from surrounding cells, such as CD40L-presenting T helper cells, myeloid and stromal cells. It is not quite clear if and to what extent these non-BCR signals contribute to proliferation in situ. In vitro BCR triggering, in contrast, leads to low-level activation and does not result in cell division. Various combinations of non-BCR signals delivered via co-stimulatory receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and/or soluble cytokines are applied, leading to comparatively modest and short-lived CLL proliferation in vitro. Thus, an unresolved gap exists between the condition in the patient as we now understand it and applicable knowledge that can be harnessed in the laboratory for future therapeutic applications. Even in this era of targeted drugs, CLL remains largely incurable with frequent relapses and emergence of resistance. Therefore, we require better insight into all aspects of CLL growth and potential rewiring of signaling pathways. We aim here to provide an overview of in vivo versus in vitro signals involved in CLL proliferation, point out areas of missing knowledge and suggest future directions for research.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Haselager, Kater and Eldering.']","['Haselager, Marco V', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Haselager MV', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic University Medical Center, location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic University Medical Center, location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic University Medical Center, location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, LYMMCARE, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7578574,,2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:20'],"['2020/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 06:20 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.592205 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 8;10:592205. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.592205. eCollection 2020.,592205,,20201008,['NOTNLM'],"['CD40', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'crosstalk', 'micro-environment', 'proliferation', 'toll-like receptor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These transcripts that are over 200 nucleotides long were soon recognized for their importance in regulating gene expression. However, their poor conservation among species and their still controversial annotation has limited their study to some extent. Moreover, a generally lower expression of lncRNAs as compared to protein coding genes and their enigmatic biochemical mechanisms have impeded progress in the understanding of their biological roles. It is, however, known that lncRNAs engage in various kinds of interactions and can form complexes with other RNAs, with genomic DNA or proteins rendering their functional regulatory network quite complex. It has emerged from recent studies that lncRNAs exert important roles in gene expression that affect many cellular processes underlying development, cellular differentiation, but also the pathogenesis of blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. A number of lncRNAs have been found to be regulated by several well-known transcription factors including Myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC). The c-MYC gene is known to be one of the most frequently deregulated oncogenes and a driver for many human cancers. The c-MYC gene is very frequently activated by chromosomal translocations in hematopoietic cancers most prominently in B- or T-cell lymphoma or leukemia and much is already known about its role as a DNA binding transcriptional regulator. Although the understanding of MYC's regulatory role controlling lncRNA expression and how MYC itself is controlled by lncRNA in blood cancers is still at the beginning, an intriguing picture emerges indicating that c-MYC may execute part of its oncogenic function through lncRNAs. Several studies have identified lncRNAs regulating c-MYC expression and c-MYC regulated lncRNAs in different blood cancers and have unveiled new mechanisms how these RNA molecules act. In this review, we give an overview of lncRNAs that have been recognized as critical in the context of activated c-MYC in leukemia and lymphoma, describe their mechanism of action and their effect on transcriptional reprogramming in cancer cells. Finally, we discuss possible ways how an interference with their molecular function could be exploited for new cancer therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Arman and Moroy.'],"['Arman, Kaifee', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Arman K', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7579998,,2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:20'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 06:20 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.579940 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 8;10:579940. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.579940. eCollection 2020.,579940,,20201008,['NOTNLM'],"['MYC', 'hematological malignancies', 'leukemia', 'long non-coding RNAs', 'lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, early recurrence is still an important threat to the survival of patients. In this study, we used integrated bioinformatics analysis to look for biomarkers of early recurrence of B-cell ALL (B-ALL) in childhood and adolescent patients. Firstly, we obtained gene expression profiles from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on whether the disease relapsed early. LASSO and Cox regression analysis were applied to identify a subset of four genes: HOXA7, S100A11, S100A10, and IFI44L. A genetic risk score model was constructed based on these four optimal prognostic genes. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive value of this prognostic model (3-, 5-, and 10-year AUC values >0.7). The risk model was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and event-free survival in B-ALL (all p < 0.0001). In addition, a high risk score was an independent poor prognostic risk factor for OS (p < 0.001; HR = 3.396; 95% CI: 2.387-4.832). Finally, the genetic risk model was successfully tested in B-ALL using an external validation set. The results suggested that this model could be a novel predictive tool for early recurrence and prognosis of B-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Huang, Li, Chen, Jiang, Wang and Hu.']","['Huang, Yan', 'Li, Jiazheng', 'Chen, Yanxin', 'Jiang, Peifang', 'Wang, Lingyan', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Huang Y', 'Li J', 'Chen Y', 'Jiang P', 'Wang L', 'Hu J']","['Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7550668,,2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:20'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 06:20 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.565455 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 29;10:565455. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.565455. eCollection 2020.,565455,,20200929,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'differential gene expression', 'early recurrence', 'genetic risk score model', 'microRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It accounts for 20% of all B cell ALL cases and is similar to BCR-ABL1 in gene expression profile but lacks BCR-ABL fusion. It is highly heterogeneous and is characterized by genetic alterations that activate kinase and cytokine receptor signaling. Most of these alterations are amenable to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ph-like ALL is prevalent in pediatric and young adults, more common in males, and frequently seen in patients with Hispanic ancestry. It is associated with inadequate response to induction therapy, high minimal residual disease (MRD) levels, and increased risk of relapse. Overall survival and event-free survival are also inferior in these patients as compared to non-Ph-like ALL. In the clinical practice, low-density array, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), flow cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization are used to identify genetic alteration in these patients. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), our understanding of disease pathogenesis and precision medicine has been improved. In this review, we analyzed data from several studies that used NGS as one of the diagnostic methods to identify genomic lesions in this high-risk subtype of B cell ALL. Studies have shown that NGS is a vital technique to identify various genomic lesions at diagnosis and throughout the treatment that can be missed by the widely used current methods. NGS has improved our understanding of various genomic lesions associated with Ph-like ALL and has helped define disease pathogenesis, MRD evaluation, and stratify therapy to prevent over or under treatment. We are in the era of precision medicine. Therefore unbiased, comprehensive genomic characterization of Ph-like ALL is important to implicate treatment directed against these genomic lesions and improve outcomes in these patients. We also analyzed data from studies that compared NGS with multi-flow cytometry and RQ-PCR for the evaluation of MRD. In the future, more extensive prospective studies are required to confirm the prognostic usefulness of NGS.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Sherali et al.']","['Sherali, Nazleen', 'Hamadneh, Tariq', 'Aftab, Saba', 'Alfonso, Michael', 'Tsouklidis, Nicholas']","['Sherali N', 'Hamadneh T', 'Aftab S', 'Alfonso M', 'Tsouklidis N']","['Medicine, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro, PAK.', 'Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Ophthalmology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, CHN.', 'Ophthalmology, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Medicine, Hamdard College of Medicine and Dentistry, Karachi, PAK.', 'Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Health Care Administration, University of Cincinnati Health, Cincinnati, USA.', 'Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Medicine, Atlantic University School of Medicine, Gros Islet, LCA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC7594661,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:18'],"['2020/11/02 06:18 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.10696 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Sep 28;12(9):e10696. doi: 10.7759/cureus.10696.,e10696,,20200928,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bcr-abl like all', 'minimal residual disease', 'next-generation sequencing', 'philadelphia chromosome like acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all leukemia patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT between January 2010 and December 2018. The clinical, radiological, electroencephalographic, and CSF features of those with HHV6 encephalitis were recorded. Results: A total of five cases of HHV6 encephalitis were identified. Three patients had Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, one had Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and one had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. All of them presented a few months after transplantation with altered mental status. Comorbidities included pancytopenia, sepsis, graft versus host disease, and multi-organ failure. EEG showed focal seizures originating from temporal lobes in two patients, generalized or focal periodic discharges in three patients, focal slowing in two patients, and diffuse slowing in three patients. MRI brain showed T2/FLAIR hyper-intensities in four patients; two of them in bilateral temporal lobes, one in the thalamus/hypothalamus/brainstem/cerebellum/basal ganglia, and one in the periventricular areas.

Aqueous extract presented the highest content of punicalagins (alpha pun = 562.26 +/- 47.14 mg/L and beta pun = 1,251.13 +/- 22.21 mg/L) and the lowest content of ellagic acid (66.38 +/- 0.21 mg/L), and it promoted a significant impairment of the cell cycle S phase. In fact, punicalagin-enriched fraction, but not an ellagic acid-enriched fraction, caused an S phase cell cycle arrest. All extracts increased the number of apoptotic cells. Punicalagin-enriched fraction increased the percentage of cells with fragmented DNA, which was intensified by ellagic acid combination. The treatment combining punicalagin and ellagic acid fractions increased the apoptotic cleaved PARP1 protein and reduced the activation of the growth-related mTOR pathway. Thus, these results evidence that solvent choice is critical for the phenolic compounds profile of pomegranate peel extracts and their biological activities.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Together with CDK4, it phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. In tumour cells, CDK6 is frequently upregulated and CDK4/6 kinase inhibitors like palbociclib possess high activity in breast cancer and other malignancies. Besides its crucial catalytic function, kinase-independent roles of CDK6 have been described. Therefore, targeted degradation of CDK6 may be advantageous over kinase inhibition. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) structurally based on the cereblon (CRBN) ligand thalidomide have recently been described to degrade the targets CDK4/6. However, CRBN-based PROTACs have several limitations including the remaining activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) on Ikaros transcription factors as well as CRBN inactivation as a resistance mechanism in cancer. Here, we systematically explored the chemical space of CDK4/6 PROTACs by addressing different E3 ligases and connecting their respective small-molecule binders via various linkers to palbociclib. The spectrum of CDK6-specific PROTACs was extended to von Hippel Lindau (VHL) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) that are essential for most cancer cells and therefore less likely to be inactivated. Our VHL-based PROTAC series included compounds that were either specific for CDK6 or exhibited dual activity against CDK4 and CDK6. IAP-based PROTACs caused a combined degradation of CDK4/6 and IAPs resulting in synergistic effects on cancer cell growth. Our new degraders showed potent and long-lasting degrading activity in human and mouse cells and inhibited proliferation of several leukemia, myeloma and breast cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we show that VHL- and IAP-based PROTACs are an attractive approach for targeted degradation of CDK4/6 in cancer.",['This journal is (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.'],"['Steinebach, Christian', 'Ng, Yuen Lam Dora', 'Sosic, Izidor', 'Lee, Chih-Shia', 'Chen, Sirui', 'Lindner, Stefanie', 'Vu, Lan Phuong', 'Bricelj, Alesa', 'Haschemi, Reza', 'Monschke, Marius', 'Steinwarz, Elisabeth', 'Wagner, Karl G', 'Bendas, Gerd', 'Luo, Ji', 'Gutschow, Michael', 'Kronke, Jan']","['Steinebach C', 'Ng YLD', 'Sosic I', 'Lee CS', 'Chen S', 'Lindner S', 'Vu LP', 'Bricelj A', 'Haschemi R', 'Monschke M', 'Steinwarz E', 'Wagner KG', 'Bendas G', 'Luo J', 'Gutschow M', 'Kronke J']","['Pharmaceutical Institute , Department of Pharmaceutical & Medicinal Chemistry , University of Bonn , An der Immenburg 4 , 53121 Bonn , Germany .

Despite the high CR rates, a subset of the patients with complete remission still relapse. The mechanism of development of resistance is not clearly understood. Some patients have been reported to demonstrate antigen-positive relapse, whereas others show antigen-negative relapses. Patients who relapse following CAR T-cell therapy, have very poor prognosis and novel approaches to overcome resistance are required urgently.

Low-dose radiation (LDR) is delivered during medical diagnoses or by an exposure to radioactive elements and has been linked to the occurrence of chronic diseases, such as leukemia and cardiovascular diseases. Though epidemiological research is indispensable for predicting and dealing with LDR-induced abnormalities in individuals exposed to LDR, little is known about epidemiological markers of LDR exposure. Moreover, difference in the LDR-induced molecular events in each organ has been an obstacle to a thorough investigation of the LDR effects and a validation of the experimental results in in vivo models. In this review, we summarized the recent reports on LDR-induced risk of organ-specifically arranged the alterations for a comprehensive understanding of the biological effects of LDR. We suggested that LDR basically caused the accumulation of DNA damages, controlled systemic immune systems, induced oxidative damages on peripheral organs, and even benefited the viability in some organs. Furthermore, we concluded that understanding of organ-specific responses and the biological markers involved in the responses is needed to investigate the precise biological effects of LDR.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Shin, Lee, Kang, Kim, Kim, Youn, Jin, Seo and Youn.']","['Shin, Eunguk', 'Lee, Sungmin', 'Kang, Hyunkoo', 'Kim, Jeongha', 'Kim, Kyeongmin', 'Youn, HyeSook', 'Jin, Young Woo', 'Seo, Songwon', 'Youn, BuHyun']","['Shin E', 'Lee S', 'Kang H', 'Kim J', 'Kim K', 'Youn H', 'Jin YW', 'Seo S', 'Youn B']","['Department of Integrated Biological Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Integrated Biological Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Integrated Biological Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Integrated Biological Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Integrated Biological Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Laboratory of Low Dose Risk Assessment, National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Laboratory of Low Dose Risk Assessment, National Radiation Emergency Medical Center, Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Integrated Biological Science, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC7565684,,2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:15'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 06:15 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.566244 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Oct 2;11:566244. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.566244. eCollection 2020.,566244,,20201002,['NOTNLM'],"['animal model', 'biological marker', 'human', 'low-dose radiation', 'organ-specificity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rs2910164(G>C) may modify the expression of the miR-146a gene, which might influence an individual's predisposition to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, inconsistent findings have been reported on the association between the rs2910164(G>C) polymorphism and the risk of childhood ALL. Methods: A comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to accurately estimate the association between the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and childhood ALL among four different genetic models. Results: This meta-analysis included Asian studies with a total of 1,543 patients and 1,816 controls. We observed a significant difference between patients and controls for the additive model (CC vs. GG: OR = 1.598, 95% CI: 1.003-2.545, P = 0.049) using a random effects model. Meanwhile, there was a trend of increased childhood ALL risk in the dominant model (CC + CG vs. GG: OR = 1.501, 95% CI: 0.976-2.307, P = 0.065), recessive model (CC vs. GG + CG: OR = 1.142, 95% CI: 0.946-1.380, P = 0.168) and allele model (C vs. G: OR = 1.217, 95% CI: 0.987-1.500, P = 0.066) between patients and controls. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the miR-146a rs2910164 CC genotype was significantly associated with childhood ALL susceptibility.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Zou, Yin, Ye, Zeng, Tian, Wang, Chen and Chen.']","['Zou, Dehua', 'Yin, Jingwen', 'Ye, Zhonglv', 'Zeng, Qiaoli', 'Tian, Chuan', 'Wang, Yajun', 'Chen, Qikang', 'Chen, Riling']","['Zou D', 'Yin J', 'Ye Z', 'Zeng Q', 'Tian C', 'Wang Y', 'Chen Q', 'Chen R']","[""Maternal and Child Research Institute, Shunde Women and Children's Hospital, Guangdong Medical University, Foshan, China."", 'Department of Psychiatry, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China.', ""Maternal and Child Research Institute, Shunde Women and Children's Hospital, Guangdong Medical University, Foshan, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China.', ""Maternal and Child Research Institute, Shunde Women and Children's Hospital, Guangdong Medical University, Foshan, China."", ""Maternal and Child Research Institute, Shunde Women and Children's Hospital, Guangdong Medical University, Foshan, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, China.']",['eng'],,['Systematic Review'],Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC7567015,,2020/11/03 06:00,2020/11/03 06:01,['2020/11/02 06:15'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/02 06:15 [entrez]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.00886 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Oct 2;11:886. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00886. eCollection 2020.,886,,20201002,['NOTNLM'],"['Asian population', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'meta-analysis', 'miR-146a', 'rs2910164']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the exponential dependencse of the size of the state space of these models on the number of nodes in the network can be a daunting prospect for attractor analysis of large-scale systems. We have previously proposed a network reduction technique for Boolean models and demonstrated its applicability on two biological systems, namely, the abscisic acid signal transduction network as well as the T-LGL leukemia survival signaling network. In this paper, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof that this method not only conserves the fixed points of a Boolean network, but also conserves the complex attractors of general asynchronous Boolean models wherein at each time step a randomly selected node is updated.

CYP7A1 expression undergoes tight regulation and is repressed after partial hepatectomy to prevent the accumulation of toxic bile acids. Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) is a hepatotrophic factor shown to support liver regeneration by augmenting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Nevertheless, less is known about ALR's role in protecting hepatocytes from bile acid accumulation and bile acid-induced apoptosis. Therefore, HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were incubated with recombinant human ALR (rALR) and the expression of CYP7A1, bile acid-induced apoptosis as well as potential molecular mechanisms were analyzed. We found that rALR reduces CYP7A1 expression by increasing nuclear NFkappaB levels. Moreover, rALR reduced glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced-apoptosis by decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, which is regulated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylation. Inhibitors for PI3K/Akt (GSK690693) and GSK3beta (SB415286) confirmed the specificity of rALR treatment for this pathway. In addition, rALR reduces pro-death signaling by decreasing GCDC-induced JNK phosphorylation. Taken all together, rALR might contribute to protecting hepatocytes from toxic concentrations of bile acids by down-regulating their denovo synthesis, attenuating apoptosis by activation of PI3K/Akt - GSK3beta pathway and inhibition of JNK signaling. Thereby this suggests a new role of ALR in augmenting the process of liver regeneration.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Notably, compound 7e exhibited a selective killing effect on K562/A02 cells by dose-dependently increasing the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus exerting a potential collateral sensitivity (CS)-promoting effect in vitro. Moreover, compound 7e could inhibit HDAC1 and HDAC6, and induce the apoptosis of K562/A02 cells by increasing the expression of Bax, decreasing Bcl-2 protein level, and promoting the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, respectively.

METHODS: Adults (N=470) from the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (CPMC) were randomized to a 2x2 experimental design to receive a hypothetical ""personalized"" genetic risk result for leukemia (relative risk = 1.5 or 2.5) through either the standard CPMC report (N = 232) or an enriched report informed by best practices (N = 238). A one-time, online survey assessed numeracy and risk perceptions including ""feelings of risk"" and a numerical estimate. RESULTS: Regardless of numeracy, participants who received the enriched report had fewer overestimates of their lifetime risk estimate (LRE; odds ratio = 0.19, p < .001) and lower feelings of risk on two of three measures (p < .001). Participants with higher numeracy scores had fewer overestimates of LRE (OR = 0.66, p < .001) and lower feelings of risk on two out of three measures (p </= .01); the interaction between numeracy and report format was non-significant. CONCLUSION: The enriched report produced more accurate LRE and lower risk perceptions regardless of numeracy level, suggesting the enriched format was helpful to individuals irrespective of numeracy ability.

High expression of MSI2 has been found to lead to the lower overall survival of patients with AML. This study proposed the potential antagonists of MSI2 RNA-recognition motifs (MSI2 RRM1) derived from the LC-MS analysis of three traditional herbal samples. The LC-MS analysis of the three traditional herbs concoctions yields a total of 271 unique molecules of which 262 were screened against MSI2 RRM1 protein. After the dynamic study of the selected 8 top molecules from the virtual screening, the five most promising ligands emerged as potential MSI2 antagonists compare to the reference experimental molecule. The results show that the dynamic of MSI2 RRM1 protein is accompanied by a rare even of protein chain dissociation and re-association as evident in both the bound and unbound state of the protein. The unbound protein experience earlier chain dissociation compare to ligand-bound protein indicating that ligand binding to the protein slows down the dissociation time but thereafter increases the frequency of alternation between the protein chain association and dissociation after the first experience. Interestingly, the re-association of the protein chain is also accompanied by full restoration of the ligands to the binding site. The drug candidate Methotrexate (M3) and rescinnamine (M9) are listed among the promising antagonist of MSI2 with unique properties compared to a less promising molecule Ergotamine (M6).Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The largest stereotyped subsets are #1, #2, #4 and #8, associated with specific clinicobiological characteristics and outcomes in retrospective studies. We assessed the associations and prognostic value of these BcR IG in prospective multicenter clinical trials reflective of two different clinical situations: i) early-stage patients (watch-and-wait arm of the CLL1 trial) (n=592); ii) patients in need of treatment, enrolled in 3 phase III trials (CLL8, CLL10, CLL11), treated with different chemo-immunotherapies (n=1861). Subset #1 was associated with del(11q), higher CLL international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) scores and similar clinical course to CLL with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes (U-CLL) in both early and advanced stage groups. IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) subset #2 cases had shorter time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) versus other M-CLL cases in the early-stage cohort (HR: 4.2, CI: 2-8.6, p<0.001), and shorter time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) in the advanced-stage cohort (HR: 2, CI: 1.2-3.3, p=0.005). M-CLL subset #4 was associated with lower CLL-IPI scores and younger age at diagnosis; in both cohorts, these patients showed a trend towards better outcomes versus other M-CLL. U-CLL subset #8 was associated with trisomy 12. Overall, this study shows that major stereotyped subsets have distinctive characteristics.

We previously reported that leukemia cells secrete growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15)which remodels the residual bone marrow (BM) adipocytes into small adipocytes and is associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, little is known about how GDF15 drives BM adipocyte remodeling. In this study, we examined the role of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels in the remodeling of BM adipocytes exposed to GDF15. We found that TRPV4 negatively regulated GDF15-induced remodeling of BM adipocytes. Furthermore, transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (TGFbetaRII) was identified as the main receptor for GDF15 on BM adipocytes. PI3K inhibitor treatment reduced GDF15-induced pAKT, identifying PI3K/AKT as the downstream stress response pathway. Subsequently, GDF15 reduced the expression of the transcription factor Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) in BM adipocytes subjected to RNA-seq screening and Western blot analyse. Moreover, it was also confirmed that FOXC1 combined with the TRPV4 promoter by the Chip-qPCR experiments, which suggests that FOXC1 mediates GDF15 regulation of TRPV4. In addition, an AML mouse model exhibited smaller BM adipocytes, whereas the TRPV4 activator 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD) partly rescued this process and increased survival. In conclusion, TRPV4 plays a critical role in BM adipocyte remodeling induced by leukemia cells, suggesting that targeting TRPV4 may constitute a novel strategy for AML therapy.",,"['Yang, Shaoxin', 'Lu, Wei', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Zhai, Yuanmei', 'Wei, Yanyu', 'Liu, Jiali', 'Yu, Yehua', 'Li, Zhiqiang', 'Shi, Jun']","['Yang S', 'Lu W', 'Zhao C', 'Zhai Y', 'Wei Y', 'Liu J', 'Yu Y', 'Li Z', 'Shi J']","[""Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, China."", ""Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, China."", ""Dept of.

Matching donor and recipient HLA alleles is considered optimal to reduce the risk of GVHD after HSCT but is not always possible. Only a limited number of studies have compared the influence of HLA disparities on HSCT outcomes for patients with JMML. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among 47 children with JMML who received related or unrelated unmanipulated HSCT (March 2010-October 2018). Among our participants, 27 (57.4%) donor-recipient pairs had 0-1 HLA disparities (Group 1: HLA-matched or </=1 allele/antigen mismatch donor) and 20 (42.6%) had >/=2 HLA disparities (Group 2: 2-3 mismatched/haploidentical donors). RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 26.0 months (range: 1-105 months), and the 5-year probabilities of DFS and RI for the whole cohort were 54.6 +/- 7.7% and 34.8 +/- 15.0%, respectively. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 patients had a significantly lower RI (5.3 +/- 10.5% vs 55.5 +/- 20.9%, P < .001), though similar rates of grade II-IV acute GVHD (60.0 +/- 22.4% vs 33.3 +/- 18.2%, P = .08), grade III-IV acute GVHD (25.0 +/- 19.5% vs 7.4 +/- 10.1%, P = .08), chronic GVHD (30.0 +/- 20.9% vs 34.9 +/- 18.8%, P = .85), NRM (20.0 +/- 18.0% vs 3.9 +/- 7.7%, P = .07), and DFS (74.4 +/- 9.9% vs 41.3 +/- 10.0%, P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: Disease relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure in JMML patients, especially in patients receiving HLA-matched and limited HLA-mismatched HSCT.

AIMS: This study sought to determine the influence of donor age on adult unrelated donor HCT outcome in Australia. METHODS: Patients were included in the study if they were aged 16 or above and underwent first allogeneic unrelated donor HCT in Australia for the indications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) between the years of 2001 and 2014 inclusive. The main outcome measure was overall survival (OS), which was tested against independent variables using univariate Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,158 unrelated donor HCT were represented in the data. Cumulative incidences of engraftment, transplant related mortality (TRM), acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), chronic GvHD and relapse were not significantly affected by donor age. OS probability at 5 years post-transplant was 48.3%. In multivariate analysis of OS, year of transplant 2001-2007, recipient age 40 years or greater, poor risk disease, HLA match less than 6/6 and poor performance status at transplant (Karnofsky scale) were independently significant adverse OS risk factors. Donor age was not a significant risk factor for OS in univariate or multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion from this study was that donor age (up to 59 years) did not influence post-transplant outcome among adult unrelated donor HCT performed in Australia for hematologic malignancies.

Prognostic factors for survival after allo-SCT have not been sufficiently defined: pheno-/genotype, patients age, conditioning regimens and remission at allo-SCT are under discussion. We analyzed the outcome of 180 consecutive adult ALL-patients undergoing allo-SCT at our center between 1995 and 2018 to identify specific prognostic factors. In our cohort 19% were older than 55 years, 28% had Philadelphia-positive B-ALL, 24% T-ALL. 54% were transplanted in first complete remission (CR1), 13% in CR2 after salvage therapy, 31% reached no remission (8% within first-line, 23% within salvage therapy). In 66% conditioning contained total body irradiation (TBI). With a median follow-up of 10 years, we observed an overall survival of 33% at 10 years, and a progression free survival of 31%. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 41% at 10 years, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality 28%.

Furthermore, lysine acetylation of many non-histone proteins is involved in key cellular processes including transcription, DNA damage repair, metabolism, cellular proliferation, mitosis, signal transduction, protein folding, and autophagy. Acetylation affects protein functions through multiple mechanisms including regulation of protein stability, enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, crosstalk with other post-translational modifications as well as regulation of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The paralogous lysine acetyltransferases KAT6A and KAT6B which belong to the MYST family of acetyltransferases, were first discovered approximately 25 years ago. KAT6 acetyltransferases acylate both histone H3 and non-histone proteins. In this respect, KAT6 acetyltransferases play key roles in regulation of transcription, various developmental processes, maintenance of hematopoietic and neural stem cells, regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation, cell cycle progression as well as mitosis. In the current review, we discuss the physiological functions of the acetyltransferases KAT6A and KAT6B as well as their functions under pathological conditions of aberrant expression, leading to several developmental syndromes and cancer. Importantly, both upregulation and downregulation of KAT6 proteins was shown to play a role in cancer formation, progression, and therapy resistance, suggesting that they can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We also describe reciprocal regulation of expression between KAT6 proteins and several microRNAs as well as their involvement in cancer formation, progression and resistance to therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

METHODS: An electronic search for observational studies on oral health outcomes in patients with leukemia was performed on Medline/PUBMED, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases up to April 2020. Dental caries and periodontal diseases were assessed using the following standardized parameters, respectively: mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT), and presence of marginal inflammation (gingivitis) or clinical attachment loss (periodontitis). Two independent reviewers conducted all phases of review. Included studies reporting similar outcomes were subjected to random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: From 1,246 retrieved references, 39 were included. Most studies were cross-sectional investigations involving young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nine studies presented high risk of bias and were not included on quantitative analyses. All studies in the meta-analysis (n=14) were conducted with children/teenagers with acute leukemia. Pooled gingivitis prevalence in patients before and during leukemia treatment was 85% (95%CI 75, 97%; 4 studies) and 82% (95%CI 71, 94%; 6 studies), respectively. Pooled DMFT means were 2.28 (95%CI 1.31, 3.25; 7 studies) and 3.65 (95%CI 1.45, 5.86; 5 studies) respectively for patients during and after leukemia treatment. Studies regarding periodontitis prevalence were too few to run a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on cross-sectional data, young people with acute leukemia have high prevalence of gingivitis and caries experience. These findings indicate that the effect of leukemia on oral health still needs to be better investigated.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We analysed VRE infections and mortality rates among VRE colonized patients with acute leukaemia, defined predisposing risk factors for infection and mortality, and investigated the influence of daptomycin or linezolid treatment on mortality. PATIENTS-METHODS: We included 200 VRE colonized adult acute leukaemia patients with febrile neutropenia between January 2010 and January 2016. Data were collected from electronic files. RESULTS: There were 179 patients in the colonized group, and 21 patients in the infected group. Enterococcus faecium (van A) was isolated from all patients. The infection rate was 10.5 %, and the types of infections noted were as follows: bloodstream (n = 14; 66.7 %), skin and soft tissue (n = 3; 14.3 %), urinary (n = 2; 9.5 %), and others (9.5 %). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, exposure to invasive procedures, coinfection status, and >15 days of VRE positivity were independent risk factors for VRE infections. In hospital mortality rates were 57.1 % in the infected group, and 9.5 % in the colonized group (p < 0.001). Older age, female gender, absolute neutropenia, and coinfection status were statistically significant predictor of survival. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in haematology patients with neutropenia. Clinicians should be aware of predisposing risk factors for VRE infection to avoid unfavourable outcomes.

There is reported interplay between IFN-gamma and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a kinase which has been implicated in both cell death and, conversely, cell survival. Thus, we utilized the CML-derived HAP1 cell line and a mutant HAP1 GSK-3beta knocked-down cell line (GSK-3beta 31bp) to investigate whether GSK-3 modulates IFN-gamma's action on CML cells. Significantly less GSK-3beta 31bp cells, relative to HAP1 cells, were present after 48h treatment with IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma treatment significantly decreased GSK-3beta 31bp substrate adhesiveness (relative to HAP1 cells); an observation often correlated with cell death. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that IFN-gamma induces a modest level of apoptosis in the HAP1 cells and that IFN-gamma induced apoptosis is significantly enhanced in GSK-3beta 31bp cells. Utilizing a complementary GSK-3beta knocked-down cell line (8bp) we found, via flow cytometric analysis, that IFN-gamma induced apoptosis is significantly enhanced in GSK-3beta 8bp cells relative to HAP1 cells.

Though ciPSCs have been derived in the presence of Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as well in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), the positioning of ciPSCs in the naive or the primed state of pluripotency remains elusive. This study aims to understand whether canine iPSCs belong to naive or prime state in comparison to mouse (m) iPSCs and human (h) iPSCs. MAIN METHODS: In the present study, we derived ciPSCs in presence of LIF and compared their state of pluripotency with that of miPSCs and hiPSCs by culturing them in the presence of LIF, bFGF, and LIF + bFGF. Gene expression level at transcript level was performed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR and at the protein level was analysed by immunofluorescence. We also attempted to understand the pluripotency state using lipid body analysis by bodipy staining and blue fluorescence emission. KEY FINDINGS: In contrast to miPSCs, the naive pluripotent stem cells, ciPSCs showed the expression of FGF5 similar to that of primed pluripotent stem cell, hiPSCs. Compared to miPSCs, ciPSCs cultured in presence of LIF showed enhanced expression of primed pluripotent marker FGF5, similar to hiPSCs cultured in presence of bFGF. Upon culturing in hiPSC culture condition, ciPSCs showed enhanced expression of core pluripotency genes compared to miPSCs cultured in similar condition. However, ciPSCs expressed naive pluripotent marker SSEA1 similar to miPSCs and lacked the expression of primed state marker SSEA4 unlike hiPSCs. Interestingly, for the first time, we demonstrate the ciPSC pluripotency using lipid body analysis wherein ciPSCs showed enhanced bodipy staining and blue fluorescence emission, reflecting the primed state of pluripotency. ciPSCs expressed higher levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme involved in the synthesis of palmitate, similar to that of hiPSCs and higher than that of miPSCs. As ciPSCs exhibit characteristic properties of both naive and primed pluripotent state, it probably represents a unique intermediary state of pluripotency that is distinct from that of mice and human pluripotent stem cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Elucidating the pluripotent state of ciPSCs assists in better understanding of the reprogramming events and development in different species. The study would provide a footprint of species-specific differences involved in reprogramming and the potential implication of iPSCs as a tool to analyse evolution.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Despite advances in treatment with chemotherapy, CRC remains a major cause of drug resistance-related cancer deaths. One of the main reasons for such resistance is dysregulation of Mcl-1 expression. In this study, we identified LZT-106 as a novel kinase inhibitor that was able to bind to CDK9 with potent inhibitory ability, and indirectly regulate the expression of Mcl-1. However, different regulatory profiles were observed between LZT-106 and the well-studied CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol with regards to Mcl-1 inhibition. Via Western blotting, real-time PCR and immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that LZT-106 was also able to target GSK-3beta signaling and facilitate the degradation of Mcl-1. And LZT-106 was shown to synergize with ABT-199 to induce apoptosis even in the RKO cell line that overexpressed Mcl-1. Finally, LZT-106 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model with minimal toxicity. Overall, our findings suggest that LZT-106 is a promising candidate drug for the treatment of patients with CRC.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether LM-Lipo, which were recently demonstrated to actively pass through inflamed endothelial layers, can penetrate into tumor spheroids, and to investigate the potential of LM-Lipo for use as an anticancer drug carrier. We prepared LM-Lipo via intermembrane protein transfer from human leukemia cells; transfer of leukocyte membrane proteins onto the liposomes was determined by Western blotting. LM-Lipo demonstrated a significantly high association with human lung cancer A549 cells compared with plain liposomes, which contributed to effective anti-proliferative action by encapsulated doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). Confocal microscopic images showed that LM-Lipo, but not plain liposomes, could efficiently penetrate into A549 tumor spheroids. Moreover, DOX-encapsulated LM-Lipo significantly suppressed tumor spheroid growth. Thus, leukocyte membrane proteins transferred onto LM-Lipo retained their unique function, which allowed for efficient penetration of the liposomes into tumor spheroids, similar to leukocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that LM-Lipo could be a useful tumor-penetrating drug delivery system for cancer treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Pharmacists Association(R).

Rheumatological manifestations are also described in such context. Herein, we report the observation of a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who developed systemic manifestations: polymyalgia rheumatica and pericarditis. CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old patient was referred for the exploration of two months history of inflammatory shoulder pain associated with biological inflammatory syndrome. He presented with asthenia, anorexia and loss of 5kg in one month. He had a three years follow-up for a CMML without any specific treatment. All of the explorations carried out showed a typical polymyalgia rheumatica. A pericardial effusion requiring emergency drainage was synchronously diagnosed. All the symptoms occurred during a worsening of his hematological disease. The rheumatological manifestation was favorable after a short corticosteroid therapy and pericarditis did not recur after 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: It should be necessary to screen patients for MDS in a context of systemic manifestation, especially in elderly patients with an abnormal blood count (cytopenia, macrocytosis and monocytosis).","['Copyright (c) 2020 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

In spite of satisfactory results of imatinib in the treatment of patients with CML, patients with treatment failure or suboptimal response developed resistance that might be because of pharmacogenetic variants. This study attempted to evaluate the influence of ABCB1 gene polymorphisms and smoking on CML risk and resistance to imatinib. Methods: ABCB1 (c.1236C>T, c.3435C>T) polymorphisms were genotyped in 98 CML patients and 100 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects by PCR-RFLP method, followed by sequencing. The patients were evaluated for cytogenetic response by the standard chromosome banding analysis in regular intervals. Results: Our results showed that c.1236CC genotype was significantly associated with imatinib resistance (OR = 3.94; p = 0.038). Analysis of the joint of single nucleotide polymorphism -smoking combination showed that smokers with c.1236TT/CT and c.1236CC genotypes had the increased risk of CML (OR = 6.04; p = 0.00 and OR = 4.95, p = 0.005) and treatment failure (OR = 5.36, p = 0.001 and OR = 15.7, p = 0.002), respectively. Smokers with c.3435TT/CT and c.3435CC genotypes also displayed the elevated risk of CML development (OR = 6.01, p = 0 and OR = 4.36, p = 0.011) and IM resistance (OR = 5.61, p = 0.001 and OR = 13.58, p = 0.002), respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that c.1236CC genotype has clinical importance in the prediction of treatment outcome with IM, and smoking could have a synergistic role in CML risk and IM resistance.",,"['Mohammadi, Fatemeh', 'Shafiei, Mohammad', 'Assad, Dlnya', 'Rostami, Golale', 'Hamid, Mohammad', 'Foroughmand, Ali Mohammad']","['Mohammadi F', 'Shafiei M', 'Assad D', 'Rostami G', 'Hamid M', 'Foroughmand AM']","['Department of Biology, School of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, School of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Biotechnology and Biological Science Research Center, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, Sulaimani University, Sulaymanyah, Iraq.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Biotechnology Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, School of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors', '*Smoking', 'Treatment Failure']",PMC7748114,,2020/11/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/11/01 03:49'],"['2020/11/01 03:49 [entrez]', '2020/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.29252/ibj.25.1.54 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2021 Jan;25(1):54-61. doi: 10.29252/ibj.25.1.54.

ALV-K as a newly found subgroup in recent years, which made the control and eradication of ALV more difficult as they were originated from the recombination of different subgroups. To date, specific rapid detection methods refer to ALV-K are still missing. Gp85 is the main structural protein of the virus, which mediates the invasion of host cells by the virus and determinates the classification of subgroups. In this study, we prepared a monoclonal antibody (Mab) named Km3 against Gp85 of ALV-K. Immuno fl uorescence assay showed that Km3 specifically recognized the strains of ALV-K rather than the strains of ALV-A or ALV-J. To explain the subgroups specificity of Km3, the epitope cognized by the Mab was identi fi ed by Western blotting using 15 overlapping fragments spanning the Gp85. Finally, the peptide (129)AFGPRSIDTLSDWSRPQ(145) was identified as the minimal linear epitope recognized by Km3. Alignment of Gp85 from different subgroups showed that the epitope was highly conserved among ALV-K strains, which was quite different from that of the strains from ALV -A, -B and -J. In conclusion, the Mab Km3 may serve as a useful reagent for ALV-K detection and diagnosis in the future.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) is expressed in the leukemic cells of smoldering/chronic ATL patients, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and spontaneous proliferation. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway also plays a critical role in ATL cell survival and proliferation. We previously performed a high-throughput screen that demonstrated additive/synergistic activity of Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with AZD8055, an mTORC1/C2 inhibitor. However, effects of unintended JAK2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib limits it therapeutic potential for ATL patients, which lead us to evaluate a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Here, we demonstrated that Upadacitinib, a JAK-1 inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and the expression of p-STAT5. Combinations of Upadacitinib with either AZD8055 or Sapanisertib, mTORC1/C2 inhibitors, showed anti-proliferative effects against cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and synergistic effect with reducing tumor growth in NSG mice bearing IL-2 transgenic tumors. Importantly, the combination of these two agents inhibited ex vivo spontaneous proliferation of ATL cells from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL. Combined targeting of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways represents a promising therapeutic intervention for patients with smoldering/chronic ATL.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Daenthanasanmak, Anusara', 'Lin, Yuquan', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Bryant, Bonita R', 'Petrus, Michael N', 'Bamford, Richard N', 'Thomas, Craig J', 'Miljkovic, Milos D', 'Conlon, Kevin C', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Daenthanasanmak A', 'Lin Y', 'Zhang M', 'Bryant BR', 'Petrus MN', 'Bamford RN', 'Thomas CJ', 'Miljkovic MD', 'Conlon KC', 'Waldmann TA']","['Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Transponics, Essex Junction, VT 05452, USA.', 'Division of Preclinical Innovation, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1374, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

METHOD: Participants were adult allogeneic HSCT recipients who had undergone the procedure for acute leukaemia or other haematological malignancy between the years 2000-2012 in Sydney, Australia. They completed a purpose designed survey and six other validated instruments which assessed FCR, psychological functioning, quality of life, demographic, social and clinical variables. RESULTS: Of the 364 respondents, approximately 11% of the sample lived with severe FCR while only 5% of subjects reported having no FCR. Variables significantly associated with higher FCR included unemployment, a shorter time (years) post-transplant, not attending to health screening (PAP smear), a secondary diagnosis of skin cancer, younger age, referral to a psychiatrist and taking psychotropic medication. Higher psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress) and lower quality of life made a significant contribution to the prediction of FCR. CONCLUSIONS: Post HSCT follow-up care should include an assessment and discussion regarding FCR to balance both realistic and unrealistic cancer recurrence risks. Managing FCR is one of the most ubiquitous unmet needs of survivors of haematological disease and it is important that HSCT nurses are both aware of the fear, and are equipped with knowledge on how to help patients navigate it with realistic expectations.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Combining population-based data from Finnish Medical Birth Registry (MBR) and Finnish Cancer Registry, we identified a total of 2029 patients diagnosed with cancer under the age of 20 years and 10 103 age- and sex-matched controls over the years 1996 to 2014. Information on the prenatal and perinatal conditions was obtained from the MBR. Gestational age was categorized into early (<32) and late preterm (32-36) and term (>/=37 weeks). Cancer risk among the preterm compared to term neonates was evaluated using conditional logistic regression. We identified 141 cancers among the preterm (20.8% of 678) vs 1888 cancers in the term children (16.5% of 11 454). The risk of any cancer was increased for the preterm (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.57), especially for the early preterm (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.16-2.92).

Germ cell tumors were diagnosed at a significantly younger age among the preterm. Neonatal therapies, for example, mechanical ventilation, were associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer independent of gestational age. Preterm, especially early preterm birth, is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer, especially germ cell tumors and AML.

Here in this study, we further demonstrated that HMGB1 presents higher expression in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients compared with the normal controls and contributes to the AML pathogenesis and progression by inhibiting apoptosis, facilitating proliferation, and inducing myeloid differentiation blockade of AML cells. Mechanistic investigation revealed that transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) acts as a potential downstream target of HMGB1 and lentivirus-mediated knockdown of TGFBI expression impaired phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced myeloid differentiation of AML cell lines. On the other hand, chidamide, an orally histone deacetylase inhibitor, decreases HMGB1 expression significantly in AML cells with concomitant upregulation of TGFBI expression, and confers therapeutic effect on AML by inducing cell differentiation, apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. In conclusion, our findings provide additional insights that HMGB1 is a promising therapeutic target of AML, and also present experimental evidence for the clinical application of chidamide as a novel agent in AML therapy by downregulating HMGB1 expression.

This is a case report of a 75-year-old patient initially reporting multiple bone pains that were attributed to osteolytic ATL. The patient developed spontaneous chest/back pain and visited a local hospital. Laboratory tests showed high levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and computed tomography (CT) revealed skeletal lesions with osteolysis. Although multiple myeloma was initially suspected, the results of bone marrow aspiration and bone biopsy were inconsistent. After he was referred to our hospital, mild hypercalcemia (10.4 mg/dL) with low-normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) (27 pg/mL), low parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), and elevated 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25OH2D) levels (136 pg/mL) narrowed the differential diagnosis down to lymphomatous and granulomatous diseases, and then, the high serum soluble IL-2 receptor (3,450 U/mL) and the flower cells recognized in the peripheral blood sample suggested the involvement of ATL. Finally, the reevaluation of the iliac bone biopsy sample led us to the histological diagnosis of ATL infiltration in the bone. The subsequent two courses of chemotherapy in addition to denosumab resulted in an objective partial metabolic response indicated in 18-fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT).

NDRG2, as a stress-responsive protein, is induced by several stress-related signaling pathways and NDRG2 negatively regulates various signal transduction pathways. Although it has not been found to function alone, NDRG2 binds serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), generating a complex that is involved in the regulation of various target proteins. The main function of NDRG2 is to maintain cell homeostasis by suppressing stress-induced signal transduction; however, in cancer, genomic deletions and/or promoter methylation may inhibit the expression of NDRG2, resulting in enhanced tumor development through overactivated signal transduction pathways. A wide variety of tumors develop in Ndrg2-deficient mice, including T-cell lymphoma, liver, lung and other tumors, the characteristics of which are similar to those in Pten-deficient mice. In particular, PTEN is a target molecule of the NDRG2/PP2A complex, which enhances PTEN phosphatase activity by dephosphorylating residues in the PTEN C-terminal region. In ATLL cells, loss of NDRG2 expression leads to the failed recruitment of PP2A to PTEN, resulting in the inactivation of PTEN phosphatase with phosphorylation, ultimately leading to the activation of PI3K/AKT. Thus, NDRG2, as a PP2A adaptor, regulates the global phosphorylation of important signaling molecules. Moreover, the downregulation of NDRG2 expression by long-term stress-induced methylation is directly correlated with the development of ATLL and other cancers. Thus, NDRG2 might be important for the development of stress-induced leukemia and other cancers and has become an important target for novel molecular therapies.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

However, only a few reports have analyzed urinary electrolytes in this context. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 55 patients with ALL who underwent chemotherapy between October 2007 and January 2019. Their median age was 9.3 years (range, 0.3-24.0 years) with 30 males and 25 females. Lineages were B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) in 42 patients, T-cell in nine and others in four patients. All patients received chemotherapy based on the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster regimen. RESULTS: Forty-nine out of the 55 ALL patients exhibited hypercalciuria at least once during chemotherapy. Moreover, 36 patients with BCP-ALL, who were receiving identical Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-based regimens, exhibited significantly high urinary calcium excretion immediately following high-dose glucocorticoid administration. Among the 55 ALL patients, urolithiasis was observed in one patient, a 6-year-old boy with BCP-ALL who developed urolithiasis at reinduction chemotherapy just after cessation of high-dose dexamethasone administration.

Whether preemptive recombinant interleukin-2 (pre-IL2) is effective for patients with late-onset MRD (LMRD) remains unknown. We retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety of pre-IL2 (n = 30) and pre-DLI (n = 25) for LMRD in patients receiving allo-HSCT for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The 1-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 86.7% and 78.4% (P = 0.267), 83.3% and 75.6% (P = 0.329), the cumulative incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) at 100 days post-preemptive intervention was 3.3% and 12.0% (P = 0.226) in the pre-IL2 group and pre-DLI group, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 7.7% and 27.9% (P = 0.018), 13.6% and 20.0% (P = 0.561) and 3.3% and 5.5% (P = 0.321) in the two groups, respectively. No remarkable differences in CIR, OS, and DFS between the two intervention groups were found in multivariate analysis.

In conclusion, preemptive low-dose IL2 and preemptive DLI yield comparable outcomes for patients with LMRD receiving allo-HSCT, in terms of aGVHD, NRM, relapse, OS, and DFS. However, preemptive low-dose IL2 has a lower incidence of moderate/severe cGVHD and a higher CRFS.

As a heavily visual discipline, pathology has been able to leverage social media platforms for trainee education, curbside and official consultations, interdisciplinary communication, and interactions among medical professionals and patient education. The pathology community has been at the forefront of using social media as an educational forum, and the hematopathology community has emerged as one of the strongest and most influential presences on these online platforms. In this review, we perform an in-depth analysis of various Twitter metrics to demonstrate key trends in the usage of social media as it pertains to hematopathology using the hashtag #Hemepath and we describe specific details on how hematopathologists have managed to take advantage of Twitter in furthering our mission of advancing medical education and disseminating knowledge using these innovative virtual educational experiences. RECENT FINDINGS: The hematopathology community has a great degree of enthusiasm among residents, fellows, and faculty in sharing educational material using case-based examples, participating in group-based online activities, introducing new publications by article authors or readership, and disseminating educational ""pearls"" from medical conferences, using hashtags and digital images that otherwise would not be readily available to many around the globe. This practice is helping reshape the structure of our field and is providing opportunities to optimize the educational experience by enhancing the instant exposure to cutting-edge information and expert opinions, among other valuable features.

Since then, several cases have been reported in patients treated with low-dose MTX for inflammatory diseases. METHODS: A systematic research of cases of MTX-related osteopathy was performed in records of Rheumatology Department of Rennes University Hospital. Data collection focused on demographic data, corticosteroid doses, MTX doses and intake method, cumulative doses, year of diagnosis, fracture location, bone densitometry value, and osteoporosis treatment if necessary. A literature review was also conducted to identify other cases in literature and try to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of this rare entity. RESULTS: We report 5 cases identified between 2011 and 2019, which represents the largest cohort described excluding oncology cases. Fracture locations were atypical for osteoporotic fractures. All patients improved in the following months with MTX withdrawal. All patients except one were treated with antiresorptives (bisphosphonates, denosumab). Two patients, treated with bisphosphonates, had a recurrence of fracture, once again of atypical location. Twenty-five cases were collected in literature with similar clinical presentation. The cellular studies that investigated the bone toxicity of MTX mainly showed a decrease in the number of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes in the growth plate and an increase in the number and activity of osteoclasts. In vitro, consequences of mechanical stimulation on human trabecular bone cells in the presence of MTX showed an alteration in mechano-transduction, with membrane hyperpolarization, acting on the integrin pathway. In contrast with our report, the cases described in the literature were not consistently associated with a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). CONCLUSION: MTX osteopathy while rare must be known by the rheumatologist, especially when using this treatment for inflammatory conditions. The mechanisms are still poorly understood, raising the question of a possible remnant effect of MTX on osteo-forming bone cells, potentially dose-dependent. Methotrexate (MTX) osteopathy, described as a clinical triad, pain, osteoporosis, and atypical stress fractures, while rare, must be known by the rheumatologist. Our cohort of 5 cases represent the largest series of the literature. Pathophysiological studies raised the question of a dose-dependent remnant effect of MTX on osteo-forming bone cells.",,"['Robin, F', 'Cadiou, S', 'Albert, J-D', 'Bart, G', 'Coiffier, G', 'Guggenbuhl, P']","['Robin F', 'Cadiou S', 'Albert JD', 'Bart G', 'Coiffier G', 'Guggenbuhl P']","['INSERM, Rennes University Hospital, UMR 1241, Institut NuMeCan (Nutrition Metabolisms and Cancer), University Rennes, Rennes, France. francois.robin@chu-rennes.fr.', 'Rheumatology department, Rennes University Hospital, 16 Boulevard de Bulgarie, 35200, Rennes, France. francois.robin@chu-rennes.fr.', 'Rheumatology department, Rennes University Hospital, 16 Boulevard de Bulgarie, 35200, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM, Rennes University Hospital, UMR 1241, Institut NuMeCan (Nutrition Metabolisms and Cancer), University Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Rheumatology department, Rennes University Hospital, 16 Boulevard de Bulgarie, 35200, Rennes, France.', 'Rheumatology department, Rennes University Hospital, 16 Boulevard de Bulgarie, 35200, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM, Rennes University Hospital, UMR 1241, Institut NuMeCan (Nutrition Metabolisms and Cancer), University Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Rheumatology department, Rennes University Hospital, 16 Boulevard de Bulgarie, 35200, Rennes, France.', 'INSERM, Rennes University Hospital, UMR 1241, Institut NuMeCan (Nutrition Metabolisms and Cancer), University Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Rheumatology department, Rennes University Hospital, 16 Boulevard de Bulgarie, 35200, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Osteoporos Int,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,9100105,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['*Antirheumatic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Bone Density', '*Bone Diseases', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', '*Osteoporosis/chemically induced/drug therapy']",,,2020/11/01 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2020/10/31 05:35'],"['2020/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/31 05:35 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00198-020-05664-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00198-020-05664-x [pii]']",ppublish,Osteoporos Int. 2021 Feb;32(2):225-232. doi: 10.1007/s00198-020-05664-x.

Donor sources were matched sibling donor (MSD; n = 199), matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 110), 1-allele-mismatched unrelated donor (1-MMUD; n = 83), and cord blood (CB; n = 48). Cumulative incidence of severe chronic GVHD was 14.8% for MSD-HCT, 30.1% for MUD-HCT, 9.6% for 1-MMUD-HCT, and 4.2% for CBT, respectively (P < 0.001), while no difference was observed in grade III-IV acute GVHD. After a median follow-up of 58.1 months, cumulative incidence of relapse was 26.1% for MSD-HCT, 27.2% for MUD-HCT, 31.2% for 1-MMUD-HCT, and 7.2% for CBT, respectively (P = 0.042). Disease-free survival and overall survival were comparable among all donor sources. However, GRFS for MSD-HCT, MUD-HCT, 1-MMUD-HCT, and CBT was 33.1%, 14.5%, 42.1%, and 50.3%, respectively (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, CBT showed a comparable GRFS to MSD-HCT (HR, 0.78; P = 0.290), while MUD-HCT was associated with a poorer GRFS (HR, 1.53; P = 0.002).

While exon 2 skipping alternatively spliced variant of AIMP2 (AIMP2-DX2) compromises AIMP2 activity and is associated with carcinogenesis, its clinical potential awaits further validation. Here, we found that AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio is strongly correlated with major cancer signaling pathways and poor prognosis, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Analysis of a clinical patient cohort revealed that AIMP2-DX2 positive AML patients show decreased overall survival and progression-free survival. We also developed targeted RNA-sequencing and single-molecule RNA-FISH tools to quantitatively analyze AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 ratios at the single-cell level. By subclassifying hematologic cancer cells based on their AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 ratios, we found that downregulating AIMP2-DX2 sensitizes cells to anticancer drugs only for a subgroup of cells while it has adverse effects on others.

In recent years, there has been a significant shift toward the use of novel and effective, target-directed therapies, including inhibitors of mutant FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), the B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax, and the hedgehog pathway inhibitor glasdegib. In older patients the combination of a hypomethylating agent or low-dose cytarabine, venetoclax achieved composite response rates that approximate those seen with standard induction regimens in similar populations, but with potentially less toxicity and early mortality. Preclinical data suggest synergy between venetoclax and FLT3- and IDH-targeted therapies, and doublets of venetoclax with inhibitors targeting these mutations have shown promising clinical activity in early stage trials.

However, the ability to dissect these evolving, heterogeneous interactions among distinct B-ALL subtypes and their varying BM niches is limited with current in vivo methods. Here, we demonstrated an in vitro organotypic ""leukemia-on-a-chip"" model to emulate the in vivo B-ALL BM pathology and comparatively studied the spatial and genetic heterogeneity of the BM niche in regulating B-ALL chemotherapy resistance. We revealed the heterogeneous chemoresistance mechanisms across various B-ALL cell lines and patient-derived samples. We showed that the leukemic perivascular, endosteal, and hematopoietic niche-derived factors maintain B-ALL survival and quiescence (e.g., CXCL12 cytokine signal, VCAM-1/OPN adhesive signals, and enhanced downstream leukemia-intrinsic NF-kappaB pathway). Furthermore, we demonstrated the preclinical use of our model to test niche-cotargeting regimens, which may translate to patient-specific therapy screening and response prediction.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

At present, the underlying mechanisms of LH in gastric cancer remain unclear. MCL1, an anti-apoptotic protein of BCL2 family, is closely related to drug resistance of tumor. Therefore, MCL1 is considered as a potential target for cancer treatment. METHODS: The effect of LH on gastric cancer was assessed in vitro (by MTT, BrdU, western blotting...) and in vivo (by immunohistochemistry). RESULTS: In this study, we showed that LH has an anti-tumorous effect by down-regulating MCL1 in gastric cancer. Besides, we unveiled that LH reduced the protein stability of MCL1 by up-regulating ubiquitin E3 ligase FBXW7, arrested cell cycle at S phase and triggered apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Meanwhile, we also demonstrated that LH could induce apoptosis of the BCL2-drug-resistant-cell-lines. Moreover, PDX (Patient-Derived tumor xenograft) model experiment proved that LH combined with HA14-1 (inhibitor of BCL2), had a more significant therapeutic effect on gastric cancer.

This pathogen spreads easily without detection by farmers and veterinarians due to the lack of obvious clinical signs. Cattle movement strongly contributes to the inter-farm transmission of BLV. This study quantified the farm-level risk of BLV introduction using a cattle movement analysis. A generalized linear mixed model predicting the proportion of BLV-infected cattle was constructed based on weighted in-degree centrality. Our results suggest a positive association between weighted in-degree centrality and the estimated number of introduced BLV-infected cattle. Remarkably, the introduction of approximately six cattle allowed at least one BLV-infected animal to be added to the farm in the worst-case scenario. These data suggest a high risk of BLV infection on farms with a high number of cattle being introduced.

As a result of stochastic genetic and epigenetic alterations, the appearance of a branched evolutionary shape confers tumor plasticity, causing relapse and unfavorable clinical prognosis. The growing evidence in cancer discovery presents to us ""the great paradox"" consisting of countless potential targets constantly discovered and a small number of candidates being effective in human patients. Among these, cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has been proposed as proto-oncogene supporting tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Overexpression and hyperactivation of CREB are frequently observed in cancer, whereas genetic and pharmacological CREB downregulation affects proliferation and apoptosis. Notably, the present review is designed to investigate the feasibility of targeting CREB in cancer therapy. In particular, starting with the latest CREB evidence in cancer pathophysiology, we evaluate the advancement state of CREB inhibitor design, including the histone lysine demethylases JMJD3/UTX inhibitor GSKJ4 that we newly identified as a promising CREB modulator in leukemia cells. Moreover, an accurate analysis of strengths and weaknesses is also conducted to figure out whether CREB can actually represent a therapeutic candidate or just one of the innumerable preclinical cancer targets.",,"['Sapio, Luigi', 'Salzillo, Alessia', 'Ragone, Angela', 'Illiano, Michela', 'Spina, Annamaria', 'Naviglio, Silvio']","['Sapio L', 'Salzillo A', 'Ragone A', 'Illiano M', 'Spina A', 'Naviglio S']","['Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Via L.

The best characterized pathogenic splice isoforms, Ik-6 and Ik-8, have been commonly found in BCR-ABL1+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and a subset of BCR-ABL1-like ALL. Infantile and childhood ALL that express these pathogenic IKZF1 isoforms have shown inferior clinical outcomes and can be resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using ALL cell lines, we designed and validated a method to detect abnormal IKZF1 transcripts. In the SUP-B15 leukemia cell line, we noted novel IKZF1 transcripts that include both an Ik-6 splice and a transcript with a 14 base pair insertion at the C-terminus. There was also increased IKZF2 protein in SUP-B15 as compared to other ALL lines. Expression of Ik-6 could be suppressed by treatment with the pro-apoptotic type II histone deacetylase inhibitor givinostat. In 17 adult ALL samples, we noted the Ik-6 isoforms in 6 of 15 BCR-ABL1(-), and 1 of 2 BCR-ABL1(+) cases, with Ik-8 also expressed in one case.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old man had multiple lymph nodes in the neck, and the lymph nodes on the right side adhered to the surrounding tissues. His lymphocytes ratio in blood was up to 86.3%. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate showed positive results for CD2, CD5, CD7, cCD3, TDT, CD4, CD8, and CD10, negative results for CD34, CD117, CD33, HLA-DR, CD19, and CD20. Twenty six months later, the patient felt pain in the neck and shoulder after touching. His lymphocytes of blood were 109.9x109 /L. 43 fusion genes and positive BCR/ABL was detected. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate showed pro B lymphocytes accounted for 85.54%, and positive expression of CD38, CD10, CD34, CD33, TDT, CD9, and HLA-DR.

Twenty six months later, we discovered the patient was diagnosed with B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia. INTERVENTIONS: Systemic chemotherapy is first given when a patient was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After the patient happened linage switch, we adjusted the treatment plan, and the patient was complete remission after 1 course of treatment. OUTCOMES: Our case provides information of lineage switch from T-ALL to B-ALL in this report, which is never seen in our knowledge. LESSONS: This lineage switch from T-ALL to B-ALL is never reported beforemoreover, the RT-PCR data showed the patient expressed high level of T cell and B cell development transcription factors.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have shown their important regulatory roles in AML progression. Here, we intended to disclose the role of circular RNA protein tyrosine kinase 2 (circ-PTK2) in the progression of AML and illustrate the potential working mechanisms. METHODS: 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and colony formation assay were conducted to analyze cell proliferation ability, and the apoptosis rate was assessed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the direct interaction between microRNA-330-5p (miR-330-5p) and circ-PTK2 or forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). RESULTS: Circ-PTK2 was highly expressed in AML. Circ-PTK2 interference suppressed the proliferation and triggered the apoptosis of AML cells. Circ-PTK2 directly bound to miR-330-5p. Si-circ-PTK2-mediated inhibition on the malignant behaviors of AML cells was partly counteracted by the addition of anti-miR-330-5p. MiR-330-5p directly interacted with FOXM1 messenger RNA (mRNA), and FOXM1 overexpression partly reversed miR-330-5p-induced influence in AML cells. Circ-PTK2 up-regulated FOXM1 expression through sponging miR-330-5p in AML cells. CONCLUSION: Circ-PTK2 promoted the proliferation and hampered the apoptosis of AML cells through targeting miR-330-5p/FOXM1 axis.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The association between histiocytoses of the cutaneous-group and myeloid malignancies is a poorly investigated topic of high biological and clinical impact. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the scientific literature, compliant with PRISMA guidelines, to unravel the clinical and pathological features of this intriguing association. FINDINGS: We gathered and analysed 102 patients. Most were children with generalised cutaneous eruptions and displayed risk organ involvement (i.e. bone marrow, spleen, liver). Interestingly, all these features are uncommonly encountered in C-group histiocytosis not associated with haematological neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that generalised eruptions and risk organ involvement in cutaneous-group histiocytosis should raise a suspicion for a concomitant myeloid neoplasm both in children and in adults and warrant further investigations. A rapid recognition of this association is required to start a prompt and effective therapeutic management given the aggressive behaviour of the associated myeloid neoplasm in most instances.",['(c) 2020 The Australasian College of Dermatologists.'],"['Bonometti, Arturo', 'Gliozzo, Jessica', 'Moltrasio, Chiara', 'Bagnoli, Filippo', 'Berti, Emilio']","['Bonometti A', 'Gliozzo J', 'Moltrasio C', 'Bagnoli F', 'Berti E']","['Unit of Anatomic Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, IRCCS San Matteo Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Unit of Neuroradiology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Pathophysiology and Organ Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",Australia,Australas J Dermatol,The Australasian journal of dermatology,0135232,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Histiocytosis/*complications', 'Humans', 'Skin Diseases/*complications']",,,2020/10/31 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/30 17:15'],"['2020/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/30 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajd.13491 [doi]'],ppublish,Australas J Dermatol. 2021 May;62(2):e162-e169. doi: 10.1111/ajd.13491.

The main result is that perturbing two parameters of a two-state simplification of this model captures the essence of two A-bomb survivor mysteries: (1) in those exposed to > 1 Sv in Hiroshima, four of six female onsets arose as a cluster in 1969-1974, well after 5-10-year latencies expected and observed in two of six female- and nine of ten male cases (about one background case was expected in this high-dose cohort); and (2) no Nagasaki adult cases exposed to > 0.2 Sv were observed though about nine were expected (~ 1.5 background + ~ 7.5 radiation-induced). Overall, it is concluded that: (1) whole-body radiation co-creates malignant and benign BCR-ABL clones; (2) benign clones are more likely to act as anti-CML vaccines in females than in males; (3) the Hong Kong flu of 1968 (and H3N2 seasonal flu thereafter) exhausted anti-CML immunity, thereby releasing radiation-induced clones latent in high-dose Hiroshima females; and (4) benign cells of 1-2 are CD4(+) as human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-1 endemic to Nagasaki but not Hiroshima expands numbers of such cells.

Hemato-oncological patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, requiring decisive recommendations on treatment and triage. The aim of this survey amongst experts on radiation therapy (RT) for lymphoma and leukemia is to delineate typical clinical scenarios and to provide counsel for high-quality care. METHODS: A multi-item questionnaire containing multiple-choice and free-text questions was developed in a peer-reviewed process and sent to members of the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance. Answers were assessed online and analyzed centrally. RESULTS: Omission of RT was only considered in a minority of cases if alternative treatment options were available. Hypofractionated regimens and reduced dosages may be used for indolent lymphoma and fractures due to multiple myeloma. Overall, there was a tendency to shorten RT rather than to postpone or omit it. Even in case of critical resource shortage, panelists agreed to start emergency RT for typical indications (intracranial pressure, spinal compression, superior vena cava syndrome) within 24h. Possible criteria to consider for patient triage are the availability of (systemic) options, the underlying disease dynamic, and the treatment rationale (curative/palliative). CONCLUSION: RT for hemato-oncological patients receives high-priority and should be maintained even in later stages of the pandemic. Hypofractionation and shortened treatment schedules are feasible options for well-defined constellations, but have to be discussed in the clinical context.",,"['Oertel, M', 'Elsayad, K', 'Engenhart-Cabillic, R', 'Reinartz, G', 'Baues, C', 'Schmidberger, H', 'Vordermark, D', 'Marnitz, S', 'Lukas, P', 'Ruebe, C', 'Engert, A', 'Lenz, G', 'Eich, H T']","['Oertel M', 'Elsayad K', 'Engenhart-Cabillic R', 'Reinartz G', 'Baues C', 'Schmidberger H', 'Vordermark D', 'Marnitz S', 'Lukas P', 'Ruebe C', 'Engert A', 'Lenz G', 'Eich HT']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1 building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1 building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Giessen-Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1 building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and Cyberknife Center, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and Cyberknife Center, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Radiooncology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Saarland University Hospital, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1 building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany. hans.eich@ukmuenster.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Objective: To examine the association between diet quality and overall survival among individuals with metastatic colorectal cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective cohort study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance) and Southwest Oncology Group 80405 trial between October 27, 2005, and February 29, 2012, and followed up through January 2018. Exposures: Participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire within 4 weeks after initiation of first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Diets were categorized according to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED) score, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and Western and prudent dietary patterns derived using principal component analysis. Participants were categorized into sex-specific quintiles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for overall survival. Results: In this cohort study of 1284 individuals with metastatic colorectal cancer, the median age was 59 (interquartile range [IQR]: 51-68) years, median body mass index was 27.2 (IQR, 24.1-31.4), 521 (41%) were female, and 1102 (86%) were White. There were 1100 deaths during a median follow-up of 73 months (IQR, 64-87 months). We observed an inverse association between the AMED score and risk of death (HR quintile 5 vs quintile 1, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.04; P = .04 for trend), but the point estimates were not statistically significant.

Population-based studies from Sweden and US SEER data have shown long-term survival rates of 62% and 65.7%, with the lower rate being from a higher percentage of early deaths. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter trial, we developed a simplified algorithm that focused on prevention and early treatment of the three main causes of death: bleeding, differentiation syndrome, and infection. All patients with a diagnosis of APL were included. The initial 6 months were spent educating oncologists about early deaths in APL. At the time of suspicion of an APL, an expert was contacted. The algorithm was made available followed by discussion of the treatment plan. Communication between expert and treating physician was frequent in the first 2 weeks, during which time most deaths take place. RESULTS: Between September 2013 and April 2016, 120 patients enrolled in the study from 32 hospitals. The median age was 52.5 years, with 39% > 60 years and 25% with an age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index > 4. Sixty-three percent of patients were managed at community centers. Two patients did not meet the criteria for analysis, and of 118 evaluable patients, 10 died, with an early mortality rate of 8.5%. With a median follow-up of 27.3 months, the overall survival was 84.5%. CONCLUSION: Induction mortality can be decreased and population-wide survival improved in APL with the use of standardized treatment guidelines. Support from experts who have more experience with induction therapy is crucial and helps to improve the outcomes.",,"['Jillella, Anand P', 'Arellano, Martha L', 'Gaddh, Manila', 'Langston, Amy A', 'Heffner, Leonard T', 'Winton, Elliott F', 'McLemore, Morgan L', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Caprara, Catherine R', 'Simon, Kathryn S', 'Bolds, Sheldon L', 'DeBragga, Stephanie', 'Karkhanis, Prachi', 'Krishnamurthy, Shruthi H', 'Tongol, Jose', 'El Geneidy, Mohamed M', 'Pati, Asim', 'Gerber, Jonathan M', 'Grunwald, Michael R', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Stuart, Robert K', 'Kota, Vamsi K']","['Jillella AP', 'Arellano ML', 'Gaddh M', 'Langston AA', 'Heffner LT', 'Winton EF', 'McLemore ML', 'Zhang C', 'Caprara CR', 'Simon KS', 'Bolds SL', 'DeBragga S', 'Karkhanis P', 'Krishnamurthy SH', 'Tongol J', 'El Geneidy MM', 'Pati A', 'Gerber JM', 'Grunwald MR', 'Cortes J', 'Bashey A', 'Stuart RK', 'Kota VK']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Phoebe Putney Cancer Center, Albany, GA.', 'South Carolina Oncology Associates, Columbia, SC.', 'Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute, Spartanburg, SC.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute of Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, The Levine Cancer Institute of Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, GA.', 'Blood & Marrow Transplant, Cellular Immunotherapy & Acute Leukemia Program at Northside Hospital and Blood and Marrow Transplant Group of Georgia, Atlanta, GA.', 'Hollings Cancer Institute at Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, GA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,,IM,"['Hemorrhage', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sweden', 'Universities']",PMC8202058,"['Conflicts of Interest Statement:Accepted on September 22, 2020.

However, definite prognostic value of SNHG12 remains unclear. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between SNHG12 expression level and cancer prognosis. A literature retrieval was conducted by searching kinds of databases. The meta-analysis was performed by using Revman 5.2 and Stata 12.0 software. Besides, The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was analyzed to validate the results in our meta-analysis via using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. The pooled results showed that high SNHG12 expression significantly indicated worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Tumor type, sample size, survival analysis method, and cutoff value did not alter SNHG12 prognosis value according to stratified analysis results. Additionally, higher expression of SNHG12 suggested unfavorable clinicopathological outcomes including larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stage. Online cross-validation in TCGA dataset further indicated that cancer patients with upregulated SNHG12 expression had worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Therefore, elevated SNHG12 expression was associated with poor survival and unfavorable clinical outcomes in various cancers, and therefore might be a potential prognostic biomarker in human cancers.

Sinusitis and allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis are the two major diseases caused by S. commune. Although there have been several reports of invasive fungal diseases, most of them were invasive sinusitis. We present a case of invasive fungal pneumonia due to S. commune, developed in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia presenting neutropenic fever. The diagnosis was made by characteristic macroscopic and microscopic findings of fungal isolate and was confirmed via sequencing of internal transcribed spacer region. The patient was improved after 8 weeks of antifungal therapy based on the susceptibility result. We propose that S. commune should be considered as an emerging pathogen of invasive fungal pneumonia when a patient is under immunocompromised state. We also reviewed global literatures focused on the invasive fungal diseases caused by S. commune.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Korean Society', 'for Antimicrobial Therapy, and The Korean Society for AIDS.']","['Kim, Hahn', 'Yi, Yunmi', 'Cho, Sung Yeon', 'Lee, Dong Gun', 'Chun, Hye Sun', 'Park, Chulmin', 'Kim, Yoo Jin', 'Park, Yeon Joon']","['Kim H', 'Yi Y', 'Cho SY', 'Lee DG', 'Chun HS', 'Park C', 'Kim YJ', 'Park YJ']","['Catholic Medical Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. cho.sy@catholic.ac.kr.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Korea (South),Infect Chemother,Infection & chemotherapy,101531537,,,,,,2020/10/31 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2020/10/30 06:02'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 06:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['52.e67 [pii]', '10.3947/ic.2020.0068 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Infect Chemother. 2020 Sep 18. pii: 52.e67. doi: 10.3947/ic.2020.0068.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4180-6038', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1486-0303', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5392-3405', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4655-0641', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1219-9323', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9147-0478', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6653-2956', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2182-5821']",20200918,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fungal infection', '*Leukemia', '*Pneumonia', '*Schizophyllum']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent genomewide association study has identified germline polymorphisms (e.g., rs72846714) in the NT5C2 gene associated with 6-MP metabolism in patients with ALL. However, the full spectrum of genetic variation in NT5C2 is unclear and its impact on 6-MP drug activation has not been comprehensively examined. To this end, we performed targeted sequencing of NT5C2 in 588 children with ALL and identified 121 single nucleotide polymorphisms nominally associated with erythrocyte TGN during 6-MP treatment (P < 0.05). Of these, 61 variants were validated in a replication cohort of 372 children with ALL. After considering linkage disequilibrium and multivariate analysis, we confirmed two clusters of variants, represented by rs72846714 and rs58700372, that independently affected 6-MP metabolism. Functional studies showed that rs58700372 directly altered the activity of an intronic enhancer, with the variant allele linked to higher transcription activity and reduced 6-MP metabolism (lower TGN).

Here, we investigated the effects of several drugs on the mitochondrial function of the CML cell line K562 and found that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and decitabine could effectively increase the ATP content and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, these two drugs induced cell cycle arrest and a decrease in colony-forming capacity and promoted K562 cell differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrated that treatment with AICAR or decitabine enhanced the sensitivity of K562 cells to imatinib, as evidenced by a combination treatment assay.

Though many FLT3 inhibitors have been developed for clinical application with 34%-56% complete remission rate, patients would develop resistance sooner or later after initial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gilteritinib. And increasing studies have shown that several resistance related mutations of FLT3 emerged during the AML progression. Thus, further investigation is warranted for these FLT3(mut) AML patients to achieve a better treatment outcome. 4-Hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) has been investigated extensively in animal models and clinical trials as an anticancer/chemopreventive agent and is currently used for protection against cancer development/recurrence, with minimal side effects. In this study, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis and found that down-regulated genes induced by 4-HPR were associated with FLT3-ITD gene sets. CD34(+) AML stem/progenitor cells separated from 32 AML samples were treated with 4-HPR. Correlation analysis showed that AML cells with FLT3-ITD genetic alteration were more sensitive to 4-HPR treatment than those without FLT3-ITD. Next, we treated 22 primary AML cells with 4-HPR and found that 4-HPR was more toxic to AML cells with FLT3-ITD. These results indicated that 4-HPR was preferentially cytotoxic to all FLT3-ITD AML(+) cells irrespective of stem/progenitor cells or blast cells. 4-HPR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NF-kappaB inhibition might be the reason of 4-HPR selectivity on FLT3 mutated AML cells.",,"['Zhao, Xin-Ying', 'Zhang, Ran-Ran', 'Ye, Qian', 'Qiu, Fei', 'Xu, Hao-Yu', 'Wei, Feng-Gui', 'Zhang, Hui']","['Zhao XY', 'Zhang RR', 'Ye Q', 'Qiu F', 'Xu HY', 'Wei FG', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, China."", ""Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou, 510623, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, China."", ""Bioinspired Engineering and Biomechanics Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, China. zhanghuirjh@gwcmc.org.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Curr Med Sci,Current medical science,101729993,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (gilteritinib)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BQC43T81DZ (retinamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2020/10/31 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/10/30 05:58'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11596-020-2259-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11596-020-2259-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Med Sci. 2020 Oct;40(5):810-816. doi: 10.1007/s11596-020-2259-0.

Current advances in AML research yield important insights regarding both AML genetics and epigenetics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and may be useful for AML diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, a novel miRNA, hsa-miR-12462, was identified in bone marrow (BM) samples from AML patients at diagnosis by small RNA sequencing. A significant higher level of hsa-miR-12462 was found in patients who achieve complete remission (AML-CR) after induction therapy compared with those who suffer relapse/refractory (AML-RR). FosB was predicted to be the target of hsa-miR-12462 through RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and then verified by luciferase activity assay. T-5224, the inhibitor of FosB, was administered to AML cell lines, which could inhibit cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and restore the sensitivity of AML cells to cytarabine (Ara-C). In summary, a higher level of hsa-miR-12462 in AML cells is associated with increased sensitivity to Ara-C via targeting FosB.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Zhan, Jiang, Jin, Zhao, Xie, Liu, Jia, Liang and Zeng.']","['Wang, Huiwen', 'Zhan, Huien', 'Jiang, Xinya', 'Jin, Lilian', 'Zhao, Tianming', 'Xie, Shurong', 'Liu, Wei', 'Jia, Yan', 'Liang, Hui', 'Zeng, Hui']","['Wang H', 'Zhan H', 'Jiang X', 'Jin L', 'Zhao T', 'Xie S', 'Liu W', 'Jia Y', 'Liang H', 'Zeng H']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,,,PMC7573296,,2020/10/31 06:00,2020/10/31 06:01,['2020/10/30 05:55'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:55 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2020.582923 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2020 Oct 6;7:582923. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2020.582923. eCollection 2020.,582923,,20201006,['NOTNLM'],"['FosB', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemosensitivity', 'miRNA', 'targeting therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our case likely represented an acute de novo HEV infection after chemotherapy in a patient with concurrent AML, evidenced by the presence of anti-HEV IgM antibodies as well as histological findings, and with a previous history of recent transfusions being one of the strongest risk factors for transmission. Liver failure from an acute de novo hepatitis E infection with concurrent AML can be catastrophic in the immunosuppressed patient. Our case is particularly unique due to the uncommon presentation of acute hepatitis E in a non-pregnant reproductive aged Hispanic female with recently diagnosed AML.

Methods: Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to determine the location of GHET1. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to verify RNA expression. GHET1 overexpression and knockdown were achieved by transfection of the expression vector or short hairpin RNA. Western blotting, qPCR, Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, JC-1 staining, and flow cytometry were performed to measure GHET1 function. The dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the relationship between microRNA 105 (mir-105) and Ras-related protein Rap-2B (RAP2B). Results: GHET1 was localized in the nucleus of NB4 cell lines. GHET1 expression was elevated in AML cell lines compared with normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. GHET1 knockdown led to inhibition of proliferation and promoted the differentiation and apoptosis of AML cell lines. Furthermore, GHET1 directly bound to miR-105 and downregulated miR-105 expression. MiR-105 overexpression suppressed proliferation and induced the differentiation and apoptosis of AML cell lines. In addition, RAP2B was confirmed to be a target gene of miR-105 and an inverse correlation was shown between their expression levels in AML cell lines; when miR-105 increased, Rap-2B level decreased and vice versa.

Programmed cell death 1/ programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) plays an essential role in immunosuppression in multiple malignancies. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-positive patients also have an independently inferior clinical outcome. However, there are no reports on the effect of plasma soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) combined with plasma STAT3 on the prognosis of DLBCL. In this study, we investigate the relationships between plasma sPD-L1 combined with STAT3 and clinical prognosis of DLBCL. Methods: Levels of plasma sPD-L1 and STAT3 were quantified using ELISA in eighty-seven DLBCL patients. Multiplexed immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize the expression of PD-L1 in twenty-nine matched FFPE specimens from all patients. Results: The survival analysis revealed that the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in high sPD-L1 level group were poorer than that in low sPD-L1 level group (PFS, P < 0.001; OS, P < 0.001). Similarly, the PFS and OS in high STAT3 level group were also poorer than that in low STAT3 level group. Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that both high sPD-L1 and high STAT3 levels were the independent prognostic factors negatively affecting survival. In addition, patients with DLBCL having high levels of both sPD-L1 and STAT3 had a worse outcome than those patients having any one high or low levels of both (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We therefore revealed that high levels of plasma sPD-L1 and STAT3 are associated with inferior outcome for DLBCL patients, suggesting that combined measurement of their levels in plasma may be a promising prognostic strategy for DLBCL patients.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Fei, Yue', 'Yu, Jingwei', 'Li, Yang', 'Li, Linyu', 'Zhou, Shiyong', 'Zhang, Tingting', 'Li, Lanfang', 'Qiu, Lihua', 'Meng, Bin', 'Pan, Yi', 'Ren, Xiubao', 'Qian, Zhengzi', 'Wang, Xianhuo', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Fei Y', 'Yu J', 'Li Y', 'Li L', 'Zhou S', 'Zhang T', 'Li L', 'Qiu L', 'Meng B', 'Pan Y', 'Ren X', 'Qian Z', 'Wang X', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", 'Department of Radiotherapy, The Second People Hospital of Dezhou, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Immunology/Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."", ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, the Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC7591999,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2020/10/31 06:00,2020/10/31 06:01,['2020/10/30 05:54'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:54 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.47816 [doi]', 'jcav11p7001 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Oct 17;11(23):7001-7008. doi: 10.7150/jca.47816. eCollection 2020.,7001-7008,,20201017,['NOTNLM'],"['DLBCL', 'STAT3', 'biomarker', 'prognosis', 'sPD-L1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLAA-34 over expression has been observed to inhibit apoptosis in vitro. JAK2/STAT3 pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation and inhibition of apoptosis in number of cancers. However, the relationship and interaction between MLAA-34 and JAK2/STAT3 has never been investigated in AML. This study investigates and reports a novel relationship between MLAA-34 and JAK2/STAT3 pathway in AML both in vitro and in vivo. We constructed MLAA-34 knockdown vector and transfected U937 cells to observe its apoptotic activities in relation to JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in vitro and then in vivo in mouse model. Levels of expression of MLAA-34 and JAK2/STAT3 and its downstream targets were also measured in AML patients and a few volunteers. We found that MLAA-34 knockdown increased U937 apoptosis in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Components of the canonical JAK2/STAT3 pathway or its downstream targets, including c-myc, bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3, were shown to be involved in the carcinogenesis of AML. We also found that the JAK2/STAT3 pathway positively regulated MLAA-34 expression. We additionally identified a STAT3 binding site in the MLAA-34 promoter where STAT3 binds directly and activates MLAA-34 expression. In addition, MLAA-34 was found to form a complex with JAK2 and was enhanced by JAK2 activation. Correlation of MLAA-34 and JAK2/STAT3 was further confirmed in AML patients. In conclusion, MLAA-34 is a novel regulator for JAK2/STAT3 signaling, and in turn, is regulated by this interaction in a positive feedback loop. Thus we report a novel model of interaction mechanism between MLAA-34 and JAK2/STAT3 which can be utilized as a potential target for a novel therapeutic approach in AML.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Lei, Bo', 'Qian, Lu', 'Zhang, Yanping', 'Chen, Yinxia', 'Gao, Meili', 'Shah, Walayat', 'Cao, Xingmei', 'Zhang, Pengyu', 'Zhao, Wanhong', 'Liu, Jie', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Ma, Xiaorong', 'Yang, Yun', 'Meng, Xin', 'Cai, Fengmei', 'Xu, Yan', 'Luo, Jing', 'Wang, Baiyan', 'Zhang, Yang', 'He, Aili', 'Zhang, Wanggang']","['Lei B', 'Qian L', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen Y', 'Gao M', 'Shah W', 'Cao X', 'Zhang P', 'Zhao W', 'Liu J', 'Wang J', 'Ma X', 'Yang Y', 'Meng X', 'Cai F', 'Xu Y', 'Luo J', 'Wang B', 'Zhang Y', 'He A', 'Zhang W']","[""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Medical Research Center, Xi'an No.3 Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, 710008."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Medical Laboratory, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Department of Biological Science and Engineering, The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, 710049."", 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 25000, Pakistan.', ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Xi'an No.4 Hospital, Department of Pathology, 21 Jiefang Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'Second Affiliated Hospital, Shaanxi University of traditional Chinese medicine, Department of Hematology, 5 Wei Yang west road, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China.', ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Department of Hematology, 157 Xiwu Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC7592008,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2020/10/31 06:00,2020/10/31 06:01,['2020/10/30 05:54'],"['2020/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:54 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.46670 [doi]', 'jcav11p6768 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Sep 30;11(23):6768-6781. doi: 10.7150/jca.46670. eCollection 2020.,6768-6781,,20200930,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2/STAT3', 'MLAA-34', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'positive feedback loop']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutation 'hotspot' is a single arginine residue, R132. The R132H mutant of IDH1 produces the 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) carcinogen from alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG). The reduction of alpha-KG induces the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha subunit (HIF-1alpha) in the cytosol, which is a predisposing factor for carcinogenesis. R132H is the most common IDH1 mutation in humans, but mutations at the R132 residue can also occur in tumor tissues of dogs. The current study reported the discovery of a novel Tyr208Cys (Y208C) mutation in canine IDH1 (cIDH1), which was isolated from 2 of 45 canine chondrosarcoma cases. As the genomic DNA isolated from chondrosarcoma tissue was mutated, but that isolated from blood was not, Y208C mutations were considered to be spontaneous somatic mutations. The isocitrate dehydrogenase activity of the Y208C mutant was attenuated compared with that of wild-type (WT) cIDH1, but the attenuation of Y208C was less intense than that of the R132H mutation. The induction of HIF-1alpha response element activity and cell retention of HIF-1alpha were not increased by Y208C overexpression. In silico and cell biological analysis of IDH1 dimerization revealed that the Y208C mutation, but not the R132H mutation, attenuated binding activity with WT cIDH1.

Inflammation is a critical mediator in retinal degeneration (RD) diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and RD progression may be prevented through anti-inflammatory activity in RPE cells. The flavonoid polyphenol luteolin (LU) has anti-inflammatory and antidiabetes activities, but its effects regarding retinal protection remain unknown. Here, we examined the ability of luteolin to alleviate markers of inflammation related to RD in cytokine-primed APPE-19 cells. We found that luteolin decreased the levels of interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and attenuated adherence of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 to IL-1beta-stimulated ARPE-19 cells. Luteolin also increased anti-inflammatory protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels. Interestingly, luteolin induced protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, thus inhibiting nuclear factor- (NF-) kappaB transfer from cytoplasm into the nucleus and suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, cotreatment with MAPK inhibitors and luteolin decreased inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, and further suppressed THP-1 adhesion. Overall, these results provide evidence that luteolin protects ARPE-19 cells from IL-1beta-stimulated increases of IL-6, IL-8, sICAM-1, and MCP-1 production by blocking the activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, thus ameliorating the inflammatory response.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Wen-Chung Huang et al.'],"['Huang, Wen-Chung', 'Liou, Chian-Jiun', 'Shen, Szu-Chuan', 'Hu, Sindy', 'Hsiao, Chien-Yu', 'Wu, Shu-Ju']","['Huang WC', 'Liou CJ', 'Shen SC', 'Hu S', 'Hsiao CY', 'Wu SJ']","['Graduate Institute of Health Industry Technology, Research Center for Food and Cosmetic Safety, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Division of Allergy, Asthma, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Division of Allergy, Asthma, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nursing, Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, and Graduate Institute of Health Industry Technology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan 33303, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Program of Nutrition Science, National Taiwan Normal University, 88 Ting-Chow Rd, Sec 4, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Cosmetic Science, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Guishan Dist., Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Aesthetic Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Aesthetic Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Aesthetic Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan City 33303, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/*pharmacology', 'Luteolin/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",PMC7585660,"['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",2020/10/31 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2020/10/30 05:53'],"['2020/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/9421340 [doi]'],epublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2020 Oct 16;2020:9421340. doi: 10.1155/2020/9421340. eCollection 2020.,9421340,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7141-8971', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4772-1169', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3301-8808', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2370-9541']",20201016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: In silico prediction of hepatic drug metabolism for TND was determined using the StarDrop(R) WhichP450 module to confirm its metabolic liability. Second, an efficient and accurate LC-MS/MS method was established for TND quantification to evaluate metabolic stability. TND and entrectinib (ENC) (internal standard; IS) were resolved using an isocratic elution system with a reversed stationary phase (C8 column). Results: The established LC-MS/MS method exhibited linearity (5-500 ng/mL) with r(2) >/=0.9999 in the human liver microsomes matrix. The method sensitivity was indicated by the limit of quantification (3.8 ng/mL), and reproducibility was revealed by inter- and intraday precision and accuracy (below 10.5%). TND metabolic stability estimation was calculated using intrinsic clearance (22.03 microL/min/mg) and in vitro half-life (29.0 min) values. Conclusion: TND exhibited a moderate extraction ratio indicative of good bioavailability. According to the literature, the approach developed in the present study is the first established LC-MS/MS method for assessing TND metabolic stability.",['(c) 2020 Attwa et al.'],"['Attwa, Mohamed W', 'Abdelhameed, Ali S', 'Al-Shakliah, Nasser S', 'Kadi, Adnan A']","['Attwa MW', 'Abdelhameed AS', 'Al-Shakliah NS', 'Kadi AA']","['1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', '1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', '1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', '1 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*analysis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Humans', 'Microsomes, Liver/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Piperazines/*analysis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*analysis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*analysis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",PMC7591096,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],2020/10/31 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2020/10/30 05:52'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:52 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S274118 [doi]', '274118 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 Oct 23;14:4439-4449. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S274118. eCollection 2020.,4439-4449,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1147-4960', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5910-2832']",20201023,['NOTNLM'],"['in vitro half-life', 'metabolic stability assessment', 'tandutinib', 'validated LC-MS/MS methodology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This shift has facilitated the increased revelation of novel insights into pathways that lead to the survival and propagation of AML cells. These AML survival pathways are involved in drug resistance, evasion of the immune system, reprogramming metabolism, and impairing differentiation. In addition, based on the reports of enhanced clinical efficiencies when combining drugs or treatments, deeper investigation into possible pathways, which can be targeted together to increase treatment response in a wider group of patients, is warranted.

Gene mutation detection by next-generation sequence and related clinical data of 234 MDS patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed for the relationship between the clinical characteristics, treatment efficacy and prognosis of U2AF1 gene mutation. Among the 234 MDS patients, the U2AF1 gene mutation rate was 21.7% (51 cases), and the median variant allele frequency was 39.5%. Compared with the wild type, the U2AF1 mutant had a higher incidence of chromosome 8 aberration, and was positively correlated with the occurrence of ASXL1, RUNX1, SETBP1 gene mutation, negatively correlated with SF3B1, NPM1 genes mutation (p < 0.05). The most common mutation site of U2AF1 was S34F (32 cases), while U2AF1 Q157P site mutations had a higher incidence of chromosome 7 abnormalities (p = 0.003). The U2AF1 gene mutation more frequently coincided with signal pathway related gene mutations (p = 0.043) with a trend of shortened overall survival. Among patients with U2AF1 gene mutations, those with ASXL1 mutations were prone to develop into acute myeloid leukemia, those with RUNX1 mutations had an increased risk of relapse, and those with TET2 mutations had higher 1-year survival rate.

BRAF and MEK inhibitors reduce metastatic burden for patients with melanomas harboring BRAF mutations; however, most eventually relapse due to acquired resistance. Here, we demonstrate that ABL1/2 kinase activities and/or expression are potentiated in cell lines and patient samples following resistance, and ABL1/2 drive BRAF and BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance by inducing reactivation of MEK/ERK/MYC signaling. Silencing/inhibiting ABL1/2 blocks pathway reactivation, and resensitizes resistant cells to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, whereas expression of constitutively active ABL1/2 is sufficient to promote resistance. Significantly, nilotinib (2(nd) generation ABL1/2 inhibitor) reverses resistance, in vivo, causing prolonged regression of resistant tumors, and also, prevents BRAFi/MEKi resistance from developing in the first place. These data indicate that repurposing the FDA-approved leukemia drug, nilotinib, may be effective for prolonging survival for patients harboring BRAF-mutant melanomas.",,"['Tripathi, Rakshamani', 'Liu, Zulong', 'Jain, Aditi', 'Lyon, Anastasia', 'Meeks, Christina', 'Richards, Dana', 'Liu, Jinpeng', 'He, Daheng', 'Wang, Chi', 'Nespi, Marika', 'Rymar, Andrey', 'Wang, Peng', 'Wilson, Melissa', 'Plattner, Rina']","['Tripathi R', 'Liu Z', 'Jain A', 'Lyon A', 'Meeks C', 'Richards D', 'Liu J', 'He D', 'Wang C', 'Nespi M', 'Rymar A', 'Wang P', 'Wilson M', 'Plattner R']","['Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'The Jefferson Pancreas, Biliary and Related Cancer Center, Department of Surgery, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource Facility, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource Facility, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource Facility, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA.', 'Plexxikon Inc., Berkeley, CA, 94710, USA.', 'Plexxikon Inc., Berkeley, CA, 94710, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY, 40536, USA. rplat2@uky.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA177558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ARG tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ABL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",PMC7596241,,2020/10/31 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/10/30 05:46'],"['2019/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 05:46 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-19075-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-19075-3 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Oct 29;11(1):5463. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19075-3.,5463,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9394-1173', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5391-7838', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9728-3224']",20201029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated a population of mice that recovered from high-dose radiation to live normal life spans. These ""elite-survivors"" harbored distinct gut microbiota that developed after radiation and protected against radiation-induced damage and death in both germ-free and conventionally housed recipients. Elevated abundances of members of the bacterial taxa Lachnospiraceae and Enterococcaceae were associated with postradiation restoration of hematopoiesis and gastrointestinal repair. These bacteria were also found to be more abundant in leukemia patients undergoing radiotherapy, who also displayed milder gastrointestinal dysfunction. In our study in mice, metabolomics revealed increased fecal concentrations of microbially derived propionate and tryptophan metabolites in elite-survivors. The administration of these metabolites caused long-term radioprotection, mitigation of hematopoietic and gastrointestinal syndromes, and a reduction in proinflammatory responses.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Common side effects of azacitidine are weakness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, injection site reactions, insomnia, among others. Our patient received azacitidine to treat her acute myeloid leukaemia and began to develop shortness of breath which progressed to dyspnoea at rest after completing a 7-day course of azacitidine and venetoclax. Initial chest X-ray revealed severe airspace disease for which the patient began receiving broad spectrum antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals therapy. Although infectious workup revealed invasive aspergillosis she did not clinically and radiologically improve despite being on isavuconazole until high-dose glucocorticoids were initiated.

The addition of aprepitant for emesis control in children receiving induction for AML have not been explored. METHODS: A single-institutional randomised, open-label trial (NCT02979548) was conducted where children between 5 and 18 years with the diagnosis of AML being planned for 3+7 induction regimen were included. All study participants received ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) every 8 hours for 8 days starting 30 min prior to chemotherapy. Children belonging to aprepitant group additionally received aprepitant capsules (15-40 kg=days 1-3, 80 mg; >40 kg=day 1, 125 mg and days 2-3, 80 mg) starting from 1 hour prior to chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) in chemotherapy induced vomiting (CIV) in acute phase (day 1-8), delayed phase (day 9-13), overall and initial 96 hours were recorded along with severity of vomiting and adverse effects. RESULTS: Total 78 children were randomised (Aprepitant group: 37 and control group: 41). The proportion of patients with CR in CIV was significantly higher in Aprepitant group in acute phase (p=0.007), overall phase (p=0.007) and in initial 96 hours (p<0.001) but it was not different in delayed phase (p=0.07). The first episode of vomiting was also significantly delayed in aprepitant group (p=0.02). Adverse effect profile was similar in two groups. CONCLUSION: Aprepitant significantly improves emesis control in children receiving induction therapy for AML, especially in acute phase and should be routinely incorporated as part of antiemetic prophylaxis.

This disease is annually recognized in more than ten million people. Nanomaterials can be used as new strategies for cancer therapy. Nanostructured devices have been developed for drug delivery and controlled release and created novel anticancer chemotherapies. Nanomaterials were taken into consideration because of their new properties, containing a large specific surface area and high reactivity. Copper Oxide Nanoparticles (CuONPs) have potential applications in many fields like heterogeneous catalysis, antibacterial, anticancer, antioxidant, antifungal, antiviral, imaging agents, and drug delivery agents in biomedicine. CuONPs display different physical properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, electron correlation effects, and spin dynamics. NPs can be synthesized using different methods like physical, chemical, and biological methods. METHODS: Copper Oxide Nanoparticles (CuONPs) have been suggested for its broad usage in biomedical applications. In this review, we tried to exhibit the results of significant anticancer activity of green synthesized CuONPs and their characterization by different analytical techniques such as UV-Vis, FT-IR, XRD, EDAX, DLS, SEM, and TEM. RESULTS: The green method for the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles as eco-friendly, cost-effective, and facile method is the more effective method. Synthesized CuONPs from this method have an appropriate size and shape. The Green synthesized CuONPs exhibited high potential against several breast cancer (AMJ-13, MCF-7, and HBL-100 cell lines), cervical cancer (HeLa), colon cancer (HCT-116), gastric cancer (human adenocarcinoma AGS cell line), lung cancer (A549), leukemia cancer, and other cancers with the main toxicity approach of increasing ROS production. CONCLUSION: The present review confirms the importance of green synthesized CuO nanoparticles in medical science especially cancer therapy that exhibited high activity against different cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. The main toxicity approach of CuONPs is increasing the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). It needs to perform more studies about in vivo cancer therapy and following clinical trial testing in the future. We believe that green synthesized CuO nanoparticles can be used for the improvement of different diseases.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Alizadeh, Seyedeh R', 'Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad A']","['Alizadeh SR', 'Ebrahimzadeh MA']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Hemoglobinopathy Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Hemoglobinopathy Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'T8BEA5064F (cuprous oxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Copper/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Green Chemistry Technology', 'Humans', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,2020/10/31 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2020/10/30 05:32'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/30 05:32 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-111007 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666201029111532 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2021;21(12):1529-1543. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666201029111532.,1529-1543,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CuONPs', '*Green synthesis', '*ROS generation', '*anticancer activity', '*characterization', '*copper oxide nanoparticles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flower Extract.,10.2174/1389201021666201029154746 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Cancer is a non-communicable disease with increasing incidence and mortality rates worldwide, including Thailand. Its apparent lack of effective treatments is posing challenging public health issues. INTRODUCTION: Encouraging research results indicating probable anti-cancer properties of the Delonix regia flower Extract (DRE) have prompted us to evaluate the feasibility of developing a type of product for future cancer prevention or treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present report, using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), we demonstrate in the DRE the presence of high concentrations of three identifiable flavonoids, namely rutin 4.15+/-0.30% w/w, isoquercitrin 3.04+/-0.02 %w/w, and myricetin 2.61+/-0.01% w/w, respectively, while the IC50 of DPPH and ABTS assay antioxidation activity was 66.88+/-6.30 mug/ml and 53.65+/-7.24 mug/ml, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our cancer cell line studies using the MTT assay demonstrated DREs potent and dosedependent inhibition of murine leukemia cell line (P-388: 35.28+/-4.07% of cell viability remaining), as well as of human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human oral cavity carcinoma (KB), and human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cell lines in that order of magnitude. CONCLUSION: Three identifiable flavonoids (rutin, isoquercitrin and myricetin) with high antioxidation activity and potent and dose-dependent inhibition of murine leukemia cell line and five other cancer cell lines were documented in the DRE. The extract's lack of cytotoxicity in 3 normal cell lines is a rare advantage not usually seen in current antineoplastic agents. Yet another challenge of the DRE was its low dissolution rate and long-term storage stability, issues to be resolved before a future product can be formulated.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Khongkaew, Putthiporn', 'Wattanaarsakit, Phanphen', 'Papadopoulos, Konstantinos I', 'Chaemsawang, Watcharaphong']","['Khongkaew P', 'Wattanaarsakit P', 'Papadopoulos KI', 'Chaemsawang W']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Burapha University, 169 Long-haad Bangsaen Road, Saensook, Mueng, Chonburi 20131, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, 254 Phyathai Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.', 'THAI StemLife, 566/3 Soi Ramkhamhaeng 39, (Thepleela 1), Prachaouthit Rd, Wang Thonglang, Bangkok 10310, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Burapha University, 169 Long-haad Bangsaen Road, Saensook, Mueng, Chonburi 20131, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['RX5/2563/Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Burapha University']",['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Fabaceae', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flowers', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology']",,,2020/10/31 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/10/30 05:32'],"['2020/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/30 05:32 [entrez]']","['CPB-EPUB-111033 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201021666201029154746 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2021;22(13):1821-1831. doi: 10.2174/1389201021666201029154746.,1821-1831,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flamboyant) Delonix regia) Bojer (Raf(.', 'anticancer', 'antineoplastic agents', 'antioxidants', 'cell lines.', 'flavonoids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, by taking advantage of a wide and well-characterized CLL cohort (n=537), we demonstrate that CD20 expression is downregulated in SF3B1-mutated CLL in an extent similar to NOTCH1-mutated CLL. In fact, SF3B1-mutated CLL cells show common features with NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells, including a gene expression profile enriched of NOTCH1-related gene sets and elevated expression of the active intracytoplasmic NOTCH1. Activation of the NOTCH1 signaling and down-regulation of surface CD20 in SF3B1-mutated CLL cells correlate with over-expression of an alternatively spliced form of DVL2, a component of the Wnt pathway and negative regulator of the NOTCH1 pathway. These findings are confirmed by separately analyzing the CD20-dim and CD20-bright cell fractions from SF3B1-mutated cases as well as by DVL2 knock-out experiments in CLL-like cell models. Altogether, the clinical and biological features that characterize NOTCH1-mutated CLL may also be recapitulated in SF3B1-mutated CLL, contributing to explain the poor prognosis of this CLL subset and providing the rationale for expanding novel agents-based therapies to SF3B1-mutated CLL.",,"['Pozzo, Federico', 'Bittolo, Tamara', 'Tissino, Erika', 'Vit, Filippo', 'Vendramini, Elena', 'Laurenti, Luca', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Olivieri, Jacopo', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Zaja, Francesco', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Pozzo F', 'Bittolo T', 'Tissino E', 'Vit F', 'Vendramini E', 'Laurenti L', ""D'Arena G"", 'Olivieri J', 'Pozzato G', 'Zaja F', 'Chiarenza A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Zucchetto A', 'Bomben R', 'Rossi FM', 'Del Poeta G', 'Dal Bo M', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy. federico.pozzo@cro.it.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy; University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO) IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Hematology Institute, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Fondazione Policlinico A.

Our aim was to investigate the addition of bendamustine (B) to these Ven-containing regimens in relapsed/refractory (R/R) or first-line (1L) CLL. This multi-arm, non-randomized, open-label, phase 1b study was designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety/tolerability of Ven with BR/BG, with 3+3 dose-escalation followed by safety expansion. Patients received Ven (schedule A) or BR/BG first (schedule B) to compare safety and determine dose/schedule for expansion. Six Ven-BR/-BG cycles were to be administered, then Ven monotherapy until disease progression (R/R) or fixed-duration 1-year treatment (1L). Overall, 33 R/R and 50 1L patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed (doses 100-400-mg), and the MTD was not reached. Safety was similar between schedules; no tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred during dose-finding. Schedule B and Ven 400-mg were chosen for expansion. The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia: R/R 64%, 1L Ven-BR 85%, 1L Ven-BG 55%. Grade 3-4 infection rate was: R/R 27%, 1L Ven-BR 0%, 1L Ven-BG 27%. During expansion, one clinical and two laboratory TLS cases occurred. Fewer than half the patients completed six combination therapy cycles with all study drugs; rates of bendamustine discontinuation were high. Overall response rate was 91% in R/R and 100% in 1L patients (16/49 1L patients received Ven for >1 year).

Here, we studied the signaling events downstream of IL1RAP in relation to leukemogenesis and normal hematopoiesis. High IL1RAP expression was associated with a leukemic GMP-like state, and knockdown of IL1RAP in AML reduced colony-forming capacity. Stimulation with IL1beta resulted in the induction of multiple chemokines and an inflammatory secretome via the p38 MAPK and NFkappaB signaling pathways in IL1RAP-expressing AML cells, but IL1beta-induced signaling was dispensable for AML cell proliferation and NFkappaB-driven survival. IL1RAP was also expressed in stromal cells where IL1beta induced expression of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines as well. Intriguingly, the IL1beta-induced inflammatory secretome of IL1RAPexpressing AML cells grown on a stromal layer of mesenchymal stem cells affected normal hematopoiesis including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells while AML cell proliferation was not affected. The addition of Anakinra, an FDA-approved IL1 receptor antagonist, could reverse this effect. Therefore, blocking the IL1-IL1RAP signaling axis might be a good therapeutic approach to reduce inflammation in the bone marrow niche and thereby promote normal hematopoietic recovery over AML proliferation after chemotherapy.",,"['De Boer, Bauke', 'Sheveleva, Sofia', 'Apelt, Katja', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Mulder, Andre B', 'Huls, Gerwin', 'Jacob Schuringa, Jan']","['De Boer B', 'Sheveleva S', 'Apelt K', 'Vellenga E', 'Mulder AB', 'Huls G', 'Jacob Schuringa J']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands; Present address: The Finsen Laboratory, Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. j.j.schuringa@umcg.nl.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (IL1RAP protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein', '*Interleukin-1beta', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', '*Stem Cell Niche']",PMC8634188,,2020/10/31 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/10/30 04:47'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/30 04:47 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.254987 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Dec 1;106(12):3067-3078. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.254987.,3067-3078,,20211201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of various targeted Notch pathway inhibitors may vary due to variabilities in Notch pathway activity among individual patients. The quantitative measurement of Notch pathway activity is therefore essential to identify patients who could benefit from targeted treatment. METHODS: We here describe a new assay that infers a quantitative Notch pathway activity score from the mRNA levels of generally conserved direct NOTCH target genes. Following the calibration and biological validation of our Notch pathway activity model over a wide spectrum of human cancer types, we assessed Notch pathway activity in a cohort of T-ALL patient samples and related it to biological and clinical parameters, including outcome. RESULTS: We developed an assay using 18 select direct target genes and high-grade serous ovarian cancer for calibration. For validation, seven independent human datasets (mostly cancer series) were used to quantify Notch activity in agreement with expectations. For T-ALL, the median Notch pathway activity was highest for samples with strong NOTCH1-activating mutations, and T-ALL patients of the TLX subtype generally had the highest levels of Notch pathway activity. We observed a significant relationship between ICN1 levels and the absence/presence of NOTCH1-activating mutations with Notch pathway activity scores. Patients with the lowest Notch activity scores had the shortest event-free survival compared to other patients. CONCLUSIONS: High Notch pathway activity was not limited to T-ALL samples harboring strong NOTCH1 mutations, including juxtamembrane domain mutations or hetero-dimerization combined with PEST-domain or FBXW7 mutations, indicating that additional mechanisms may activate Notch signaling. The measured Notch pathway activity was related to intracellular NOTCH levels, indicating that the pathway activity score more accurately reflects Notch pathway activity than when it is predicted on the basis of NOTCH1 mutations. Importantly, patients with low Notch pathway activity had a significantly shorter event-free survival compared to patients showing higher activity.",,"['Cante-Barrett, Kirsten', 'Holtzer, Laurent', 'van Ooijen, Henk', 'Hagelaar, Rico', ""Cordo', Valentina"", 'Verhaegh, Wim', 'van de Stolpe, Anja', 'Meijerink, Jules P P']","['Cante-Barrett K', 'Holtzer L', 'van Ooijen H', 'Hagelaar R', ""Cordo' V"", 'Verhaegh W', 'van de Stolpe A', 'Meijerink JPP']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Philips Molecular Pathway Dx, Royal Philips, 5656 AE Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Philips Research, Royal Philips, 5656 AE Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Philips Research, Royal Philips, 5656 AE Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Philips Molecular Pathway Dx, Royal Philips, 5656 AE Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Kika-295/Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij', 'KiKa-219/Stichting Kinderen Kankervrij', 'KWF-10355/KWF Kankerbestrijding']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7692325,,2020/10/31 06:00,2020/10/31 06:01,['2020/10/30 01:01'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12113142 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12113142 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Oct 27;12(11). pii: cancers12113142. doi: 10.3390/cancers12113142.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0418-8445', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9607-7317', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1373-513X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8088-9924', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6860-798X']",20201027,['NOTNLM'],"['NOTCH1 mutation', 'Notch pathway activity', 'T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are equipped with a vast array of receptors that recognize tumor cells and other pathogens. The innate immune activity of NK cells develops faster than the adaptive one performed by T cells, and studies suggest an important immunoregulatory role for each population against the other. The association, observed in acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving haploidentical killer-immunoglobulin-like-receptor-mismatched NK cells, with induction of complete remission was the determinant to begin an increasing number of clinical studies administering NK cells for the treatment of cancer patients. Unfortunately, even though transfused NK cells demonstrated safety, their observed efficacy was poor. In recent years, novel studies have emerged, combining NK cells with other immunotherapeutic agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, which might improve clinical efficacy. Moreover, genetically-modified NK cells aimed at arming NK cells with better efficacy and persistence have appeared as another option. Here, we review novel pre-clinical and clinical studies published in the last five years administering NK cells as a monotherapy and combined with other agents, and we also review chimeric antigen receptor-modified NK cells for the treatment of cancer patients. We then describe studies regarding the role of NK cells as anti-microbial effectors, as lessons that we could learn and apply in immunotherapy applications of NK cells; these studies highlight an important immunoregulatory role performed between T cells and NK cells that should be considered when designing immunotherapeutic strategies.

We sought to understand the severity and symptoms' co-occurrence among pediatric survivors compared to controls by rating both self- and parent-reported symptomatology. Forty survivors (22 males; mean age at study time: 12.9 years) participated in the study. Most survivors (85%) had a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Seventy-nine healthy controls with the same age and gender distribution as the patients were included. A standardized assessment of psychological functioning was conducted by self- and parent-reported symptoms evaluations. The self-reported anxious symptom severity was significantly higher in survivors. A significantly higher proportion of survivors compared to controls had clinically significant anxiety, depression, and combined anxiety symptoms (i.e., social anxiety, separation anxiety, or physical symptoms). In both study groups, the self-reported emotional and somatic symptoms were significantly associated. The multi-informant assessments of the psychological symptoms revealed distinct associations between the child- and parent-reported symptoms in the survivors' group: the survivors' self-reports of depressive symptoms, somatic symptoms, and functional impairment were significantly correlated with the parent reports of child behavioral concerns, somatic complaints, and functional impairment, respectively. Conclusion: Self-reported symptoms showed similar comorbidity profiles in survivors and control peers. The multi-informant assessments detected differences in the association of self- and parent-reported symptoms between the survivor and control groups. The present study showed that multi-informant assessment is critical to understanding symptom profiles and to informing intervention with particular regard to parental participation and support.",,"['Barone, Rita', 'Gulisano, Mariangela', 'Cannata, Emanuela', 'Padalino, Sara', 'Saia, Federica', 'Maugeri, Nicoletta', 'Pettinato, Fabio', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Casabona, Antonino', 'Russo, Giovanna', 'Di Cataldo, Andrea', 'Rizzo, Renata']","['Barone R', 'Gulisano M', 'Cannata E', 'Padalino S', 'Saia F', 'Maugeri N', 'Pettinato F', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Casabona A', 'Russo G', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Rizzo R']","['Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, Section of Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7693519,,2020/10/31 06:00,2020/10/31 06:01,['2020/10/30 01:01'],"['2020/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9113444 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9113444 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Oct 27;9(11). pii: jcm9113444. doi: 10.3390/jcm9113444.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6302-2686', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4463-098X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2480-1799', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0180-4695', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9369-7473', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4509-3066']",20201027,['NOTNLM'],"['emotional symptoms', 'parent-reported symptoms', 'pediatric cancer survivors', 'self-reported symptoms', 'symptoms co-occurrence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML) protein can regulate SLIT2 expression in the central nervous system, little is known about SLIT2 in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Hence, we aimed to investigate the levels of SLIT2 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and assess its biological activity in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis indicated that blasts with SLIT2(high) transcript levels were associated with cell cycle arrest, while SLIT2(low) APL blasts displayed a more stem-cell like phenotype. In a retrospective analysis using a cohort of patients treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracyclines, high SLIT2 expression was correlated with reduced leukocyte count (p = 0.024), and independently associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.97; p < 0.001). Functionally, SLIT2-knockdown in primary APL blasts and cell lines led to increased cell proliferation and resistance to arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis. Finally, in vivo transplant of Slit2-silenced primary APL blasts promoted increased leukocyte count (p = 0.001) and decreased overall survival (p = 0.002) compared with the control. In summary, our data highlight the tumor suppressive function of SLIT2 in APL and its deteriorating effects on disease progression when downregulated.",,"['Weinhauser, Isabel', 'Pereira-Martins, Diego

However, variants APL who carry PLZF/RARsmall a, Cyrillic, STAT5B/RARsmall a, Cyrillic, and STAT3/RARsmall a, Cyrillic are insensitive to ATRA and have poor prognoses. The standard treatment for variants APL is still unclear due to the small sample size. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we reported a Chinese male who was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of rib pain, dyspnea, and fever (37.5 degrees C). Blood tests showed leukopenia (1.83 x 10/L), anemia (hemoglobin 73 g/L), and thrombocytopenia (54 x 10/L). Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as STAT5b-RARa-positive APL based on the clinical and laboratory findings. INTERVENTIONS: ATRA was used immediately for induction treatment, then he was treated with ATRA + arsenic trioxide and got the severe cardiac insufficiency. Subsequently, consolidation chemotherapy was added with ATRA + Huangdai tablets + idarubicin and decitabine, cytarabine, aclamycin (DCAG). OUTCOMES: The patient relapsed soon after his first molecular complete remission (CRm), fortunately, he got a second CRm with DCAG. He has survived for more than 9 months and remains CRm, now he is looking for a suitable donor to prepare for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). LESSONS: APL patients with STAT5B-RARa is not only resistant to ATRA, but also to conventional combination chemotherapy such as daunorubicin and cytarabine/idarubicin and cytarabine or other regimens. Relapse and extramedullary infiltration is common, HSCT is a effective treatment, and the best time for HSCT is after the first CR. It should be noted that this patient got CRm with DCAG after relapse, so the role of decitabine in APL with STAT5B-RARa needs to be considered.",,"['Wang, Lei', 'Yan, Xiaojing', 'He, Juan']","['Wang L', 'Yan X', 'He J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Asians/genetics', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",PMC7581092,,2020/10/31 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/10/30 01:01'],"['2020/10/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000022923 [doi]', '00005792-202010230-00121 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Oct 23;99(43):e22923. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000022923.,e22923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor rarely precedes leukemia without bone marrow involvement and is called primary GS. Although primary GS can occur in any body part, the involvement of the oral cavity is uncommon. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old woman hospitalized at the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery presented with a growing mass in her left maxillary hard palate dating two months back. No obvious physical findings were noted during general examination. She was diagnosed with an oral ulcer at a local clinic, and received antibiotics. However, the symptoms did not improve; the mass became bigger and painful. DIAGNOSIS: An incisional biopsy of the oral mass was performed, the immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells tested positive for myeloperoxidase, CD4, BCL-2, KI-67. Bone marrow aspiration was negative for malignant cells, and the laboratory test results revealed only monocytosis. Standard bone marrow cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype and leukemia-related fusion gene detection was normal. Therefore, the final diagnosis was intraoral primary GS. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with a chemotherapy regimen based on idarubicin and cytarabine arabinoside. OUTCOMES: After 2 cycles of idarubicin and cytarabine arabinoside regimen chemotherapy, the patient achieved complete remission. The tumor was barely visible in the left maxillary hard palate. There has been no evidence of disease spread and progression after 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Careful morphological and immunohistochemical analyses, correlating with clinical data are necessary to establish the diagnosis of oral primary GS. Early aggressive systemic chemotherapy can effectively relieve symptoms, significantly reducing primary GS conversion into acute myelocytic leukemia and prolonging overall survival.",,"['Hu, Yun-Gang', 'Deng, Xiao-Hua', 'Lei, Wei', 'Li, Xiao-Lin']","['Hu YG', 'Deng XH', 'Lei W', 'Li XL']","['Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, The Peoples Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University.', 'Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, The Peoples Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University.', 'Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, The Peoples Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University.', ""Key Laboratory of Maxillofacial Plastic and Reconstructive surgery, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China, 92 Aiguo road, Nanchang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'Primary granulocytic sarcoma']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth/pathology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology']",PMC7581149,,2020/10/31 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/10/30 01:01'],"['2020/10/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000022820 [doi]', '00005792-202010230-00082 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Oct 23;99(43):e22820. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000022820.,e22820,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7433-923'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10% of influenza-infected children with ALL or other types of cancer need intensive care, and 5% of them eventually die. PATIENTS' CONCERNS: We report 2 children with ALL and the swine-origin influenza A virus infection. Diagnosing influenza in them was a challenge. Medical records of these children were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Patients were hospitalized in the Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantology of the Medical University of Lublin, Poland. Case 1 involved a 2-year-old girl who, according to acute lymphoblastic leukemia intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol 2009, started chemotherapy in July 2015. She was categorized in the intermediate risk group and received the induction and consolidation phase of the therapy without severe complications. The reinduction therapy was administered in the outpatient department till the 15 day. On the 20 day of this phase, she was admitted to our department with fever, mucositis, tachypnea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In September 2009, a 14-year-old boy (case 2) who, according to acute lymphoblastic leukemia intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster protocol 2002, was categorized in the high-risk (HR) group, received the induction (Protocol I) phase of therapy without severe complications. On the 7 day of the HR-1 course, he manifested fever and strong, tiring cough, followed by strong mucositis. Chemotherapy had to be interrupted in both children. DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory viral infections, causing pneumonia, occurred in both patients during anticancer treatment. Initially, the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for the swine-origin influenza A was negative in both patients, which delayed the diagnosis. Additionally, bacterial, and fungal complications were also observed.

In this paper we contribute to the existing literature by analyzing the diverse alternatives that optimal therapy models offer to design personalized treatments. Taking as the starting point the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) optimal therapy model in [25], we design personalized optimal therapy models for patients with: CML; CML with intrinsic and/or induced resistance to the administered drug; CML and suffering high drug toxicity and/or allergy to the administered drug; and CML with presence of adverse factors. Along the paper we show that the clinical and medical applicability -the ultimate objective of this biomathematical research- of our proposed personalized models relies on the joint and proper use of the implemented calibration, simulation, and mathematical approaches and techniques.

Damage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) induced by benzene and its metabolites is a key event in bone marrow (BM) depression and leukemogenesis. There are no reports on transcriptome profiles of HSCs following benzene exposure. Here, Smart-seq2 single-cell transcriptome sequencing was used to detect transcriptomic alternations in BM HSCs and peripheral blood HSCs (PBSCs) in male C57B/6 mice exposed to benzene. We found that benzene caused hematotoxicity which was confirmed by routine blood test, pathological examination, and HSCs percentage analysis. A total of 1514 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BM HSCs and 1703 DEGs in PBSCs were screened after treatment with benzene. Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed that pathways in cancer, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, and hematopoietic cell lineage are vital pathways involved in benzene-induced toxicity in BM HSCs, whereas hematopoietic cell lineage and leukocyte transendothelial migration are critical pathways in PBSCs. Of note, there were 164 common DEGs in both HSCs, out of which 53 genes were co-regulated in both types of HSCs. Subsequent pathway analysis of these 53 genes indicated that the most relevant pathways involved neutrophil degranulation and CD93 localized in the core of the network of the 53 genes, which are known to regulate leukemia stem cell self-renewal and quiescence. Our results could enhance our understanding of HSC responses to benzene, facilitate the identification of potential molecular biomarkers and future studies on its mechanism of toxicity toward HSCs.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

NK cells express an array of germline-encoded receptors which allow them to eliminate transformed cells and spare normal, healthy cells. Owing to their ability to kill circulating tumor cells, NK cells play a major role in the protection against cancer metastases. There is also convincing evidence that NK cells protect against some hematological cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia. However, the importance of NK cells for the control of established solid tumors is rather uncertain. Several mechanisms impede NK cell-mediated elimination of solid tumors, starting with the incapacity of NK cells to infiltrate the core of the tumor. In addition, immune escape mechanisms are at play in both solid and hematological cancers. These include the immunoediting of tumor cells and aberrant chronic inflammation that renders NK cells ineffective. In this chapter, I review the phenotypic characteristics of NK cells within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, I describe the mechanisms by which NK cells contribute to antitumor immunity.

To test this assumption experimentally, we examined the expression pattern of the nucleolar rRNA processing factor SURF6 in normal (resting) peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphocytes activated for proliferation in vitro, and in blood samples from patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. Using two methods (immunofluorescence and immunoblotting), we for the first time showed that the SURF6 protein is not detected in normal lymphocytes but can easily be visualized in lymphocytes after PHA activation and in lymphocytes of lymphocytic leukemia patients.

Preclinical work suggested that addition of azacitidine to ivosidenib enhances mIDH1 inhibition-related differentiation and apoptosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, multicenter, phase Ib trial comprising dose-finding and expansion stages to evaluate safety and efficacy of combining oral ivosidenib 500 mg once daily continuously with subcutaneous azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) on days 1-7 in 28-day cycles in patients with newly diagnosed mIDH1 AML ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02677922). RESULTS: Twenty-three patients received ivosidenib plus azacitidine (median age, 76 years; range, 61-88 years). Treatment-related grade >/= 3 adverse events occurring in > 10% of patients were neutropenia (22%), anemia (13%), thrombocytopenia (13%), and electrocardiogram QT prolongation (13%). Adverse events of special interest included all-grade IDH differentiation syndrome (17%), all-grade electrocardiogram QT prolongation (26%), and grade >/= 3 leukocytosis (9%). Median treatment duration was 15.1 months (range, 0.3-32.2 months); 10 patients remained on treatment as of February 19, 2019. The overall response rate was 78.3% (18/23 patients; 95% CI, 56.3% to 92.5%), and the complete remission rate was 60.9% (14/23 patients; 95% CI, 38.5% to 80.3%). With median follow-up of 16 months, median duration of response in responders had not been reached. The 12-month survival estimate was 82.0% (95% CI, 58.8% to 92.8%). mIDH1 clearance in bone marrow mononuclear cells by BEAMing (beads, emulsion, amplification, magnetics) digital polymerase chain reaction was seen in 10/14 patients (71.4%) achieving complete remission. CONCLUSION: Ivosidenib plus azacitidine was well tolerated, with an expected safety profile consistent with monotherapy with each agent.

33119245,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,POT1 Tumor Predisposition,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: POT1 tumor predisposition (POT1-TPD) is characterized by an increased lifetime risk for multiple cutaneous melanomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), angiosarcoma (particularly cardiac angiosarcomas), and gliomas. Additional cancers (e.g., colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, breast angiosarcomas) have been reported in individuals with POT1-TPD but with very limited evidence. The age of onset for first primary cutaneous melanoma ranges from 15 to 80 years. The majority of POT1 associated cancers are diagnosed in adulthood. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of POT1-TPD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in POT1 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: The treatments for POT1-TPD tumors are those used in standard practice. Surveillance: Full skin examination by a dermatologist beginning at age 18 years at least every six months with excision of any lesions suspicious for melanoma; consider exams every three months in individuals with multiple atypical nevi, history of melanoma, and/or family history of melanoma. CBC with differential annually beginning at age 18 years to screen for CLL. Annual comprehensive physical examination including examination of lymph nodes. Whole-body MRI annually in families fulfilling Li-Fraumeni syndrome or Li-Fraumeni-like criteria beginning at age 18 years; Consider whole-body MRI every one to two years depending on personal and family history of non-cutaneous, non-brain malignancies. Consider brain MRI every one to two years beginning at age 18 years depending on family history of glioma. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Tanning bed use and unprotected sun exposure. Avoid radiation in diagnostic procedures. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for the familial POT1 pathogenic variant should be offered to first-degree relatives to identify those who would benefit from early surveillance and intervention. Although molecular genetic testing for POT1-TPD is generally not recommended for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years, a history of early cancers in the family may warrant predictive testing prior to age 18. GENETIC COUNSELING: POT1-TPD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most individuals diagnosed with POT1-TPD have an affected parent; the proportion of POT1-TPD caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with POT1-TPD has a 50% chance of inheriting the POT1 pathogenic variant. It is important to note that clinical manifestations of POT1-TPD cannot be predicted in heterozygous family members because the full phenotypic spectrum and penetrance of POT1-TPD are unknown. The types of POT1-related tumors can vary among different members of the same family and current evidence is limited to disease-focused studies. Once the germline POT1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for POT1-TPD and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

METHODS: The authors reviewed cases of patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-mutated AML with concurrent IDH mutations diagnosed between January 2011 and December 2018. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 or IDH2 ""double-mutated"" AML were identified; 36 patients had concurrent FLT3-ITD/IDH1 mutations (18 in the frontline and 18 in the recurrent and/or refractory [R/R] setting) and 55 patients had concurrent FLT3-ITD/IDH2 mutations (37 in the frontline and 18 in the R/R setting). FLT3 and/or IDH inhibitors (FLT3Is and/or IDHIs) were given as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy (CCT) or low-intensity therapy (LIT). Rates of complete remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) with the use of CCT and FLT3Is were 100% and 64%, respectively, in patients in the frontline and R/R settings. CCT with IDHIs was given in 2 frontline patients and both achieved a CR. LIT with FLT3Is in the frontline and R/R settings demonstrated CR and CRi rates of 67% and 28%, respectively. Single-agent FLT3Is and IDHIs demonstrated limited activity with a CR and/or CRi rate of 14% in patients with disease in the R/R setting. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of FLT3I-based therapy with CCT or LIT appeared to be effective in both the frontline and R/R settings among patients with FLT3-ITD/IDH co-mutated disease. Fewer patients with double-mutated disease received CCT or LIT with IDH1/2 inhibitor in the frontline setting; however, high response rates also were noted with this approach. LAY SUMMARY: The prognostic influence of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) co-mutation status on outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving an FLT3 inhibitor, non-FLT3/IDH inhibitor-based regimens, or an IDH inhibitor is unclear. This is an important clinical question because multiple targeted therapies for FLT3 and IDH1/2 mutations have become available. The results of the current study demonstrated that a combination of a FLT3 inhibitor with cytotoxic chemotherapy or low-intensity therapy appears to be an effective approach in patients with FLT3-ITD/IDH co-mutated disease in both the frontline and recurrent and/or refractory settings. Fewer dual-mutated patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy or low-intensity therapy with an IDH1/2 inhibitor in the frontline setting; however, excellent responses also were observed with this approach.",['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],"['Shoukier, Mahran', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Alotaibi, Ahmad S', 'Alfayez, Mansour', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Samra, Bachar', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Daver, Naval']","['Shoukier M', 'Kadia T', 'Konopleva M', 'Alotaibi AS', 'Alfayez M', 'Loghavi S', 'Patel KP', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Cortes J', 'Samra B', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Takahashi K', 'Pierce S', 'Short NJ', 'Yilmaz M', 'Sasaki K', 'Masarova L', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Borthakur G', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ravandi F', 'DiNardo CD', 'Daver N']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['The Charif Souki Cancer Research Fund and generous philanthropic contributions to', 'the MD Anderson Moon Shots Program', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, the authors evaluated differences in TKI initiation, health care use, cost, and survival among patients with CML with continuous Medicare Parts A and B and Part D coverage who were diagnosed between 2007 and 2015. RESULTS: A total of 941 patients were included. Approximately 29% of all patients did not initiate treatment with TKIs within 6 months (non-TKI users), and had lower rates of BCR-ABL testing and more hospitalizations compared with TKI users. Approximately 21% were not found to have any TKI claims at any time. TKI initiation rates within 6 months of diagnosis increased for all patients over time (61% to 85%), with greater improvements observed in patients receiving subsidies (55% to 90%). Total Medicare costs were greater in patients treated with TKIs, with approximately 50% because of TKI costs. Non-TKI users had more inpatient costs compared with TKI users. Trends in cost remained significant when adjusting for age and comorbidities. The median overall survival was 40 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 34-48 months) compared with 86 months (95% CI, 73 months to not reached), respectively, for non-TKI users versus TKI users, a finding that remained consistent when adjusting for age, comorbidities, and subsidy status (hazard ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.77-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 21% of all patients with CML did not receive TKIs at any time. Cost-sharing subsidies consistently are found to be associated with higher initiation rates. Non-TKI users had higher inpatient costs and poorer survival outcomes. Interventions to lower TKI costs for all patients are desirable.",['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],"['Seymour, Erlene K', 'Ruterbusch, Julie J', 'Winn, Aaron N', 'George, Julie A', 'Beebe-Dimmer, Jennifer L', 'Schiffer, Charles A']","['Seymour EK', 'Ruterbusch JJ', 'Winn AN', 'George JA', 'Beebe-Dimmer JL', 'Schiffer CA']","['Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cost Sharing/*economics', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Medicare/*economics', 'Medication Adherence', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2020/10/30 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/10/29 12:13'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/29 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33267 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Jan 1;127(1):93-102. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33267.

Addition of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) to standard immunosuppressive agents reduces GVHD in different donor settings. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of adults with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors after the use of PTCY (n = 197) or ATG (n = 1913). RESULTS: Patients in the PTCY group were younger than those in the ATG group (median age, 47 vs 54 years; P < .01). Peripheral blood was the most frequently used stem cell source, being significantly more frequent in the ATG group than in the PTCY group (95% vs 70% P < .01). The conditioning regimen was more frequently myeloablative in the PTCY group than in the ATG group (59% vs 48%; P < .01). Time to neutrophil engraftment was shorter in the ATG group than in the PTCY group (17 vs 20 days; P < .01). No differences were observed according to the other transplantation outcomes, except for chronic GVHD of all grades and extensive chronic GVHD at 2 years, which were significantly lower in the ATG group compared with the PTCY group (P < .02). CONCLUSION: PTCY is feasible in an HLA-identical sibling setting, and despite similar outcomes, ATG may be associated with lower incidence of chronic GVHD.",['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],"['Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Hamladji, Rose-Marie', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Gerbitz, Armin', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Meijer, Ellen', 'Koc, Yener', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Paul, Franciane', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Battipaglia G', 'Labopin M', 'Hamladji RM', 'Blaise D', 'Chevallier P', 'Brissot E', 'Gerbitz A', 'Socie G', 'Afanasyev B', 'Ciceri F', 'Meijer E', 'Koc Y', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Huynh A', 'Ozdogu H', 'Maertens J', 'Paul F', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Ruggeri A', 'Aljurf M', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Savani B', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","[""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Hematology Department, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne University, INSERM U938, Paris, France.', 'Centre Pierre et Marie Curie, Service Hematologie Greffe de Moelle, Alger, Algeria.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', ""CHU Nantes, Department D'Hematologie, Nantes, France."", ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Hospital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne University, INSERM U938, Paris, France.', 'Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Medizinische Klinik m.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1378 cancer patients aged 0-19 years, diagnosed with cancer between August 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015 in Rio Grande do Sul, who received hospital treatment in institutions affiliated with the Universal Health Care System (Sistema Unico de Saude [SUS]). RESULTS: Most children and adolescents were male (56.9%) and White (75.8%). The most common types of cancer in our cohort were acute leukemia (40.7%), followed by lymphoma (15.9%) and central nervous system tumors (8.8%). Ninety-five percent of the patients were treated in specialized pediatric oncology centers. The cumulative probability of survival at 5 years for all patients was 73.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.4-76.0%). Survival was significantly higher for patients younger than 4 years of age (P = .012) compared to all other age groups. Patients treated in institutions with a pediatric oncology patient volume of less than 15 patients/year were 41% more likely to die than patients treated in institutions with a volume of 60 patients/year or more (P = .029). CONCLUSION: Cancer is the leading cause of death by natural causes in all age groups in Brazil, but, even so, childhood tumors are rare. This complexity makes childhood cancer care a challenge.

Its prognosis is influenced by a complex network of genetic interactions. In this study, we determined the potential key factors in the pathogenesis of this condition. METHODS: We constructed scale-free gene coexpression network using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The analysis was carried out on the GSE8586 dataset, which contains the expression profiles of umbilical cord tissue homogenates from 20 neonates with BPD and 34 unaffected controls. RESULTS: Our analysis identified one significantly downregulated coexpression module related to the BPD phenotype. It was significantly enriched in genes related to human T-cell leukemia virus infection and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this module, the expression of the following four hub genes in infants with BPD was significantly decreased: Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), BTG antiproliferation factor 2 (BTG2), Jun proto-oncogene (JUN), and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). The downregulation of these hub genes was verified in clinical samples derived from blood and umbilical cord tissue. CONCLUSION: The decreased expression of FOS, BTG2, JUN, and EGR1 is associated with BPD and, therefore, could be used as biomarkers to diagnose early BPD.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Liu, Wangkai', 'Su, Yihua', 'Li, Sitao', 'Chen, Haitian', 'Liu, Yumei', 'Li, Xiaoyu', 'Shen, Wei', 'Zhong, Xinqi', 'Wu, Fan', 'Meng, Qiong', 'Jiang, Xiaoyun']","['Liu W', 'Su Y', 'Li S', 'Chen H', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Shen W', 'Zhong X', 'Wu F', 'Meng Q', 'Jiang X']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Neonatology, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Third Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Third Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Pulmonol,Pediatric pulmonology,8510590,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (FOS protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (JUN protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Umbilical Cord']",,,2020/10/30 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/10/29 08:41'],"['2020/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/29 08:41 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ppul.25141 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Pulmonol. 2021 Feb;56(2):392-399. doi: 10.1002/ppul.25141.

A newly developed PV treatment option, ropeginterferon alfa-2b, contains recombinant human alfa monoisomer as an active ingredient, resulting in a novel pharmacologic profile and improved tolerability. Efficacy studies conclude remarkable long-term hematological response and sustained JAK2V617F allele burden reduction. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b compound has been approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera without symptomatic splenomegaly. AREAS COVERED: Current clinical trials are investigating the role of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in the first-line setting of treatment for PV. The safety and efficacy results of completed trials are summarized in this review. Metabolic, pharmacokinetic issues are also discussed of ropeginterferon alfa-2b. EXPERT OPINION: Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a targeted therapeutic option in the treatment of PV, representing a significant improvement compared to conventional cytoreductive therapies. The single isomer entity of the recombinant human interferon alfa-2b and the mono-pegylation method imparts favorable properties to the compound. The use of ropeginterferon alfa-2b allows extended dosing interval, reduces side effects, and may increase the overall survival of PV patients by reducing the risk of progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia.

An important characteristic of EV is that their composition, abundance, and roles are tightly related to the parental cells. This translates into a higher release of characteristic pro-tumor EV by cancer cells that leads to harming signals toward healthy microenvironment cells. In line with this, the key role of tumor-derived EV in cancer progression was demonstrated in multiple studies and is considered a hot topic in the field of oncology. Given their characteristics, tumor-derived EV carry important information concerning the state of tumor cells. This can be used to follow the outset, development, and progression of the neoplasia and to evaluate the design of appropriate therapeutic strategies. In keeping with this, the present brief review will focus on B-cell malignancies and how EV can be used as potential biomarkers to follow disease progression and stage. Furthermore, we will explore several proposed strategies aimed at using biologically engineered EV for treatment (e.g., drug delivery mechanisms) as well as for impairing the biogenesis, release, and internalization of cancer-derived EV, with the final objective to disrupt tumor-microenvironment communication.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Gargiulo, Morande, Largeot, Moussay and Paggetti.']","['Gargiulo, Ernesto', 'Morande, Pablo Elias', 'Largeot, Anne', 'Moussay, Etienne', 'Paggetti, Jerome']","['Gargiulo E', 'Morande PE', 'Largeot A', 'Moussay E', 'Paggetti J']","['Tumor-Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor-Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Tumor-Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor-Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor-Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7550802,,2020/10/30 06:00,2020/10/30 06:01,['2020/10/29 05:53'],"['2020/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.580874 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 29;10:580874. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.580874. eCollection 2020.,580874,,20200929,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'EV-based therapy', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these conditions are not exclusive, and overlap between them leads to another classification, MDS/MPN. As well as phenotype continuity, these three conditions may have genetic relationships that have not yet been identified. This study aimed to obtain their mutational profiles by meta-analysis and explore possible similarities and differences. We reviewed screening studies of gene mutations, published from January 2000 to March 2020, from PubMed and Web of Science. Fifty-three articles were eligible for the meta-analysis, and at most 9,809 cases were involved for any gene. The top mutant genes and their pooled mutation rates were as follows: SF3B1 (20.2% [95% CI 11.6-30.5%]) in MDS, TET2 (39.2% [95% CI 21.7-52.0%]) in MDS/MPN, and JAK2 (67.9% [95% CI 64.1-71.6%]) in MPN. Subgroup analysis revealed that leukemic transformation-related genes were more commonly mutated in high-risk MDS (MDS with multilineage dysplasia and MDS with excess blasts) than that in other MDS entities. Thirteen genes including ASXL1, U2AF1, SRSF2, SF3B1, and ZRSR2 had significantly higher mutation frequencies in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) compared with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera; this difference distinguished PMF from MPN and likened it to MDS. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia were similar entities but showed several mutational differences. A heat map demonstrated that juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis were two distinct entities, whereas MDS/MPN-unclassifiable was closest to high-risk MDS. Such genetic closeness or difference reflected features in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and progression of these conditions, and could inspire future genetic studies.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Wan and Han.'],"['Wan, Ziqi', 'Han, Bing']","['Wan Z', 'Han B']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Systematic Review'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7575718,,2020/10/30 06:00,2020/10/30 06:01,['2020/10/29 05:53'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.579221 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Oct 7;10:579221. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.579221. eCollection 2020.,579221,,20201007,['NOTNLM'],"['gene', 'mutation frequency', 'myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)', 'myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN)', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, an overall analysis of metabolic markers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is absent and urgently needed. Methods: Within this work, genetic expression, mutation data and clinical data of AML were queried from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The tumor samples of TCGA were randomly divided into a training group (64 samples) and an internal validation group (64 samples) at one time, and the tumor samples of GEO served as two external validation groups (99 samples, 374 samples). According to the expression levels of survival-associated metabolic genes, we divided all TCGA tumor samples into high, medium and low metabolism groups, and evaluated the immune cell activity in the tumor microenvironment of the three metabolism groups by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. Finally, we examined the mutations and prognostic effects of each model gene. Results: Four metabolism-related genes were screened and applied to construct a prognostic model for AML, giving excellent results. As for the area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the training group was up to 0.902 (1-year), 0.81 (3-year), and 0.877 (5-year); and the internal and external validation groups also met the expected standards, showing high potency in predicting patient outcome. Univariate and multivariate prognostic analyses indicated that the riskScore obtained from our prognostic model was an independent prognostic factor. ssGSEA analysis revealed the high metabolism group had higher immune activity. Single and multiple gene survival analysis validated that each model gene had significant effects on the overall survival of AML patients. Conclusions: In our study, a high-efficiency prognostic prediction model was built and validated for AML patients. The results showed that metabolism-related genes could become potential prognostic biomarkers for AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, Ma, Wang, Shi and Hu.']","['Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Ma, Shengling', 'Wang, Moran', 'Shi, Wei', 'Hu, Yu']","['Zhang Y', 'Ma S', 'Wang M', 'Shi W', 'Hu Y']","['Department of Oncology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7552924,,2020/10/30 06:00,2020/10/30 06:01,['2020/10/29 05:53'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.578933 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 29;10:578933. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.578933. eCollection 2020.,578933,,20200929,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bioinformatic analysis', 'metabolism', 'prognosis', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the pharmacological effects of the novel highly specific cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitor LDC526 and its clinically used derivate atuveciclib employing primary T-PLL cells in an ex vivo drug sensitivity testing platform. Importantly, all T-PLL samples were sensitive to CDK9 inhibition at submicromolar concentrations, while conventional cytotoxic drugs were found to be largely ineffective. At the cellular level LDC526 inhibited the phosphorylation at serine 2 of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain resulting in decreased de novo RNA transcription. LDC526 induced apoptotic leukemic cell death through down-regulating MYC and MCL1 both at the mRNA and protein level. Microarray-based transcriptomic profiling revealed that genes down-modulated in response to CDK9 inhibition were enriched for MYC and JAK-STAT targets. By contrast, CDK9 inhibition increased the expression of the tumor suppressor FBXW7, which may contribute to decreased MYC and MCL1 protein levels.

However, the majority of these variants affect noncoding regions, making their mechanisms difficult to hypothesize and hindering the translation of these insights into patient benefits. Fueled by unprecedented progress in next-generation sequencing and computational integrative analysis, studies have started applying combinations of epigenetic, genome architecture, and functional assays to bridge the gap between noncoding variants and blood cancer. These complementary tools have not only allowed us to understand the potential malignant role of these variants but also to differentiate key variants, cell-types, and conditions from misleading ones.

However, data on the epidemiology and risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with newly diagnosed APL are lacking. This study determined the incidence rate of AKI during induction chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed APL and the risk factors for AKI. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients with newly diagnosed APL in the Shonan Kamakura General Hospital between April 2004 and April 2020. Data of 27 patients with newly diagnosed APL were analyzed. The patients were classified as no AKI and AKI stages 1, 2 or 3. Results: The incidence rate of AKI during induction chemotherapy was 40% (11/27). Among patients who developed AKI, four patients experienced AKI stage 3, and two patients required renal replacement therapy. No significant differences were found in the white blood cell count and baseline renal function between the groups; however, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels upon admission were significantly higher in patients with AKI than in patients without AKI. Among patients who developed AKI, in hospital mortality at 90 days was 36% (4/11), which was significantly higher than among patients without AKI (p = 0.02). Patients who developed AKI were administered vancomycin more frequently, while almost all blood culture results were negative. Conclusion: Incidence of AKI development in patients with newly diagnosed APL during induction chemotherapy was approximately 40%. Moreover, patients who developed AKI tended to be administered vancomycin more frequently. Unnecessary use of vancomycin should be avoided in patients with newly diagnosed APL, and using alternative non-nephrotoxic drugs should be considered for patients at risk of AKI.",['(c) 2020 Kamio et al.'],"['Kamio, Tadashi', 'Koyama, Hiroshi', 'Fukaguchi, Kiyomitsu', 'Sato, Shuku', 'Kamata, Wataru', 'Okada, Satomi', 'Tamai, Yotaro']","['Kamio T', 'Koyama H', 'Fukaguchi K', 'Sato S', 'Kamata W', 'Okada S', 'Tamai Y']","['Division of Critical Care, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.', 'Division of Critical Care, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.', 'Division of Critical Care, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247-8533, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,PMC7574904,['The authors report that they have no conflict of interest.'],2020/10/30 06:00,2020/10/30 06:01,['2020/10/29 05:50'],"['2020/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S278270 [doi]', '278270 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2020 Oct 15;11:363-369. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S278270. eCollection 2020.,363-369,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2262-1898', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5887-6097']",20201015,['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'incidence rate', 'induction chemotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies revealed a significant impact of MPV on the course and prognosis of many diseases, including some types of cancer, as well as on the incidence of atrial fibrillation and bleeding. The study aimed to perform a retrospective analysis of MPV in terms of time to first treatment (TTFT) and to determine its prognostic value in the group of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Moreover, the study includes a retrospective analysis of platelet parameters in patients treated with ibrutinib concerning bleeding and atrial fibrillation. Patients and Methods: The study included 523 patients with CLL, for 344 the most important cytogenetic aberrations were reported. The Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, Kaplan-Meier, chi-squared, logrank tests and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to analyze collected data. Results: The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify optimal cut-off value for MPV. The analysis of survival curves showed that in the group of patients with higher values of MPV TTFT was significantly longer than in the group with lower MPV (17.9 vs 36 months, p=0.0015, cut-off value for MPV= 10.4 fl). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model low MPV, the presence of del11q and del13q provided independent prognostic value for TTFT (HR=0.69, 95%-CI, 0.5293 to 0.9081; p=0.0078; HR=1.76, 95%-CI, 1.3000 to 2.3882, p=0.0003, HR=0.74, 95%-Cl, 0.5674 to 0.9588, p=0.0229, respectively). In the group treated with ibrutinib, 59 patients had no significant correlation between MPV level and the incidence of therapy complications, although in the group of patients with low MPV there was a tendency for more frequent occurrence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.259). Conclusion: Low MPV values are associated with unfavorable prognosis and might represent a novel, independent prognostic factor in CLL.",['(c) 2020 Masternak et al.'],"['Masternak, Marta', 'Pula, Bartosz', 'Knap, Joanna', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Wdowiak, Kamil', 'Grosicki, Sebastian', 'Kozlowska, Izabela', 'Kazmierczak, Marta', 'Labedz, Anna', 'Szukalski, Lukasz', 'Wisniewski, Kamil', 'Subocz, Edyta', 'Halka, Janusz', 'Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Hus, Marek', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Masternak M', 'Pula B', 'Knap J', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Wdowiak K', 'Grosicki S', 'Kozlowska I', 'Kazmierczak M', 'Labedz A', 'Szukalski L', 'Wisniewski K', 'Subocz E', 'Halka J', 'Szymczyk A', 'Hus M', 'Jamroziak K', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Cancer Prevention in Chorzow, Faculty of Health Sciences in Bytom, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Cancer Prevention, Municipal Hospital in Chorzow, Chorzow, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Cancer Prevention, Municipal Hospital in Chorzow, Chorzow, Poland.', ""Department of Hematology, Rydrygier's Hospital in Cracow, Cracow, Poland."", 'Department of Hematology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', ""Department of Hematology, Military Institute of Medicine, Warsaw, Poland; Clinical Department of Hematology, Independent Public Healthcare Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration with Warmia-Mazury Region's Oncology Centre in Olsztyn, Olsztyn, Poland."", ""Clinical Department of Hematology, Independent Public Healthcare Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration with Warmia-Mazury Region's Oncology Centre in Olsztyn, Olsztyn, Poland."", ""Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland; Hematology Department, St John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland."", 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', ""Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland; Hematology Department, St John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC7567945,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2020/10/30 06:00,2020/10/30 06:01,['2020/10/29 05:49'],"['2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S246385 [doi]', '246385 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Oct 12;12:9977-9985. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S246385. eCollection 2020.,9977-9985,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5947-7610', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0116-5002', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3157-8641', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5626-1750', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4562-6264', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8176-4245', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2644-1050', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1476-9158', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4164-9343']",20201012,['NOTNLM'],"['MPV', 'TTFT', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutation and CD34 expression levels were assessed in the bone marrow (BM) aspirates of 153 de novo AML patients. Data were correlated with relevant clinic-pathological features of the patients, response to treatment, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall free survival (OS) rates. Results: FLT3-ITD mutation was detected in 27/153 (17.6%) AML patients (P=0.001), and CD34 was expressed in 83/153 (54.2%) patients (P=0.293) compared to those with wild FLT3 and CD34(-) expression, respectively. Patients with FLT3-ITD mutation showed increased peripheral blood and BM blast cells, abnormal cytogenetics, poor DFS and OS compared to those with wild FLT3 (P=0.013, P<0.001, P=0.010, P=0.008 and P=0.004, respectively), while there was no significant association with response to treatment (P=0.081). There was no significant association between CD34 expression and response to treatment, DFS, and OS (P>0.05). FLT3-ITD mutation and FAB subtypes were independent prognostic factors for DFS. Older age >/=39 years, HB <7 mg/dL PB blast >/=54%, and FLT3-ITD mutation were independent prognostic factors for poor OS in AML patients. The presence of both FLT3-ITD mutation and CD34 expression associated significantly with resistance to therapy (P=0.024), short DFS and OS rates (P=0.006, P=0.037, respectively).

The fast growth of tumor and high rates of metastasis still lead to a poor prognosis of cervical cancer patients. It is urgent to clarify the mechanism and identify predictive biomarkers for the treatment of cervical cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been identified in cervical cancer and are related to malignant phenotypes of cervical cancer cells. However, the roles and mechanism of LncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia (DLEU2) in the tumorigenesis and progression of cervical cancer remain unknown. Materials and Methods: qPCR was performed to analyze the expression of DLEU2, Cyclin D1, CDK4, Bax, Bcl2 and mi-128-3p. Western blot was performed to detect the cell cycle hallmarks expression. CCK8 was used to examine cell proliferation. Cellular apoptosis was analyzed by Hoechst 33,258 staining and AV/PI staining with flow cytometry. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The xenograft model in nude mice was used to elucidate the function of DLEU2 in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were proceeded to clarify whether miR-128-3p directly binds with lncRNA DLEU2. Pulldown assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay were used for exploring the relationship between DLEU2 and miR-128-3p. Results: We demonstrated that DLEU2 was upregulated in cervical cancer tumor tissues. Downregulation of DLEU2 inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase of cervical cancer cells in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Further, LncRNA DLEU2 is one of the targets of miR-128-3p. miR-128-3p inhibitor abrogated the cell proliferation suppressed by knockdown of DLEU2, apoptosis induced by knockdown of DLEU2 and reversed the expression of cell cycle hallmarks regulated by knockdown of DLEU2. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggested knockdown of DLEU2 inhibited cervical cancer progression via targeting miR-128-3p.",['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Bofei', 'Hang, Jing', 'Li, Weiling', 'Yuan, Wanqiong']","['Wang B', 'Hang J', 'Li W', 'Yuan W']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weifang NO.2 People's Hospital."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University Third Hospital, Key Laboratory of Assisted Reproduction, Ministry of Education, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Reproductive Endocrinology and Assisted Reproduction, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Affiliated Yixing Hospital of Jiangsu University, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Spinal Disease, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC7553767,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest for this work.'],2020/10/30 06:00,2020/10/30 06:01,['2020/10/29 05:49'],"['2020/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S272292 [doi]', '272292 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Oct 9;13:10173-10184. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S272292. eCollection 2020.,10173-10184,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0334-6467'],20201009,['NOTNLM'],"['DLEU2', 'LncRNAs', 'cervical cancer', 'miR-128-3p', 'tumor growth']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are produced actively in tumor cells, which are released and utilized to facilitate tumor growth. Their characteristics enable them to assist major cancer hallmarks, leveraged by cancer cells in fostering cancer growth and spread while implementing ways to escape elimination from the host environment. This review updates on the latest progress on the roles of cancer-derived exosomes, of 30-100 nm in size, in deregulating paracrine trafficking in the tumor microenvironment and circulation. Thus, exosomes are being exploited in diagnostic biomarker development, with its potential in clinical applications as therapeutic targets utilized in exosome-based nanoparticle drug delivery strategies for cancer therapy. Ongoing studies were retrieved from PubMed((R)) and Scopus database and ClinicalTrials.gov registry for review, highlighting how cancer cells from entirely different cell lines rely on genetic information carried by their exosomes for homotypic and heterotypic intercellular communications in the microenvironment to favor proliferation and invasion, while establishing a pre-metastatic niche in welcoming cancer cells' arrival. We will elaborate on the trafficking of tumor-derived exosomes in fostering cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in hematopoietic (leukemia and myeloma), epithelial (breast cancer), and mesenchymal (soft tissue sarcoma and osteosarcoma) cancers. Cancer-derived exosomal trafficking is observed in several types of liquid or solid tumors, confirming their role as cancer hallmark enabler. Their enriched genetic signals arising from their characteristic DNA, RNA, microRNA, and lncRNA, along with specific gene expression profiles, protein, or lipid composition carried by the exosomal cargo shed into blood, saliva, urine, ascites, and cervicovaginal lavage, are being studied as a diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive cancer biomarker.

To the best of our knowledge, the toxicity of ZnO NPs against human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cell line) has not been studied using transcriptomics approach. Objective: The goals of this study were to evaluate the capability of ZnO NPs to induce apoptosis in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cells) and to investigate the putative mechanisms of action. Methods: We used viability assay and flowcytometry coupled with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide to investigate the toxicity of ZnO NPs on K562 cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Next we utilized a DNA microarray-based transcriptomics approach to characterize the ZnO NPs-induced changes in the transcriptome of K562 cells. Results: ZnO NPs exerted a selective toxicity (mainly by apoptosis) on the leukemic cells (p</=0.005) and altered their transcriptome; 429 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with fold change (FC)>/=4 and p</=0.008 with corrected p</=0.05 were identified in K562 cells post treatment with ZnO NPs. The over-expressed genes were implicated in ""response to zinc"", ""response to toxic substance"" and ""negative regulation of growth"" (corrected p</=0.05). In contrast, the repressed genes positively regulated ""cell proliferation"", ""cell migration"", ""cell adhesion"", ""receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT"" and ""phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling"" (corrected p</=0.05). Lowering the FC to >/=1.5 with p</=0.05 and corrected p</=0.1 showed that ZnO NPs over-expressed the anti-oxidant defense system, drove K562 cells to undergo mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, and targeted NF-kappaB pathway. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings support the earlier studies that reported anti-cancer activity of ZnO NPs and revealed possible molecular mechanisms employed by ZnO NPs to induce apoptosis in K562 cells.",['(c) 2020 Alsagaby et al.'],"['Alsagaby, Suliman A', 'Vijayakumar, Rajendran', 'Premanathan, Mariappan', 'Mickymaray, Suresh', 'Alturaiki, Wael', 'Al-Baradie, Raid S', 'AlGhamdi, Saleh', 'Aziz, Mohammad A', 'Alhumaydhi, Fahad A', 'Alzahrani, Faisal A', 'Alwashmi, Ameen S', 'Al Abdulmonem, Waleed', 'Alharbi, Naif Khalaf', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Alsagaby SA', 'Vijayakumar R', 'Premanathan M', 'Mickymaray S', 'Alturaiki W', 'Al-Baradie RS', 'AlGhamdi S', 'Aziz MA', 'Alhumaydhi FA', 'Alzahrani FA', 'Alwashmi AS', 'Al Abdulmonem W', 'Alharbi NK', 'Pepper C']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11932, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biology, College of Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11932, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biology, College of Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11932, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biology, College of Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11932, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11932, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11932, Saudi Arabia.', 'Clinical Research Department, Research Center, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia.', 'Colorectal Cancer Research Program, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratories, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Buraydah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medical Laboratories, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Buraydah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Qassim University, Buraidah, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Research, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'SOI2LOH54Z (Zinc Oxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Nanoparticles', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Zinc Oxide/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC7568638,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest for this work.'],2020/10/30 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/10/29 05:48'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:48 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S261636 [doi]', '261636 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2020 Oct 13;15:7901-7921. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S261636. eCollection 2020.,7901-7921,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2242-5638', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3234-4743', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2231-8434', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0545-2407', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0798-5063', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0151-8309', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0441-4000', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7290-8945', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2984-9262', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3603-8839']",20201013,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'ZnO NPs', 'apoptosis', 'transcriptomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bulk molecular profiling has suggested that mutations are acquired in a stepwise fashion: mutant genes with high variant allele frequencies appear early in leukaemogenesis, and mutations with lower variant allele frequencies are thought to be acquired later(1-3). Although bulk sequencing can provide information about leukaemia biology and prognosis, it cannot distinguish which mutations occur in the same clone(s), accurately measure clonal complexity, or definitively elucidate the order of mutations. To delineate the clonal framework of myeloid malignancies, we performed single-cell mutational profiling on 146 samples from 123 patients. Here we show that AML is dominated by a small number of clones, which frequently harbour co-occurring mutations in epigenetic regulators. Conversely, mutations in signalling genes often occur more than once in distinct subclones, consistent with increasing clonal diversity.

The introduction of intensive chemotherapy treatments together with patient stratification and supportive therapy has resulted in a moderate improvement in patient prognosis. However, overall survival rates remain unacceptably poor, with only 65% of patients surviving longer than 5 years. Recently age-specific differences in AML have been identified, highlighting the need for tailored treatments for paediatric patients. Combination therapies have the potential to improve patient prognosis, while minimising harmful side-effects. In the laboratory setting, identifying key combinations from large drug libraries can be resource-intensive, prohibiting discovery and translation into the clinic. To minimise redundancy and maximise discovery, we undertook a multiplex screen of 80 apoptotic-inducing agents in paediatric AML pre-clinical models. The screen was designed using an all-pairs testing algorithm, which ensured that all pairs of compounds could be tested, while minimising the number of wells used. We identified a combination of ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor and Purvalanol A, a CDK inhibitor, as a potential targeted therapy for AML patients with an MLL rearrangement and an FLT3-ITD. Our approach has the potential to reduce resource-intensity and time associated with the identification of novel combination therapies.",,"['Lappin, Katrina M', 'Davis, Lindsay', 'Matchett, Kyle B', 'Ge, Yubin', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Blayney, Jaine K']","['Lappin KM', 'Davis L', 'Matchett KB', 'Ge Y', 'Mills KI', 'Blayney JK']","[""Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7AE, UK.

Such heterogeneity is associated with a number of markers, including TP53 gene inactivation. While TP53 gene alterations determine resistance to chemotherapy, it is not clear whether they can influence early disease progression. To clarify this issue, TP53 mutations and deletions of the corresponding locus [del(17p)] were evaluated in 469 cases from the O-CLL1 observational study that recruited a cohort of clinically and molecularly characterised Binet stage A patients. Twenty-four cases harboured somatic TP53 mutations [accompanied by del(17p) in 9 cases], 2 patients had del(17p) only, and 5 patients had TP53 germ-line variants. While del(17p) with or without TP53 mutations was capable of significantly predicting the time to first treatment, a reliable measure of disease progression, TP53 mutations were not. This was true for cases with high or low variant allele frequency. The lack of predictive ability was independent of the functional features of the mutant P53 protein in terms of transactivation and dominant negative potential. TP53 mutations alone were more frequent in patients with mutated IGHV genes, whereas del(17p) was associated with the presence of adverse prognostic factors, including CD38 positivity, unmutated-IGHV gene status, and NOTCH1 mutations.",,"['Monti, Paola', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'De Luca, Giuseppa', 'Menichini, Paola', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Matis, Serena', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Speciale, Andrea', 'Barbieri, Marzia', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Zupo, Simonetta', 'Dono, Mariella', 'Ibatici, Adalberto', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Fais, Franco', 'Fronza, Gilberto', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Monti P', 'Lionetti M', 'De Luca G', 'Menichini P', 'Recchia AG', 'Matis S', 'Colombo M', 'Fabris S', 'Speciale A', 'Barbieri M', 'Gentile M', 'Zupo S', 'Dono M', 'Ibatici A', 'Neri A', 'Ferrarini M', 'Fais F', 'Fronza G', 'Cutrona G', 'Morabito F']","['Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, 20122, Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Biotechnology Research Unit, Aprigliano, A.O./ASP of Cosenza, 87100, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy."", 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology Unit, Department of Onco-Hematology, A.O. of Cosenza, 87100, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Diagnostic Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, 20122, Milan, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Biotechnology Research Unit, Aprigliano, A.O./ASP of Cosenza, 87100, Cosenza, Italy. f.morabito53@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. f.morabito53@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prospective Studies', '*Time-to-Treatment']",PMC7595214,,2020/10/30 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/10/29 05:45'],"['2020/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-75364-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-75364-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Oct 28;10(1):18427. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-75364-3.,18427,,20201028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that T cells of patients relapsing with AML after allo-HCT exhibited reduced glycolysis and interferon-gamma production. Functional studies in multiple mouse models of leukemia showed that leukemia-derived lactic acid (LA) interfered with T cell glycolysis and proliferation. Mechanistically, LA reduced intracellular pH in T cells, led to lower transcription of glycolysis-related enzymes, and decreased activity of essential metabolic pathways. Metabolic reprogramming by sodium bicarbonate (NaBi) reversed the LA-induced low intracellular pH, restored metabolite concentrations, led to incorporation of LA into the tricarboxylic acid cycle as an additional energy source, and enhanced graft-versus-leukemia activity of murine and human T cells. NaBi treatment of post-allo-HCT patients with relapsed AML improved metabolic fitness and interferon-gamma production in T cells. Overall, we show that metabolic reprogramming of donor T cells is a pharmacological strategy for patients with relapsed AML after allo-HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C) has shown a potential anti-cancer therapeutic activity in several cancers. However, the anti-cancer effects of ascorbic acid on CLL B-cells have not been extensively studied. We aimed in this study to evaluate the in vitro therapeutic activity using clinically relevant conditions. METHODS: Primary CLL B-cells and two CLL cell lines were exposed to a dose that is clinically achievable by AA oral administration (250 muM), and cell death and potential mechanisms were assessed. The role of the protective CLL microenvironment was studied. Synergistic interaction between AA and CLL approved drugs (Ibrutinib, Idelalisib and Venetoclax) was also evaluated. RESULTS: Ascorbic acid is cytotoxic for CLL B-cells at low dose (250 muM) but spares healthy B-cells. Ascorbic-acid-induced cytotoxicity involved pro-oxidant damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species in the extracellular media and in CLL cells, and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. We also found that AA treatment overcame the supportive survival effect provided by microenvironment including bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, T-cell cues (CD40L + IL-4), cytokines and hypoxia. Our data suggest that resistance to AA could be mediated by the expression of the enzyme catalase in some CLL samples and by the glucose metabolite pyruvate. We also demonstrated that AA synergistically potentiates the cytotoxicity of targeted therapies used in or being developed for CLL. CONCLUSION: These preclinical results point to AA as an adjuvant therapy with potential to further improve CLL treatments in combination with targeted therapies.",,"['Darwiche, Walaa', 'Gomila, Cathy', 'Ouled-Haddou, Hakim', 'Naudot, Marie', 'Doualle, Cecile', 'Morel, Pierre', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Garcon, Loic', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Ghamlouch, Hussein']","['Darwiche W', 'Gomila C', 'Ouled-Haddou H', 'Naudot M', 'Doualle C', 'Morel P', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Garcon L', 'Marolleau JP', 'Ghamlouch H']","['EA 4666, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France. walaa.darwiche@u-picardie.fr.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Amiens Picardie, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France. walaa.darwiche@u-picardie.fr."", 'EA 4666, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France.', 'EA 4666, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France.', 'EA 7516, CHIMERE, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France.', 'INSERM U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Amiens Picardie, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France."", 'INSERM U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', ""Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Sorbonne Universite, APHP, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Paris, France."", 'EA 4666, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France.', ""Service d'hematologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Amiens Picardie, Amiens, France."", 'EA 4666, HEMATIM, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne, D408, 80054, Amiens Cedex, France.

The tendency of tumor development following BLV infection in certain cow families and bull lines has previously been described. We therefore hypothesized the existence of a genetic component which differentiates cattle susceptibility to the disease. RESULTS: We analyzed routinely collected large-scale data including postmortem inspection data, which were combined with pedigree information and epidemiological data of BLV infection. A total of 6,022 postmortem inspection records of Holstein cattle, raised on 226 farms served by a regional abattoir over 10 years from 2004 to 2015, were analyzed for associations between sire information and EBL development. We then identified statistically the relative susceptibility to EBL development for the progeny of specific sires and paternal grandsires (PGSs). The heritability of EBL development was calculated as 0.19. Similarly, proviral loads (PVLs) of progeny from identified sires and PGSs were analyzed, but no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that because EBL development in our Holstein population is, at least in part, influenced by genetic factors independent of PVL levels, genetic improvement for lower incidence of EBL development in cattle notwithstanding BLV infection is possible.",,"['Inagaki, Yasuko', 'Kobayashi, Tomoko', 'Suda, Yoshihito', 'Kusama, Kazuya', 'Imakawa, Kazuhiko']","['Inagaki Y', 'Kobayashi T', 'Suda Y', 'Kusama K', 'Imakawa K']","['Laboratory of Animal Health, Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture, 243-0034, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Animal Health, Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture, 243-0034, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Food, Agriculture and Environment, Miyagi University, 982-0215, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Endocrine Pharmacology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 192-0392, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Reproduction, Research Institute of Agriculture, Tokai University, 862-8652, Kumamoto, Japan. ik459102@tsc.u-tokai.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*genetics/virology', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Proviruses', 'Viral Load/veterinary']",PMC7594299,,2020/10/30 06:00,2021/05/12 06:00,['2020/10/29 05:29'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 05:29 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-020-02625-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-020-02625-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2020 Oct 28;16(1):407. doi: 10.1186/s12917-020-02625-8.,407,,20201028,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Enzootic bovine leukosis', 'Holstein cattle', 'heritability']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to develop the autotrophic and heterotrophic culture of Tetraselmis suecica (Kylin) Butcher in order to increase EPS production and to characterize its antioxidant activity and cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. The adaptation of autotrophic to heterotrophic culture was carried out by progressively reducing the photoperiod and adding glucose. EPS extraction and purification were performed. EPS were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antioxidant capacity of EPS was analyzed by the 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) method, and the antitumor capacity was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, showing high activity on human leukemia, breast and lung cancer cell lines. Although total EPS showed no cytotoxicity, acidic EPS showed cytotoxicity over the gingival fibroblasts cell line. Heterotrophic culture has advantages over autotrophic, such as increasing EPS yield, higher antioxidant capacity of the EPS and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first probe that T. suecica EPS have cytotoxic effects on tumor cells; therefore, they could offer greater advantages as possible natural nutraceuticals for the pharmaceutical industry.",,"['Parra-Riofrio, Geovanna', 'Garcia-Marquez, Jorge', 'Casas-Arrojo, Virginia', 'Uribe-Tapia, Eduardo', 'Abdala-Diaz, Roberto Teofilo']","['Parra-Riofrio G', 'Garcia-Marquez J', 'Casas-Arrojo V', 'Uribe-Tapia E', 'Abdala-Diaz RT']","['Doctorado en Acuicultura.

Here we investigate the possible interference of olaparib with daunorubicin (Daun) metabolism, mediated by carbonyl-reducing enzymes (CREs), which play a significant role in the resistance of cancer cells to anthracyclines. Incubation experiments with the most active recombinant CREs showed that olaparib is a potent inhibitor of the aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) enzyme. Subsequent inhibitory assays in the AKR1C3-overexpressing cellular model transfected human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells, demonstrating that olaparib significantly inhibits AKR1C3 at the intracellular level. Consequently, molecular docking studies have supported these findings and identified the possible molecular background of the interaction. Drug combination experiments in HCT116, human liver carcinoma HepG2, and leukemic KG1alpha cell lines showed that this observed interaction can be exploited for the synergistic enhancement of Daun's antiproliferative effect. Finally, we showed that olaparib had no significant effect on the mRNA expression of AKR1C3 in HepG2 and KG1alpha cells.

Two potent lead compounds (DHN-II-84 and DHN-III-14) identified from this screening were found to be analogs of the natural product makaluvamine. We further characterized the antitumor activities of these two compounds using pulmonary (H727), thyroid (MZ-CRC-1) and pancreatic (BON) neuroendocrine tumor cell lines. Flow cytometry showed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in all cell lines. Induction of apoptosis with these compounds was also supported by the decrease in myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) detected by Western blot. Compound treatment decreased NET markers chromogranin A (CgA) and achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the gene expression analysis showed that the compound treatment reduced c-Kit proto-oncogene expression in the NET cell lines. Induction of apoptosis could also have been caused by the inhibition of c-Kit expression, in addition to the known mechanisms such as damage of DNA by topoisomerase II inhibition for this class of compounds. In summary, makaluvamine analogs DHN-II-84 and DHN-III-14 induced apoptosis, decreased neuroendocrine tumor markers, and showed promising antitumor activity in pulmonary, thyroid, and pancreatic NET cell lines, and hold potential to be developed as an effective treatment to combat neuroendocrine tumors.",,"['Aburjania, Zviadi', 'Whitt, Jason D', 'Jang, Samuel', 'Nadkarni, Dwayaja H', 'Chen, Herbert', 'Rose, J Bart', 'Velu, Sadanandan E', 'Jaskula-Sztul, Renata']","['Aburjania Z', 'Whitt JD', 'Jang S', 'Nadkarni DH', 'Chen H', 'Rose JB', 'Velu SE', 'Jaskula-Sztul R']","['Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue S., Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue S., Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue S., Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 901 14th Street S., Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue S., Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', ""O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1720 2nd Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."", 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue S., Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 901 14th Street S., Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', ""O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1720 2nd Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."", 'Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1824 6th Avenue S., Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.', ""O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1720 2nd Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R21CA226491/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R03DE025058/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC7663375,,2020/10/30 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/10/29 01:03'],"['2020/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25214940 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25214940 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Oct 26;25(21). pii: molecules25214940. doi: 10.3390/molecules25214940.,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0342-2378'],20201026,['NOTNLM'],"['NET', 'alkaloid', 'cancer', 'makaluvamine', 'neuroendocrine', 'therapeutic', 'tumor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, somatic mutagenesis, a driving force in cancer development, has not been generally considered as an important factor in cardiovascular disease pathology. Recent studies demonstrated that during normal aging, somatic mutagenesis occurs in blood cells, often resulting in expansion of mutant clones that dominate hematopoiesis at advanced age. This clonal hematopoiesis is primarily associated with mutations in certain leukemia-related driver genes and, being by itself relatively benign, not only increases the risks of subsequent malignant hematopoietic transformation, but, unexpectedly, has a significant impact on progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.

Key challenges include working with noisy data and dealing with a higher number of genes than samples. Although a number of different methods have been proposed to infer the structure of a GRN, there are large discrepancies among the different inference algorithms they adopt, rendering their meaningful comparison challenging. In this study, we used two methods, namely the MIDER (Mutual Information Distance and Entropy Reduction) and the PLSNET (Partial least square based feature selection) methods, to infer the structure of a GRN directly from data and computationally validated our results. Both methods were applied to different gene expression datasets resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) studies. For each case, gene regulators were successfully identified. For example, for the case of the IBD dataset, the UGT1A family genes were identified as key regulators while upon analysing the PDAC dataset, the SULF1 and THBS2 genes were depicted. We further demonstrate that an ensemble-based approach, that combines the output of the MIDER and PLSNET algorithms, can infer the structure of a GRN from data with higher accuracy. We have also estimated the number of the samples required for potential future validation studies. Here, we presented our proposed analysis framework that caters not only to candidate regulator genes prediction for potential validation experiments but also an estimation of the number of samples required for these experiments.",,"['Aziz, Furqan', 'Acharjee, Animesh', 'Williams, John A', 'Russ, Dominic', 'Bravo-Merodio, Laura', 'Gkoutos, Georgios V']","['Aziz F', 'Acharjee A', 'Williams JA', 'Russ D', 'Bravo-Merodio L', 'Gkoutos GV']","['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2WB, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Harwell Institute, Harwell Campus, Oxfordshire OX11 0RD, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre, University Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2WB, UK.', 'MRC Health Data Research UK (HDR UK), Midlands B15 2TT, UK.', 'NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2WB, UK.']",['eng'],['NA/NIHR Surgical Reconstruction Microbiology Research Centre'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Thrombospondins)', '0 (thrombospondin 2)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UGT1A1 enzyme)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (SULF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.8.2.- (Sulfotransferases)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*genetics', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Sulfotransferases/genetics', 'Thrombospondins/genetics']",PMC7660606,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2020/10/30 06:00,2021/03/02 06:00,['2020/10/29 01:03'],"['2020/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/29 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21217886 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21217886 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Oct 23;21(21). pii: ijms21217886. doi: 10.3390/ijms21217886.,,,20201023,['NOTNLM'],"['causal modelling', 'experimental design', 'gene regulatory network', 'omics integration']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with anti-miR-NC group (0.99+/-0.07, 0.98+/-0.05), the luciferase activity of DLEU1-WT (1.34+/-0.11) and RANBP2-WT (1.39 +/-0.13) in anti-miR-513a-5p group was significantly increased (P<0.05). Simultaneous overexpression of pcDNA-DLEU1 and miR-513a-5p in GHINK-1 cells significantly reduced the apoptosis rate (11.34+/-1.03 vs 8.51+/-0.69, P<0.05). Simultaneous overexpression of miR-513a-5p and RANBP2 in GHINK-1 cells significantly reduced the apoptosis rate (9.96+/-0.72 vs 15.94+/-1.00, P<0.05). Conclusions: The long-chain non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DLEU1 can promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of nephroblastoma cells.

Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression level of PBX1 in lung cancer tissues and adjacent tissues. The correlation between PBX1 expression level and clinical pathological parameters of patients were analyzed. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level of PBX1 in human lung cancer cell lines, including A549, SPC-A1, SK-MES-1 and H1299. A549 cells were transfected with blank control (blank group), negative control (NC group) or PBX1 small interfering RNA (siRNA group), respectively. The cells apoptosis and ROS content were detected by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of PBX1, STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and survivin in each group were detected by western blot. Results: The expression level of PBX1 mRNA in lung cancer was (2.36+/-0.23), significantly higher than (1.02+/-0.15) in paracancerous tissues (P<0.05). The expression level of PBX1 was correlated with lung cancer differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05). The expression levels of PBX1 in human lung cancer cells A549, SPC-A1, SK-MES-1 and H1299 were (0.454+/-0.038), (0.403+/-0.034), (0.311+/-0.028) and (0.377+/-0.035), respectively, significantly higher than (0.041+/-0.007) of human normal lung cells MRC-5 (P<0.05). The expression level of PBX1 protein in A549 cells transfected with PBX1 siRNA was (0.082+/-0.010), significantly lower than (0.704+/-0.065) of the blank group (P<0.05). The apoptosis rate and ROS content of siPBX1 group were (30.78+/-3.64)% and (51.55+/-5.03), respectively, significantly higher than (3.92+/-0.27)% and (22.36+/-1.31) of blank group (P<0.05).

P-ATGs (5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) were administrated for 3 to 5 days, and then 5mg/kg was sequentially administrated, QOD to BIW. Etanercepts were administrated 25 mg, twice a week (12.5 mg, BIW for pediatric patients) . Results: Among the 35 patients with grade / aGVHD, 21 were males and 14 females, with a median age of 10 (3-54) years. A total of 19 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 13 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 of severe aplastic anemia, 1 of myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 of mixed phenotypic acute leukemia were noted. The overall response (OR) rate of P-ATG with etanercept was 85.7% (30/35) , with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates of 34.3% (12/35) and 51.4% (18/35) , respectively, on day 28. The OR rate of grade aGVHD group was higher than of grade IV aGVHD group [100% (19/19) vs. 68.8% (11/16) , P=0.004]. On day 56, the OR rate became 77.2% (27/35) , with CR and PR rates of 62.9% (22/35) and 14.3% (5/35) , respectively. The OR rate of grade aGVHD group was also higher than of grade aGVHD group [89.5% (17/19) vs. 62.5% (10/16) , P=0.009]. Thirty-five patients had no adverse effects such as fever, chills, and rash during the P-ATG infusion, and no obvious liver and kidney function damage was observed after treatment. The main treatment-related complication was infection. The reactivation rates of CMV and EBV were 77.1% (27/35) and 22.9% (8/35) , respectively, and the bacterial infection rate was 48.6% (17/35) . With a median follow-up time of 13 (1-55) months after HSCT, the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were (68.1+/-8.0) % and (64.3+/-8.4) % , respectively. The 1-year OS rate of grade aGVHD group was superior to grade aGVHD group [ (84.2+/-8.4) % vs. (47.6+/-13.1) % , chi(2)=3.38, P=0.05].

Methods: From January 1, 2016, to February 1, 2020, 103 newly diagnosed AML patients in Henan Provincial People's Hospital who simultaneously underwent bone marrow biopsy examination were included. They were divided into the AML-MF group (MF grades 1-3) and the AML without MF group (MF grade 0) , and the clinical features, gene alterations, chemotherapy efficacy, and prognosis were compared between the two groups retrospectively. Results: 1 in circleMF was confirmed in 44.7% of AML patients (46/103) , of which 84.8% (39/46) were MF-1 and 15.2% (7/46) were MF-2/3, while MF was not confirmed in 55.3% (57/103) of AML patients. The median of WBC in the AML-MF group was significantly higher than in the AML without MF group [11.205 (0.69-191.82) x10(9)/L vs 4.64 (0.18-95.10) x10(9)/L, P=0.024].

The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of improving the developmental competence of prepubertal oocytes by supplementing the oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) medium with antioxidants and cytokines. Effects of two antioxidants, melatonin and sericin, were first examined. The results showed that melatonin had no significant beneficial roles on the lamb oocyte development, while 0.5% sericin supplemented during IVM significantly increased the blastocyst rate of lamb oocytes (46.5% vs 19.2% in control, P < 0.05). Next, effects of two kinds of combined supplements, insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) and fibroblast growth factor 2(FGF2)-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-insulin-like growth factor1 (IGF1)(FLI) were tested. The results indicated that addition of FLI, but not ITS, in the IVM medium, significantly improved the blastocyst development of lamb oocytes (43.9% in FLI group vs 21.6% in control, P < 0.05). Further comparison showed that the developmental competence of oocytes was not significantly different among supplementation with sericin or FLI alone or both, all of which generated similar outcomes of blastocyst yield to the supplementation with adult follicular fluid.

Abnormal activation of SHP2 has been shown to contribute to a variety of human diseases, including Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), Noonan syndrome and tumors. Thus, the SHP2 inhibitors have important therapeutic value. Here, based on the compound PubChem CID 8,478,960 (IC50 = 45.01 muM), a series of thiophene [2,3-d] pyrimidine derivatives (IC50 = 0.4-37.87 muM) were discovered as novel and efficient inhibitors of SHP2 through powerful ""core hopping"" and CDOCKER technology. Furthermore, the SHP2-PTP phosphatase activity assay indicated that Comp#5 (IC50 = 0.4 muM) was the most active SHP2 inhibitor. Subsequently, the effects of Comp#5 on the structure and function of SHP2 were investigated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and post-kinetic analysis. The result indicated that Comp#5 enhanced the interaction of residues THR357, ARG362, LYS366, PRO424, CYS459, SER460, ALA461, ILE463, ARG465, THR507 and GLN510 with the surrounding residues, improving the stability of the catalytic active region and the entrance of catalytic active region. In particular, the Comp#5 conjugated with residue ARG362, elevating the efficient and selectivity of SHP2 protein.

Considering that both families exhibit potential as drugs to treat various diseases, their activity as anticancer agents has been evaluated in HeLa (cervix), Jurkat (leukaemia) and A549 (lung) cancer cell lines as well as on healthy mice in vivo. In general, whereas 1,4-dihydropyridines show a moderate cytotoxic activity, their urea analogues cause an extraordinary increase in their antiproliferative activity, specially towards HeLa cells. Because of the chiral nature of these compounds, enantiomerically enriched samples were also tested, showing different cytotoxic activity than the racemic mixture. Although the reason is not clear, it could be caused by a complex amalgam of physical and chemical contributions. The studied compounds also exhibit luminescent properties, which allow performing a biodistribution study in cancer cells. They have emission maxima between 420 and 471 nm, being the urea derivatives in general red shifted. Emission quenching was observed for those compounds containing a nitro group (3e,f and 5e,f). Fluorescence microscopy showed that 1,4-dihydropyridines 3a and 3g localised in the lysosomes, in contrast to the urea derivatives 5h that accumulated in the cell membrane. This different distribution could be key to explain the differences found in the cytotoxic activity and in the mechanism of action. Interestingly, a preliminary in vivo study regarding the acute toxicity of some of these compounds on healthy mice has been conducted, using a concentration up to 7200 times higher than the corresponding IC50 value. No downgrade in the welfare of the tested mice was observed, which could support their use in preclinical tumour models.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In the foreseeable future, further approvals are expected, e.g., in mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Clinical trials with new constructs are ongoing in almost all cancer entities. The introduction of this completely new principle implicates unusual challenges: (1) The use of genetically modified ""living drugs"" is challenging from a regulatory point of view and might require a lifelong surveillance of the patient, (2) companies and authorities make high demands on the quality management at the sites, (3) the price of about 280,000euro for the approved treatments rises new socioeconomic and ethical questions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 131 patients who received a PBSC haplograft in order to precise the impact of acute GVHD on outcomes. There were 78 males and 53 females and the median age for the whole cohort was 59 years (range: 20-71). Thirty-five patients were allografted for a lymphoid disease and 96 for a myeloid malignancy, including 67 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence (CI) of day 100 grade 2-4 and 3-4 acute GVHD was 43.4 + 4.6% and 16.7 + 3.4%, respectively. The 2-year CI of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 10.1 + 2.8%. The only factor affecting the occurrence of GVHD was GVHD prophylaxis. Indeed, CI of day 100 grade 2-4 (but not grade 3-4) acute GVHD was significantly reduced when adding anti-thymoglobulin (ATG) to PTCY. However, in multivariate analysis, grade 2 acute GVHD was significantly associated with better disease-free (HR: 0.36; 95%CI: 0.19-0.69, p = .002) and overall (HR: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.1-0.70, p = .003) survivals. The same results were observed when considering only AML patients. CONCLUSION: Acute grade 2 GVHD is a factor of good prognosis after PBSC haplotransplant with PTCY.

However, the cell surface receptor molecules facilitating the entry of tumor cell-adapted rotavirus are not completely characterized. Using infection blocking assays with antibodies to some heat shock proteins (HSPs) and also some inhibitors of these cellular proteins, we were able to identify the cell surface Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp60, Hsp40, PDI and integrin beta3 as receptors of tumor cell-adapted rotavirus in Reh cells. Furthermore, the results also indicated that these rotavirus receptors are associated with lipid microdomains (rafts). Our findings provide evidence that rotavirus tropism for these human acute lymphocytic leukemia cells is explained by the relatively high expression of some HSPs in rafts.

We followed up patients for one year to determine disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and its relation to the CCND1 genotype. RESULTS: We found that AA genotype and A allele have a higher risk of developing ALL compared to the control group. Additionally, we found no notable association between CCND1 variant and methotrexate cytotoxicity and no role of CCND1 polymorphism in ALL prognosis.

However, the prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD mutation in adult, non-transplant patients is still unclear therefore we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explain this issue. The main outcome was overall survival (OS), while additional outcomes included event-free survival (EFS). METHODS: Seven Databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, SpringerLink, ProQuest, and EBSCOhost) were searched up to August 2020. Studies investigating the prognostic value of AML in adults with FLT3-ITD mutational status were selected. Studies which patients had received transplantation, diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or secondary AML were excluded. The selected studies were divided into subgroups based on their cytogenetic profile. Summary hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using fixed-effects models. Heterogeneity tests were conducted and presented in I2 value. Forest plot was presented to facilitate understanding of the results. Publication bias was analyzed by Funnel Plot test. RESULTS: A total of ten studies describing research conducted from 1999 to 2020, met the inclusion criteria for this study. Nine studies reported OS and four studies reported EFS in HR. The highest HR for OS is 6.33 (95% CI, 2.61-15.33; p < 0.001), for EFS is 3.58 (95% CI, 1.59 - 8.05); p = 0.002)., while the lowest for OS is 1.33 (95% CI, 0.88-2.01; P = 0.174) and for EFS is 1.29 (95% CI, 0.75-2.23; p = 0.34). Nine studies were included in meta-analysis with HR for OS 1.91 (95% CI, 1.59-2.30, p < 0.00001), whereas 4 studies were included in meta-analysis for EFS with HR 1.64 (95% CI, 1.25-2.14; p = 0.0003).

MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) levels have recently emerged as novel biomarkers for different diseases. However, the conventional RNU6B (U6), used as the reference for intracellular miRNA, may not be appropriate for the normalization of circulating miRNAs. METHODS: We measured the levels of U6, spiked-in RNA, and miR-21 in the BMF of 13 healthy controls and 37 patients with hematological disorders to investigate the reliability of either U6 or spike-in RNA as an endogenous reference and also to study the correlation between miR-21, hematological disorders and mortality. RESULTS: Notably, the levels of U6 demonstrated a high variability in BMF of healthy controls and patients. In contrast, the levels of spiked-in RNA displayed a significantly higher stability in both cohorts. Compared with controls, the levels of miR-21 were significantly upregulated in BMF of patients with leukemia but not lymphoma. Also, using 21 as the cut-off value of miR-21, it differentiated the mortality of patients with hematologic disorders.

We aimed to investigate the impact of MRD in pre- and post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) periods on prognostic parameters. Materials and Methods: Seventy-seven AML patients who underwent AHSCT in complete morphological remission were included. MRD analyses were performed by 10-color MFC and 10(-4) was defined as positive. Relapse risk and survival outcomes were assessed based on pre- and post-AHSCT MRD positivity. Results: The median age of the patients was 46 (range: 18-71) years, and 41 (53.2%) were male while 36 (46.8%) were female. The median follow-up after AHSCT was 12.2 months (range: 0.2-73.0). The 2-year overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort was 37.0%, with a significant difference between patients who were MRD-negative and MRD-positive before AHSCT, estimated as 63.0% versus 16.0%, respectively (p=0.005). MRD positivity at +28 days after AHSCT was also associated with significantly inferior 2-year OS when compared to MRD negativity (p=0.03). The risk of relapse at 1 year was 2.4 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.1-5.6; p=0.04) in the pre-AHSCT MRD-positive group when compared to the MRD-negative group regardless of other transplant-related factors, including pre-AHSCT disease status (i.e., complete remission 1 and 2). Event-free survival (EFS) was significantly shorter in patients who were pre-AHSCT MRD-positive (p=0.016). Post-AHSCT MRD positivity was also related to an increased relapse risk. OS and EFS were significantly inferior among MRD-positive patients at +28 days after AHSCT (p=0.03 and p=0.019).

However, there were only a few detailed reports on the profile of immune reconstitution after anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. METHODS: Thirty nine patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy were enrolled. Subjects died, relapsed, received other treatment, or lost to follow-up within 60 days post-infusion were excluded. 21 patients were finally selected. Laboratory and clinical data were collected for analysis of immune reconstitution. RESULTS: CD8+ cells were the first to recover with a median time on day 21(7-87), followed by CD16/CD56+ cells on day 28(14-87), and finally CD4+ cells with only 5(23.81%) patients recovered within 60 days post-infusion. CD4/CD8 ratio was inverted, sustaining for at least 1 year. B cell aplasia occurred in all patients and CD19+ cells returned to normal on a median time of day 79(41-118). All patients developed hypogammaglobulinemia with a median onset time of 2 weeks post-infusion. IgG recovered in 6 patients with a median time on day 184(89-346). IgM recovered on days 212, 242, and 346 in 3 patients. IgA recovered most slowly and remained low >1 year postinfusion. A total of 9 infections occurred in 6(28.57%) patients.

Randomized trials are largely lacking, and the main issues of optimal therapy and prognostic factors remain unclear. Area covered: This systematic review includes all literature evaluating treatment outcome after first relapse. We searched databases PubMed and Embase.com. Twelve out of six thousand articles were ultimately included, based on age of the population (<21 years), relapsed AML, and information on clinical outcome (second complete remission (CR2), disease-free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)). There was only one randomized clinical trial reported. This review shows that there is no standard treatment for relapsed AML in children, and that outcome varies for CR2 and (2- to 10-year) OS rates, mean 64% (range, 50-75%), and 31% (16-43%), respectively. Children treated with chemotherapy only in first complete remission (CR1) tend to have better outcome after relapse than children receiving allo-SCT in CR1. Allo-SCT seems to be the most effective consolidation therapy in children achieving CR2, after relapse. Duration of CR1 was the most frequently reported statistically significant prognostic factor. Through randomized clinical trials, better knowledge of prognostic factors enabling risk-stratified treatment, and of more effective and less toxic therapies, should contribute to better clinical outcome for children with relapsed AML. Expert opinion: Outcome of pediatric relapsed AML has improved to OS rates up to 40%. However, there is a lack of knowledge on (independent) prognostic factors, optimal reinduction chemotherapy, timing of allo-SCT, and late effects. International collaboration should enable large, randomized clinical trials addressing these issues.",,"['Hoffman, Anne E', 'Schoonmade, Linda J', 'Kaspers, Gertjan Jl']","['Hoffman AE', 'Schoonmade LJ', 'Kaspers GJ']","[""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Pediatric Oncology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , Amsterdam."", 'Medical Library, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Pediatric Oncology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , Amsterdam."", 'Princess Maxima Center For Pediatric Oncolocy , The Netherlands, Utrecht.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Rate']",,,2020/10/29 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/10/28 08:43'],"['2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/28 08:43 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2021.1841640 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2021 Jan;21(1):45-52. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2021.1841640.

The American College of Radiology recommends ultrasound (US) for initial imaging of AP in all populations to assess for ductal obstruction. However, US may be insensitive to diagnose and assess chemotherapy-associated AP. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Patients with ALL and AP were identified from protocol databases, using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3. Chemotherapy dosing, amylase/lipase levels, clinical symptoms, and US/computed tomography (CT) reports within 10 days of diagnosis were recorded. All CT images were reviewed for revised Atlanta classification and CT severity index (CTSI). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients, aged 2-21 years, experienced 88 episodes of AP, undergoing 98 US and 44 CT. Seventy-two events (82%) occurred within 30 days of asparaginase administration. Sixty-nine episodes (78%) were initially diagnosed by the presence of abdominal pain and pancreatic enzyme elevation.

Their use in DNA medicine is limited by an inability to transfect, for example, nondividing or suspension cells. In recent years, star-shaped synthetic polycationic vectors, so called ""Nanostars"", have shown some promise in this regard, at least when compared to the ""gold standard"" in nonviral vectors, namely, linear poly(ethyleneimine) (l-PEI). It has been hypothesized that an ability to transiently destabilize cellular membranes is partially responsible for the phenomenon. This hypothesis is investigated here, taking human leukemia suspension cells (Jurkat cells) as an example. Contrary to l-PEI, the Nanostars promote the cellular uptake of small, normally membrane-impermeant molecules (trypan blue and propidium iodide) as well as that of fluorescent polystyrene beads (average diameter 100 nm). Since Nanostars, but not l-PEI, are apparently able to deliver DNA to nuclei of nondividing cells, nuclear uptake is, in addition, investigated with isolated cell nuclei. Our results provide evidence that Nanostars are more efficient than l-PEI in increasing the nuclear membrane association/permeability, allowing accumulation of their cargo on/in the nucleus.",,"['Jerome, Valerie', 'Synatschke, Christopher V', 'Freitag, Ruth']","['Jerome V', 'Synatschke CV', 'Freitag R']","['Process Biotechnology, University of Bayreuth, 95440 Bayreuth, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Ackermannweg 10, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Process Biotechnology, University of Bayreuth, 95440 Bayreuth, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,ACS Omega,ACS omega,101691658,,,,PMC7581230,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],2020/10/29 06:00,2020/10/29 06:01,['2020/10/28 05:42'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsomega.0c03367 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Omega. 2020 Oct 5;5(41):26640-26654. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.0c03367. eCollection 2020 Oct 20.,26640-26654,,20201005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 was first identified as a tumor suppressor gene in Wilms' tumor. However, overexpression of WT1 has been detected in several types of malignancy including some types of leukemia. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying WT1-mediated leukemogenesis, lentiviral-based siRNA was employed as a tool to suppress WT1 expression in the myeloid leukemia cell line, K562. Successfully, both WT1 RNA and protein levels were downregulated in the leukemia cells. The silencing of WT1 resulted in significant growth inhibition in WT1-siRNA-treated cells for 40 +/- 7.0%, 44 +/- 9.5%, and 88 +/- 9.1% at 48, 72, and 96 hours posttransduction as compared with the control cells, respectively. By using apoptosis detection assays (caspase-3/7 activity and Annexin V-FITC/PI assays), WT1 silencing induced a higher degree of early and late apoptosis in siRNA-treated K562 as compared with the control cells. Interestingly, the expression of survival signaling genes, IL-2, IL-2RB, and IL-2RG, was also suppressed after WT1-siRNA treatment. In addition, the WT1 silencing also inhibited the S phase of the cell cycle and induced cell death. Our results indicated that WT1 silencing by siRNA can suppress cellular proliferation, induce apoptosis, and reduce S phase fraction of K562 cells. Moreover, transcriptional modulation of IL-2, IL-2RB, and IL2-2RG expression by WT1 was likely involved in this phenotypic change. Overall, this study confirmed the oncogenic role of WT1 in myeloid leukemia and discovered the new target genes of WT1 which are likely involved in WT1-mediated leukemogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Duangnapa Dejjuy et al.'],"['Dejjuy, Duangnapa', 'Dechsukhum, Chavaboon', 'Pattanapanyasat, Kovit', 'Noulsri, Egarit', 'Dissen, Gregory A', 'Leeanansaksiri, Wilairat']","['Dejjuy D', 'Dechsukhum C', 'Pattanapanyasat K', 'Noulsri E', 'Dissen GA', 'Leeanansaksiri W']","['School of Preclinic, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, 111 University Avenue, Muang, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.', 'School of Pathology, Institute of Medicine, Suranaree University of Technology, 111 University Avenue, Muang, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.', 'Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 2 Wanglang Road, Bangkok Noi, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 2 Wanglang Road, Bangkok Noi, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Molecular Virology Core, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University, 505 NW 185th Ave., Beaverton, OR 97006, USA.', 'School of Preclinic, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, 111 University Avenue, Muang, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor beta Subunit/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'RNA Interference/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'S Phase/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",PMC7582064,['There is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.'],2020/10/29 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:42'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/7851414 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Oct 14;2020:7851414. doi: 10.1155/2020/7851414. eCollection 2020.,7851414,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4886-8541', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6194-9410', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8447-3048', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8557-8631', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4873-0996', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8057-1828']",20201014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Cancer cases recorded during 2017 at the Basra Cancer Control Centre, the Department of Pathology and Forensic Medicine, the Basra Oncology and Hematology Centre, the Basra Children's Hospital and at private laboratories were included in the study. Patients' records were analysed for information related to age, gender, residence and type of cancer. Incidences for different geographical regions and distribution of incidences across age groups were recorded as percentages. The mean age was recorded for patients of different genders and age groups. Incidence rates per 100,000 were calculated for different types of cancer. Results: A total of 2,163 cancer cases were identified of which 2,020 were in adults (93.4%) and 143 were in children (6.6%). Among adults, most cancers were found in females (59%). Patients' mean age at diagnosis was 51.4 +/- 19.6 years for adults and 6.4 +/- 4.23 years for children. Cancer incidence rates per 100,000 people increased with age. Breast cancer was the most frequent cancer type found in adult females, with an incidence rate of 60.64 per 100,000 people. The most common types of cancer found in adult males were urinary bladder and lung and bronchus cancers; leukaemia was the most common cancer in children. Conclusion: The findings from this study can be used for predicting cancer epidemiology in Basra, Iraq, and to identify subsets of the population at high risk of cancer incidence. This information will help healthcare providers to adequately respond to the demands of diagnosis, treatment and palliative care for such patients.","['(c) Copyright 2020, Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal, All Rights', 'Reserved.']","['Abood, Rafid A', 'Abdahmed, Kareem A', 'Mazyed, Seena S']","['Abood RA', 'Abdahmed KA', 'Mazyed SS']","['Department of Medicine, Basra College of Medicine, Basra, Iraq.', 'Basra Oncology and Hematology Centre, Basra, Iraq.', 'Cancer Control Centre, Basra Health Directorate, Basra, Iraq.', 'Cancer Control Centre, Basra Health Directorate, Basra, Iraq.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Epidemiology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data']",PMC7574812,['CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2020/10/29 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:41'],"['2019/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.18295/squmj.2020.20.03.008 [doi]', 'squmj2008-e295-300 [pii]']",ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2020 Aug;20(3):e295-e300. doi: 10.18295/squmj.2020.20.03.008.

Most patients are refractory to chemotherapies and despite high response rates after alemtuzumab, virtually all patients relapse. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for novel therapies in T-PLL. As the chemokine receptor CCR7 is a molecule expressed in a wide range of malignancies and relevant in many tumor processes, the present study addressed the biologic role of this receptor in T-PLL. Furthermore, we elucidated the mechanisms of action mediated by an anti-CCR7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and evaluated whether its anti-tumor activity would warrant development towards clinical applications in T-PLL. Our results demonstrate that CCR7 is a prognostic biomarker for overall survival in T-PLL patients and a functional receptor involved in the migration, invasion, and survival of leukemic cells. Targeting CCR7 with a mAb inhibited ligand-mediated signaling pathways and induced tumor cell killing in primary samples. In addition, directing antibodies against CCR7 was highly effective in T-cell leukemia xenograft models. Together, these findings make CCR7 an attractive molecule for novel mAb-based therapeutic applications in T-PLL, a disease where recent drug screen efforts and studies addressing new compounds have focused on chemotherapy or small molecules.

To better characterize neoplasms with this abnormality, we assessed 20 patients utilizing clinicopathological data, cytogenetic, and targeted next-generation sequencing analysis. We also performed literature review of 58 prior reported cases. Patients included ten men and ten women with median age 55.8 years (range, 27.8-78.8). Diagnoses included 11 acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 5 de novo and 6 secondary), 5 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, 3 de novo excess blasts-2 and 2 therapy-related), 2 chronic myeloid leukemia BCR-ABL1-positive blast phase (1 de novo and 1 secondary), 1 primary myelofibrosis (secondary), and 1 mixed-phenotype acute leukemia T/myeloid (MPAL, secondary). Morphologic dysplasia was identified in all AML cases (5/5), MDS cases (4/4), therapy-related cases (3/3), half of myeloproliferative neoplasm cases (1/2), and one MPAL case assessed. The t(3;12) was detected de novo and in subsequent workups in 9 and 11 patients, respectively. Seven patients had t(3;12) only and eight patients had additional chromosome 7 abnormalities. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization detected MECOM (n = 11) and ETV6 (n = 7) rearrangements in all cases assessed. FLT3 internal tandem duplication was identified in five (25%) patients. We identified 13 genetic abnormalities in the de novo group (n = 9), and 25 in the secondary disease group (n = 11). All patients received chemotherapy, with seven allogeneic and two autologous stem cell transplantations. At last follow-up, 14 (70%) patients died with median survival of 6.3 months (range, 0.1-17.3) after detection of t(3;12). In summary, t(3;12)(q26.2;p13) is a rare cytogenetic abnormality in myeloid neoplasms. Myelodysplasia, chromosome 7 abnormalities, and high blast counts are common, and the prognosis is poor. Given the close relationship between the presence of this cytogenetic abnormality and the MDS-related changes, we recommend adding t(3;12)(q26.2;p13) to the list of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes defining abnormalities of the World Health Organization 2017 classification of myeloid neoplasms.",,"['Ronaghy, Arash', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Wang, Wei', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Muzzafar, Tariq']","['Ronaghy A', 'Hu S', 'Tang Z', 'Wang W', 'Tang G', 'Loghavi S', 'Li S', 'Thakral B', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Muzzafar T']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. tmuzzafar@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2020/10/29 06:00,2020/10/29 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:38'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/28 05:38 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-020-00663-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-020-00663-z [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2021 Feb;34(2):300-313. doi: 10.1038/s41379-020-00663-z.

Development and application of an estimation tool.,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041901 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: Insufficient access to anticancer medicines may contribute to the wide survival differences of children with cancers across the globe. We developed a tool to estimate the volume of medicines and budget requirements to provide chemotherapy to children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). DESIGN: Development and application of an estimation tool. SETTING: Paediatric oncology hospital departments in Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: 318 children aged 0-14 years diagnosed with ALL and 215 children with undiagnosed ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Estimates of volume and budget requirements for administering a full course of chemotherapy for ALL and a further course for children who relapse, according to National Treatment Guidelines. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were the volume (mg) and cost (US$) of medicines needed to treat children with ALL. For medicines whose main indication is paediatric ALL (asparaginase and 6-mercaptopurine), we estimated the difference between volume needed and actual sales in 2017 (secondary outcome). RESULTS: Ten anticancer medicines and four chemoprotective agents are needed for the treatment of paediatric ALL according to the Thai treatment guidelines. Of these 14 medicines, 13 are included in the WHO essential medicines list for children. All are available as generics. We estimated that essential chemotherapy and chemoprotective agents to treat all children diagnosed with ALL in Thailand in 2017 would cost US$ 814 952 (US$ 1 365 422 for diagnosed and undiagnosed children), which corresponds to 0.005% (0.008%) of the country's total health expenditure. The volumes of asparaginase and 6-mercaptopurine available on the Thai market in 2017 were more than sufficient (2.3 and 1.5 times the amounts needed, respectively) to treat all children diagnosed with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Procuring sufficient quantities of essential medicines to treat children with ALL requires relatively modest resources. Medicine cost should not be a major barrier to ALL treatment in similar settings.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

In this study, the potential anti-leukemia activities of prepared garlic essential oil (GEO) and some organosulfur compounds contained therein were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Garlic essential oil component identification by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). MTT assay evaluated cytotoxicity of tested samples. Leukemia cell differentiation was determined by NBT assay. Apoptosis and related mechanisms were investigated by western blotting. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis confirmed that the two most abundant constituents, diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATriS), constituted 80% of the composition. GEO and DADS exhibited the best effects in terms of significant production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction apoptosis and potentiation differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells. The GEO-mediated apoptosis was alleviated by the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). CONCLUSION: The anti-leukemia activity of GEO and organosulfur compound DADS through the action of ROS elevation was herein confirmed.","['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Agassi, Sze Fat Tin', 'Yeh, Tsung-Ming', 'Chang, Ching-Dong', 'Hsu, Jue-Liang', 'Shih, Wen-Ling']","['Agassi SFT', 'Yeh TM', 'Chang CD', 'Hsu JL', 'Shih WL']","['Graduate Institute of Bioresources, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'General Research Service Center, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung, Taiwan, R.O.C. wlshih@mail.npust.edu.tw.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfur Compounds)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Garlic/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Oils, Volatile/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfur Compounds/*pharmacology']",,,2020/10/29 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:31'],"['2020/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['40/11/6345 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.14655 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Nov;40(11):6345-6354. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.14655.,6345-6354,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Differentiation', 'HL-60 cells', 'apoptosis', 'diallyl sulfide', 'garlic', 'gas chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'human promyelocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hypothesis of autoantigen stimulation in leukemic clone selection might explain 'stereotypy' of B-cell receptors. In healthy cells, cofilin-1 (CFL1) has multiple functions. Its role was described in several malignancies. The aim of this study was characterization of the role of CFL1 in CLL. Materialas and Methods: Cells from peripheral blood of 180 patients and 42 healthy volunteers (HVs) were isolated. Gene expression was assessed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); western blot was performed for determination of protein level and activity. After silencing of CFL1 gene, cell ability for migration and chemotaxis was investigated with Transwell method. Post-silencing, apoptosis and cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In RT-qPCR, we observed significantly higher expression of CFL1. Higher activity of protein in CLL cells when compared to HVs was detected. Knock-down of CFL1 led to decreased chemotaxis and migration of CLL cells versus cells from HVs. Apoptosis was increased amongst cells with silenced CFL1 and correlated with higher proportion of cells in the G2/M phase. CONCLUSION: Significantly higher expression of CFL1 mRNA in CLL and higher protein activity might indicate high utilization of CFL1 in malignant cells, maintaining their viability, as its inhibition affected viability, cell-cycle progression and motility of leukemia cells.","['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Karp, Marta', 'Karczmarczyk, Agnieszka', 'Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka', 'Purkot, Joanna', 'Chojnacki, MichaL', 'ZajAc, MaLgorzata', 'Korpysz, Maciej', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Hus, Marek', 'Morawska, Marta', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Karp M', 'Karczmarczyk A', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Purkot J', 'Chojnacki M', 'ZajAc M', 'Korpysz M', 'Tomczak W', 'Hus M', 'Morawska M', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemical Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', ""Hematology Department, St John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland."", 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland krzysztof.giannopoulos@gmail.com.', ""Hematology Department, St John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Cofilin 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemotaxis/genetics', 'Cofilin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",,,2020/10/29 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:31'],"['2020/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['40/11/6327 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.14653 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Nov;40(11):6327-6335. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.14653.,6327-6335,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CFL1', 'CLL', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'chemotaxis', 'cofilin-1', 'migration']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is imperative to develop novel strategies for overcoming chemoresistance and improving clinical outcomes. We evaluated the in vitro activity and mechanism of action of dihydroergocristine (DHECS), an ergot alkaloid approved for the treatment of dementia, in PCa cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro effects of DHECS on PCa cell cycle and viability were determined by flow cytometry and colorimetric assay. The effects of DHECS on PCa cell signaling were evaluated by quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and reporter assay. RESULTS: DHECS was effective in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human PCa cells. Of particular interest, DHECS demonstrated high potency against chemoresistant PCa cells. At the molecular level, DHECS affected multiple factors implicated in the regulation of cancer cell cycle and programmed cell death, including p53, mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), retinoblastoma protein (RB), p21, E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), survivin, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, DHECS may function through dopamine receptor-mediated effects on 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). CONCLUSION: DHECS has the potential to be repurposed as a novel anticancer agent for the management of chemoresistant PCa.","['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Bai, Lijuan', 'Li, Xin', 'Ma, Xiaowei', 'Zhao, Rui', 'Wu, Daqing']","['Bai L', 'Li X', 'Ma X', 'Zhao R', 'Wu D']","['Department of Geriatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, P.R.

FLT3-ITD mutation is present in 30% of adult patients with AML and 2-5% in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The impact of these mutations on the prognosis of ALL patients, has not yet been established. Moreover, a limited number of publications regarding the level of expression of the FLT3 receptor (CD135) in both leukemias exist. This study aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes associated to the presence of FLT3-ITD mutation and the expression of CD135. METHODS: 82 adult patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (39 with AML and 43 with ALL) were included. Flow cytometry and RT-PCR were done to analyze the expression of CD135 and the presence of FLT3 ITD mutation, respectively. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD was present in 14 (36%) of AML and 15 (35%) of ALL patients. Disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower in ALL patients having a CD135 expression >3000 cells/muL. There was a trend for poor OS in AML patients expressing FLT3 ITD. OS was worse in AML patients with high expression of CD135. CONCLUSION: A higher (35%) frequency of FLT3-ITD was found in adult ALL patients. The presence of FLT3-ITD was associated with a trend of poor OS in AML cases, and overexpression of CD135 was correlated with poor DFS in ALL cases and poor OS in both acute leukemias.",['Copyright (c) 2021 IMSS.

In recent years, many studies have been conducted on the anti-tumor effect of shikonin and its derivatives, the major active components of A. euchroma. However, the underlying mechanism of action (MoA) for all the components of A. euchroma on leukemia has not been explored systematically. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the MoA of A. euchroma on leukemia via network pharmacology approach. Firstly, the chemical components and their concentrations in A. euchroma as well as leukemia-related targets were collected. Next, we predicted compound-target interactions (CTIs) with our balanced substructure-drug-target network-based inference (bSDTNBI) method. The known and predicted targets of A. euchroma and leukemia-related targets were merged together to construct A. euchroma-leukemia protein-protein interactions (PPIs) network. Then, weighted compound-target bipartite network was constructed according to combination of eight central attributes with concentration information through Cytoscape. Additionally, molecular docking simulation was performed to calculate whether the components and predicted targets have interactions or not. RESULTS: A total of 65 components of A. euchroma were obtained and 27 of them with concentration information, which were involved in 157 targets and 779 compound-target interactions (CTIs). Following the calculation of eight central attributes of targets in A. euchroma-leukemia PPI network, 37 targets with all central attributes greater than the median values were selected to construct the weighted compound-target bipartite network and do the KEGG pathway analysis. We found that A. euchroma candidate targets were significantly associated with several apoptosis and inflammation-related biological pathways, such as MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, IL-17 signaling, and T cell receptor signaling pathways. Moreover, molecular docking simulation demonstrated that there were eight pairs of predicted CTIs had the strong binding free energy. CONCLUSIONS: This study deciphered that the efficacy of A. euchroma in the treatment of leukemia might be attributed to 10 targets and 14 components, which were associated with inhibiting leukemia cell survival and inducing apoptosis, relieving inflammatory environment and inhibiting angiogenesis.",,"['Wang, Biting', 'Wu, Zengrui', 'Wang, Jiye', 'Li, Weihua', 'Liu, Guixia', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Tang, Yun']","['Wang B', 'Wu Z', 'Wang J', 'Li W', 'Liu G', 'Zhang B', 'Tang Y']","['Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China. zengruiwu@ecust.edu.cn.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Phytomedicine Resource and Utilization, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Shihezi University, Shihezi, 832002, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China. ytang234@ecust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['U1603122/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81673356/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],England,BMC Complement Med Ther,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,101761232,,IM,"['Boraginaceae/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', '*Protein Interaction Maps']",PMC7590697,,2020/10/29 06:00,2021/07/02 06:00,['2020/10/28 05:28'],"['2020/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 05:28 [entrez]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12906-020-03106-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-020-03106-z [pii]']",epublish,BMC Complement Med Ther. 2020 Oct 27;20(1):322. doi: 10.1186/s12906-020-03106-z.,322,,20201027,['NOTNLM'],"['Arnebia euchroma', 'Concentration', 'Leukemia', 'Network pharmacology', 'Traditional Chinese medicine', 'Weighted network']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tendency of transcriptomic studies to combine AML samples, regardless of cytogenetic abnormalities, could lead to bias in differential gene expression analysis because of the differential representation of AML subgroups. Hence, we performed a horizontal meta-analysis that integrated transcriptomic data on AML from multiple studies, to enrich the less frequent cytogenetic subgroups and to uncover common genes involved in the development of AML and response to therapy. A total of 28 Affymetrix microarray data sets containing 3940 AML samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. After stringent quality control, transcriptomic data on 1534 samples from 11 data sets, covering 10 AML cytogenetically defined subgroups, were retained and merged with the data on 198 healthy bone marrow samples. Differentially expressed genes between each cytogenetic subgroup and normal samples were extracted, enabling the unbiased identification of 330 commonly deregulated genes (CODEGs), which showed enriched profiles of myeloid differentiation, leukemic stem cell status, and relapse.

We identified CSF3R as a new germ line hematologic malignancy predisposition gene through analysis of 832 next-generation sequencing tests conducted in 632 patients with hematologic malignancies. Among germ line CSF3R variants, 3 were abnormal in functional testing, indicating their deleterious nature. p.Trp547* was identified in 2 unrelated men with myelodysplastic syndromes diagnosed at 76 and 33 years of age, respectively. p.Trp547* is a loss-of-function nonsense variant in the extracellular domain that results in decreased CSF3R messenger RNA expression and abrogation of CSF3R surface expression and proliferative responses to G-CSF. p.Ala119Thr is a missense variant found in 2 patients with multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. This variant is located between the extracellular immunoglobulin-like and cytokine receptor homology domains and results in decreased G-CSF sensitivity. p.Pro784Thr was identified in a 67-year-old man with multiple myeloma. p.Pro784Thr is a missense variant in the cytoplasmic domain that inhibits CSF3R internalization, producing a gain-of-function phenotype and G-CSF hypersensitivity.

Here, we dissect the bone marrow niche in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis. We combined immunohistochemical stainings with global gene expression analyses from these AML patients and correlated them with clinical features. Mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) lost quiescence and significantly expanded in the bone marrow of AML patients. Strikingly, their HSC- and niche-regulating capacities were impaired with significant inhibition of osteogenesis and bone formation in a cell contact-dependent manner through inhibition of cytoplasmic beta-catenin. Assessment of bone metabolism by quantifying peripheral blood osteocalcin levels revealed 30% lower expression in AML patients at first diagnosis than in non-leukemic donors. Furthermore, patients with osteocalcin levels </=11 ng/mL showed inferior overall survival with a 1-year survival rate of 38.7% whereas patients with higher osteocalcin levels reached a survival rate of 66.8%.

We then examined the effects of reduced SEV secretion on progression of MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as normal hematopoiesis. Blocking SEV secretion from ECs, but not perivascular cells, megakaryocytes, or spleen stromal cells, markedly delayed the leukemia progression. Notably, reducing SEV production from ECs had no effect on normal hematopoiesis. Protein analysis showed that EC-derived SEVs contained a high level of ANGPTL2, which accelerated leukemia progression via binding to the LILRB2 receptor. Moreover, ANGPTL2-SEVs released from ECs were governed by VPS33B. Importantly, ANGPTL2-SEVs were also required for primary human AML cell maintenance.

Acute genetic deletion of Zeb1 led to rapid-onset thymic atrophy and apoptosis-driven loss of thymocytes and T cells. A profound cell-autonomous self-renewal defect and multilineage differentiation block were observed in Zeb1-KO HSCs. Loss of Zeb1 in HSCs activated transcriptional programs of deregulated HSC maintenance and multilineage differentiation genes and of cell polarity consisting of cytoskeleton-, lipid metabolism/lipid membrane-, and cell adhesion-related genes. Notably, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression was prodigiously upregulated in Zeb1-KO HSCs, which correlated with enhanced cell survival, diminished mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, and differentiation capacity and an activated transcriptomic signature associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) signaling. ZEB1 expression was downregulated in AML patients, and Zeb1 KO in the malignant counterparts of HSCs - leukemic stem cells (LSCs) - accelerated MLL-AF9- and Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML progression, implicating Zeb1 as a tumor suppressor in AML LSCs. Thus, Zeb1 acts as a transcriptional regulator in hematopoiesis, critically coordinating HSC self-renewal, apoptotic, and multilineage differentiation fates required to suppress leukemic potential in AML.",,"['Almotiri, Alhomidi', 'Alzahrani, Hamed', 'Menendez-Gonzalez, Juan Bautista', 'Abdelfattah, Ali', 'Alotaibi, Badi', 'Saleh, Lubaid', 'Greene, Adelle', 'Georgiou, Mia', 'Gibbs, Alex', 'Alsayari, Amani', 'Taha, Sarab', 'Thomas, Leigh-Anne', 'Shah, Dhruv', 'Edkins, Sarah', 'Giles, Peter', 'Stemmler, Marc P', 'Brabletz, Simone', 'Brabletz, Thomas', 'Boyd, Ashleigh S', 'Siebzehnrubl, Florian A', 'Rodrigues, Neil P']","['Almotiri A', 'Alzahrani H', 'Menendez-Gonzalez JB', 'Abdelfattah A', 'Alotaibi B', 'Saleh L', 'Greene A', 'Georgiou M', 'Gibbs A', 'Alsayari A', 'Taha S', 'Thomas LA', 'Shah D', 'Edkins S', 'Giles P', 'Stemmler MP', 'Brabletz S', 'Brabletz T', 'Boyd AS', 'Siebzehnrubl FA', 'Rodrigues NP']","['European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'College of Applied Medical Sciences-Dawadmi, Shaqra University, Dawadmi, Saudi Arabia.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Wales Gene Park and Wales Cancer Research Centre, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Wales Gene Park and Wales Cancer Research Centre, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine 1, Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Center for Molecular Medicine, FAU University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine 1, Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Center for Molecular Medicine, FAU University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine 1, Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Center for Molecular Medicine, FAU University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Hospital, and.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (ZEB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7773410,,2020/10/28 06:00,2021/09/09 06:00,['2020/10/27 17:36'],"['2019/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/27 17:36 [entrez]']","['129115 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI129115 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1). pii: 129115. doi: 10.1172/JCI129115.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow differentiation', '*Hematology', '*Stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) combined with minimal-dose decitabine (Dec) on the prevention of HR-AML relapse after allo-HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Two hundred four patients with HR-AML who had received allo-HSCT 60-100 days before randomization and who were minimal residual disease negative were randomly assigned 1:1 to either rhG-CSF combined with minimal-dose Dec (G-Dec group: 100 microg/m(2) of rhG-CSF on days 0-5 and 5 mg/m(2) of Dec on days 1-5) or no intervention (non-G-Dec group). The primary outcome was relapse after transplantation, and the secondary outcomes were chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), safety of the treatment, and survival. RESULTS: The estimated 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the G-Dec group was 15.0% (95% CI, 8.0% to 22.1%), compared with 38.3% (95% CI, 28.8% to 47.9%) in the non-G-Dec group (P < .01), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.57; P < .01). There was no statistically significant difference between the G-Dec and non-G-Dec groups in the 2-year cumulative incidence of cGVHD without relapse (23.0% [95% CI, 14.7% to 31.3%] and 21.7% [95% CI, 13.6% to 29.7%], respectively; P = .82), with an HR of 1.07 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.92; P = .81). After rhG-CSF combined with minimal-dose Dec maintenance, increasing numbers of natural killer, CD8+ T, and regulatory T cells were observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rhG-CSF combined with minimal-dose Dec maintenance after allo-HSCT can reduce the incidence of relapse, accompanied by changes in the number of lymphocyte subtypes.",,"['Gao, Lei', 'Zhang, Yanqi', 'Wang, Sanbin', 'Kong, Peiyan', 'Su, Yi', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Bai, Hai', 'Lang, Tao', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Liu, Li', 'Yang, Tonghua', 'Huang, Xiaobing',

METHODS: Plasma concentrations of nilotinib and PCSK9 were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: LDL cholesterol concentrations at 1 month after nilotinib treatment were significantly increased compared with those before therapy. The mean C0 (+/-SD) of nilotinib at 1, 2, and 3 months after nilotinib treatment were 645 +/- 516, 902 +/- 623, and 951 +/- 1088 ng/mL, respectively. Mean PCSK9 concentrations at 3 months after nilotinib treatment were significantly higher than those at the start of therapy (320 vs 257 ng/mL, respectively, P = .019). When the change rate in the PCSK9 concentration induced by nilotinib was classified with a cut-off value of +40%, the change rate in LDL cholesterol in patients with a change rate in PCSK9 of >/=40% was significantly higher than that in patients with a PCSK9 change rate of <40% (67.1% vs 38.0%, P = .043); however, there were no differences in mean nilotinib C0 . WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Nilotinib may lead to hypercholesterolaemia by increasing plasma concentrations of PCSK9 after indirect inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. In addition, certain patients seem to have high sensitivity for nilotinib in a signalling cascade of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, despite low plasma concentrations of nilotinib. Consequently, nilotinib-induced hypercholesterolaemia could not be predicted based on the plasma concentration of nilotinib.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Abumiya, Maiko', 'Akamine, Yumiko', 'Sato, Shiori', 'Takahashi, Saori', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Miura, Masatomo']","['Abumiya M', 'Akamine Y', 'Sato S', 'Takahashi S', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Miura M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],['20K07150/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Proprotein Convertase 9)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cholesterol, LDL/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercholesterolemia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proprotein Convertase 9/*blood', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/10/28 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2020/10/27 12:14'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/27 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.13294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2021 Apr;46(2):382-387. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.13294.

Crenigacestat (LY3039478) prevents cleavage of Notch proteins and may benefit patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/T-LBL. METHODS: JJCB was a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1 study in adult patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/T-LBL. Eligible patients received Crenigacestat orally 3 times per week plus dexamethasone at 24 mg twice daily on days 1 to 5 every other week in a 28-day cycle. The starting level of Crenigacestat was 50 mg, and dose escalation was performed with a modified 3+3 scheme for the estimation of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the recommended dose level. RESULTS: In total, 36 patients with T-ALL (n = 31 [86.1%]) or T-LBL (n = 5 [13.9%]) were treated with Crenigacestat and dexamethasone. Six patients (16.7%) experienced DLTs: 2 of 12 (16.7%) in the 75-mg cohort (grade 4 gastrointestinal hemorrhage and grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), 1 of 15 (6.7%) in the 100-mg cohort (grade 3 diarrhea), and 3 of 3 (100%) in the 125-mg cohort (grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting). The maximum tolerated dosewas 75 mg plus 24 mg of dexamethasone daily on days 1 to 5. Twenty-eight patients (77.8%) experienced 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse events related to the study treatment. The best overall response was a confirmed response, with 1 patient (2.8%) having a duration of response of 10.51 months. Six patients (16.7%) achieved stable disease, and 12 patients (33.3%) experienced progressive disease. The remaining 17 patients (47.2%) were not evaluable. The median event-free survival was 1.18 months (95% confidence interval, 0.76-2.14 months) among all groups. A pharmacodynamic analysis showed decreased plasma amyloid beta levels.

EVs can selectively encapsulate tissue-specific small molecules from parent cells and efficiently deliver them to recipient cells. As signal mediators of intercellular communication, the molecules packaged in EVs play critical roles in the pathophysiology of diseases. In relevant clinical translation, EV contents have been used for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. To further promote EV-based cancer liquid biopsy toward large-scale clinical implementation, the efficient and specific isolation of pure tumor-derived EVs from body fluids is a prerequisite. However, the existing EV isolation methods are unable to address certain technical challenges, such as lengthy procedures, low throughput, low specificity, heavy protein contamination, etc., and thus, new approaches for EV isolation are required. Here, we report a multivalent, long single-stranded aptamer with repeated units for EV enrichment and retrieval. After short incubation of biotin-labeled multivalent aptamers (MAs) with the samples, EVs can be quickly secured by MAs, anchored onto streptavidin-coated microspheres, and further retrieved via digestion of the DNA aptamer. Approximately 45% of EVs can be isolated from the spiked samples in 40 min with a depletion of 84.7% of albumin contamination. In addition, 93.1% of the isolated EVs can be retrieved via DNase-mediated aptamer degradation in 10 min for downstream molecular analyses. Our findings suggest that MAs can efficiently and specifically isolate EVs derived from malignant lymphocytes, and this simple method could facilitate the EV-centered study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,"['Xue, Fei', 'Chen, Yundi', 'Wen, Yi', 'Abhange, Komal', 'Zhang, Wenlong', 'Cheng, Gong', 'Quinn, Zachary', 'Mao, Wenjun', 'Wan, Yuan']","['Xue F', 'Chen Y', 'Wen Y', 'Abhange K', 'Zhang W', 'Cheng G', 'Quinn Z', 'Mao W', 'Wan Y']","['The Pq Laboratory of Micro/Nano BiomeDx, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Binghamton University-SUNY, Binghamton, NY 13902, USA. ywan@binghamton.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['*Aptamers, Nucleotide', '*Extracellular Vesicles', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Liquid Biopsy', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis']",,,2020/10/28 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/27 08:41'],"['2020/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/27 08:41 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0an01420f [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2021 Jan 4;146(1):253-261. doi: 10.1039/d0an01420f.,253-261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SMR for influenza/ pneumonia-attributed death within the first year following cancer diagnosis was 1.88 (1.83-1.94);while SMR for influenza/pneumonia-attributed death following the first year was 1.11 (1.10-1.12). Within the first year following cancer diagnosis, SMR from influenza/pneumonia was higher among individuals with black race (SMR for white race: 1.75 (95% CI: 1.69-1.81) while SMR for black race: 2.90 (95% CI: 2.65-3.16), lung cancer (SMR for lung cancer: 4.39 (95% CI: 4.11-4.69)), head and neck cancer (SMR for oral cavity/ pharynx cancer: 4.02 (95% CI: 3.50-4.59)), lymphomas (SMR for lymphoma: 3.28 (95% CI: 2.92-3.68)), leukemias (SMR for leukemia: 3.32 (95% CI: 2.89-3.80)) and myeloma (SMR for myeloma: 3.91 (95% CI: 3.28-4.63)).Conclusions: Cancer patients are more likely to have influenza/ pneumonia-attributed death compared to the general US population.

In older adults, AML confers an adverse outcome(1,2). AML originates from a dominant mutation, then acquires collaborative transformative mutations leading to myeloid transformation and clinical/biological heterogeneity. Currently, AML treatment is initiated rapidly, precluding the ability to consider the mutational profile of a patient's leukemia for treatment decisions. Untreated patients with AML >/= 60 years were prospectively enrolled on the ongoing Beat AML trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03013998 ), which aims to provide cytogenetic and mutational data within 7 days (d) from sample receipt and before treatment selection, followed by treatment assignment to a sub-study based on the dominant clone. A total of 487 patients with suspected AML were enrolled; 395 were eligible. Median age was 72 years (range 60-92 years; 38% >/=75 years); 374 patients (94.7%) had genetic and cytogenetic analysis completed within 7 d and were centrally assigned to a Beat AML sub-study; 224 (56.7%) were enrolled on a Beat AML sub-study. The remaining 171 patients elected standard of care (SOC) (103), investigational therapy (28) or palliative care (40); 9 died before treatment assignment. Demographic, laboratory and molecular characteristics were not significantly different between patients on the Beat AML sub-studies and those receiving SOC (induction with cytarabine + daunorubicin (7 + 3 or equivalent) or hypomethylation agent).

However, understanding of the processes that drive transformation of certain clones to cancer is limited. Here we study this phenomenon in the context of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs). We find that mutations are selected differentially based on exposures. Mutations in ASXL1 are enriched in current or former smokers, whereas cancer therapy with radiation, platinum and topoisomerase II inhibitors preferentially selects for mutations in DNA damage response genes (TP53, PPM1D, CHEK2). Sequential sampling provides definitive evidence that DNA damage response clones outcompete other clones when exposed to certain therapies. Among cases in which CH was previously detected, the CH mutation was present at tMN diagnosis. We identify the molecular characteristics of CH that increase risk of tMN. The increasing implementation of clinical sequencing at diagnosis provides an opportunity to identify patients at risk of tMN for prevention strategies.",,"['Bolton, Kelly L', 'Ptashkin, Ryan N',

The diversity of Sezary cell (SC) phenotype and genotype may reflect either plasticity or heterogeneity, which was difficult to evaluate dynamically until the achievement of long-term SC expansion. Therefore, we developed six defined culture conditions allowing for the expansion of SC defined by their phenotype and monoclonality in four of seven SS cases. Engraftment of SC through the intrafemoral route into immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjll)/SzJ (NSG) mice was achieved in 2 of 14 SS cases. Secondary xenograft by percutaneous injection mimicked most of the features of SS with dermal infiltration, epidermotropism, and blood spreading. These models also allowed assessing the intra-individual heterogeneity of patient SC. Subclones sharing the same TCR gene rearrangement evolved independently according to culture conditions and/or after xenografting. This clonal selection was associated with some immunophenotypic plasticity and limited genomic evolution both in vitro and in vivo. The long-term amplification of SC allowed us to develop eight new SC lines derived from four different patients. These lines represent the cell of origin diversity of SC and provide new tools to evaluate their functional hallmarks and response to therapy.",,"['Poglio, Sandrine', 'Prochazkova-Carlotti, Martina', 'Cherrier, Floriane', 'Gros, Audrey', 'Laharanne, Elodie', 'Pham-Ledard, Anne', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Merlio, Jean-Philippe']","['Poglio S', 'Prochazkova-Carlotti M', 'Cherrier F', 'Gros A', 'Laharanne E', 'Pham-Ledard A', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Merlio JP']","['Univ.

Astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) and neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) were immunoprecipitated from plasma of ten untreated first-episode psychotics (FPs) and ten matched normal controls (Cs). Neural mitochondrial electron transport and complement proteins were extracted, quantified by ELISAs and normalized with levels of CD81 exosome marker. Levels of subunits 1 and 6 of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and subunit 10 of cytochrome b-c1 oxidase (complex III), but not of subunit 1 of cytochrome C oxidase (complex IV) or superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were significantly lower in ADEs and NDEs of FPs than Cs. This dysregulated pattern of electron transport proteins is associated with increased generation of reactive oxygen species. ADE glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were significantly higher in FPs than Cs, indicating a higher percentage of inflammatory astrocytes in FPs. ADE levels of C3b opsonin were significantly higher and those of C5b-9 attack complex was marginally higher in FPs than Cs. A significantly lower ADE level of the C3 convertase inhibitor CD55 may explain the higher levels of C3 convertase-generated C3b. ADE levels of the neuroprotective protein leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were significantly lower in FPs than Cs, whereas levels of IL-6 were no different.

Little is known about its incidence and outcomes, and treatment options have not been standardized. CASE REPORT A 3-day old, apparently healthy male newborn was referred to the pediatric intensive care unit with multiple violaceous macules and a few papules on his face and upper trunk. After initial spontaneous regression, the lesions reappeared. Skin biopsy and bone marrow aspirate revealed a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL induction therapy was initiated on day 24, resulting in morphological remission at the end of induction therapy. ALL chemotherapy was guided by sequential PCR-based monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). The patient received a transplant from an unrelated HLA high-resolution matched (10/10 loci) permissive donor. He was followed-up after transplant conducted by sequential PCR-based measurements of MRD in bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS Neonatal leukemia often presents as congenital skin lesions known as blueberry muffin rash. ALL induction therapy was started at the end of the neonatal period. Treatment was well-tolerated and effective.

In blood-derived tumors (leukemias and lymphomas), NR4A expression is low and NR4A1(-/-)/NR4A3(-/-) double knockout mice rapidly develop acute myelocytic leukemia, suggesting that these receptors exhibit tumor suppressor activity. Treatment of leukemia and most lymphoma cells with drugs that induce expression of NR4A1and NR4A3 enhances apoptosis, and this represents a potential clinical application for treating this disease. In contrast, most solid tumor-derived cell lines express high levels of NR4A1 and NR4A2, and both receptors exhibit pro-oncogenic activities in solid tumors, whereas NR4A3 exhibits tumor-specific activities. Initial studies with retinoids and apoptosis-inducing agents demonstrated that their cytotoxic activity is NR4A1 dependent and involved drug-induced nuclear export of NR4A1 and formation of a mitochondrial proapoptotic NR4A1-bcl-2 complex. Drug-induced nuclear export of NR4A1 has been reported for many agents/biologics and involves interactions with multiple mitochondrial and extramitochondrial factors to induce apoptosis. Synthetic ligands for NR4A1, NR4A2, and NR4A3 have been identified, and among these compounds, bis-indole derived (CDIM) NR4A1 ligands primarily act on nuclear NR4A1 to inhibit NR4A1-regulated pro-oncogenic pathways/genes and similar results have been observed for CDIMs that bind NR4A2.

LncRNA can be used as an oncogene and tumor suppressor gene through transcriptional regulation in cancer. For example, the over-expressed lncRNA DLEU2 promotes the occurrence of laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, etc., and inhibits the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 2 (DLEU2), as one of the long non-coding RNAs, was first found in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and drawn into the progress of innumerable cancers. The molecular mechanism of DLEU2 in multiple tumors will be revealed. METHODS: In this review, current studies on the biological functions and mechanisms of DLEU2 in tumors are summarized and analyzed; related researches are systematically retrieved and collected through PubMed. RESULTS: DLEU2, a novel cancer-related lncRNA, has been demonstrated to be abnormally expressed in various malignant tumors, including leukemia, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, pharynx and throat cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, breast cancer, osteosarcoma. Besides, lncRNA DLEU2 has been shown to be involved in the process of proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis of cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Due to the biological functions and mechanisms involved in DLEU2, it may represent an available biomarker or potential therapeutic target in a variety of malignant tumors.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Xu, Wen', 'Wang, Bei', 'Cai, Yuxuan', 'Guo, Chong', 'Liu, Kai', 'Yuan, Chengfu']","['Xu W', 'Wang B', 'Cai Y', 'Guo C', 'Liu K', 'Yuan C']","['College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China.', 'College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China.', 'College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China.', 'College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China.', 'College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China.', 'College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China.']",['eng'],"['81773959, 81974528/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2019KZL09/Immunotherapy Key Laboratory of Hubei Province in China', 'WJ2019H527/Health Commission of Hubei Province Scientific Research Project in', 'China']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics', 'Transferases/genetics/metabolism']",,,2020/10/28 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/10/27 05:35'],"['2020/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/27 05:35 [entrez]']","['CPD-EPUB-110910 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612826666201026150857 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2021;27(20):2337-2343. doi: 10.2174/1381612826666201026150857.,2337-2343,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DLEU2', '*Long non-coding RNA', '*biomarker', '*epigenetic regulation.', '*potential therapeutic target', '*tumorigenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL is the most common form of cancer in children and patients who are refractory to standard treatments have poor prognosis. The preparation of blinatumomab is unique and extremely complex. It's important to carry out any information to identify all the critical issues related to the preparation of blinatumomab: sharing procedure between prescribers, staff of the Centralized Chemotherapy Preparation Unit [Unita Farmaci Antiblastici (UFA)] and administering nurses aimed at reducing the clinical risk related to the management of the drug blinatumomab and to obtain correct prescriptions on the real dose to be prepared, safe worksheets with computer processing of all variables (volumes to be added and corresponding dose of drug) and complete labels containing all the information necessary for the control of the preparation and its correct infusion. METHODS: A computerized process involves the use of specific software to which precise instructions must be given. This study is divided into two phases, the first one focused on the analysis of Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the extrapolation of any unclear part of SmPC. The second phase involved the manufacturer to answer a questionnaire. RESULTS: This comparison with the company allowed to perfect the blinatumomab preparation process leading to: 1. allow the patient to be discharged and return a few times for infusions and consequently reduce the number of medical prescriptions; 2. set up the drug for each patient every 4 days; 3. reduce costs related to devices, staff employed. CONCLUSION: Computerizing the preparation of anti-blastic drugs is a necessary path for the safety of the patient and all the operators involved, however it may be necessary to make changes in the preparation process to allow the software to work correctly. The comparison between pharmacist, clinician and, where necessary, the manufacturer of the drug, was effective in the preparation of this drug.",,"['Cirino, Mario', 'Provasi, Riccardo', 'Cebulec, Irina', 'Palmieri, Clara', 'Schincariol, Paolo', 'Zanon, Davide']","['Cirino M', 'Provasi R', 'Cebulec I', 'Palmieri C', 'Schincariol P', 'Zanon D']","['Presidio Ospedaliero Ospedale Maggiore, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata Giuliano Isontina, Trieste, Italy.', 'Presidio Ospedaliero Ospedale Maggiore, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata Giuliano Isontina, Trieste, Italy.', 'Presidio Ospedaliero Ospedale Maggiore, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata Giuliano Isontina, Trieste, Italy.', 'Presidio Ospedaliero Ospedale Maggiore, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata Giuliano Isontina, Trieste, Italy.', 'Presidio Ospedaliero Ospedale Maggiore, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata Giuliano Isontina, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Antibodies, Bispecific/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Software']",,,2020/10/28 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/10/27 05:34'],"['2020/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/27 05:34 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220966394 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Oct;27(7):1674-1683. doi: 10.1177/1078155220966394.

These indolent hematologic malignancies are considered diseases of the elderly, a population that may have dysphagia leading to difficulty swallowing tablets and capsules. Ibrutinib is currently not available in a liquid oral dosage form. We report the utilization and clinical outcomes associated with alternative administration of ibrutinib capsules in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and significant dysphagia. CASE REPORT: An 86-year old female requiring chronic lymphocytic leukemia-directed therapy due to a rising absolute lymphocyte count and worsening, transfusion-dependent anemia with a past medical history of dementia and dysphagia, was initiated on ibrutinib. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Due to the patient's significant inability to swallow, ibrutinib capsules were administered via an alternative method by opening them and sprinkling onto soft food or applesauce. With ibrutinib therapy, the patient has had a significant clinical response in her chronic lymphocytic leukemia as evidenced by her decreased absolute lymphocyte count and achieving transfusion independence with improvements in hemoglobin. DISCUSSION: Ibrutinib administration via this alternative method resulted in an initial clinical response in the treatment of our patient's chronic lymphocytic leukemia as evidenced by a decreasing absolute lymphocyte count and improved anemia that achieved transfusion independence.

Thus, the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) with LSC potential can improve prognosis. Here, we analyzed 115 CML patients and found that CD25 was preferentially expressed on the phenotypic stem and progenitor cells (SPCs), and TKI therapy decreased the number of CD25-positive cells in the SPC fraction. To detect MRD harboring BCR-ABL1 fusion DNA, we developed a highly-sensitive method using patient-specific primers and next-generation sequencing. By using this method, we identified that in patients who achieved molecular remission, almost all residual CD25-positive SPCs were BCR-ABL1-negative. Moreover, in some patients BCR-ABL1 was detectable in peripheral B cells but not in SPCs. We conclude that CD25 marks LSCs at diagnosis but does not mark MRD following TKI treatment and that analysis of peripheral B cells can allow sensitive detection of MRD.",,"['Karigane, Daiki',

The biodistribution of labeled T22-GFP-H6-ATTO and T22-GFP-H6-S-Cy5 nanoparticles has been then compared to that of the non-labeled nanoparticle in different CXCR4+ tumor mouse models. We observed that while parental T22-GFP-H6 nanoparticles accumulated mostly and specifically in CXCR4+ tumor cells, labeled T22-GFP-H6-ATTO and T22-GFP-H6-S-Cy5 nanoparticles showed a dramatic change in the biodistribution pattern, accumulating in non-target organs such as liver or kidney while reducing tumor targeting capacity. Therefore, the use of such labeling molecules should be avoided in target and non-target tissue uptake studies during the design and development of targeted nanoscale drug delivery systems, since their effect over the fate of the nanomaterial can lead to considerable miss-interpretations of the actual nanoparticle biodistribution.",,"['Alamo, Patricia', 'Pallares, Victor', 'Cespedes, Maria Virtudes', 'Falgas, Aida', 'Sanchez, Julieta M', 'Serna, Naroa', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Laura', 'Volta-Duran, Eric', 'Morris, Gordon A', 'Sanchez-Chardi, Alejandro', 'Casanova, Isolda', 'Mangues, Ramon', 'Vazquez, Esther', 'Villaverde, Antonio', 'Unzueta, Ugutz']","['Alamo P', 'Pallares V', 'Cespedes MV', 'Falgas A', 'Sanchez JM', 'Serna N', 'Sanchez-Garcia L', 'Volta-Duran E', 'Morris GA', 'Sanchez-Chardi A', 'Casanova I', 'Mangues R', 'Vazquez E', 'Villaverde A', 'Unzueta U']","['Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Sant Antoni M feminine Claret 167, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), C/Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC Campus Sant Pau), 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Sant Antoni M feminine Claret 167, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), C/Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC Campus Sant Pau), 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Sant Antoni M feminine Claret 167, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), C/Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Sant Antoni M feminine Claret 167, 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), C/Monforte de Lemos 3-5, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC Campus Sant Pau), 08025 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Spain.', 'Departament de Genetica i de Microbiologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Spain.', 'ICTA & Catedra de Quimica Biologica, Departamento de Quimica, Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas y Tecnologicas (IIBYT) (CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Cordoba), FCEFyN, UNC.

(AG) is traditionally used to treat gonorrhea or kidney's problems. The antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticholinesterase and in vitro antitumor activities of AG extracts were recently reported. The aim of this work was to investigate anti-leukemic properties of AG chloroform fraction (AG CHCl3) and of its ten sub-fractions (I-X) and to identify their possible bioactive compounds. We determined their in vitro antioxidant activity using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (SO) assays, and their phytochemical profile by spectrophotometric and LC-MS/MS techniques. I-X action on two acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines viability, apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by MTS, western blotting and cytofluorimetric assays. Different polyphenol, flavonoid and terpenoid amount, and antioxidant activity were found among all samples. Most of I-X induced a dose/time dependent reduction of cell viability higher than parent extract. IV and VI sub-fractions showed highest cytotoxic activity and, of note, a negligible reduction of healthy cell viability. They activated intrinsic apoptotic pathway, induced a G0/G1 block in leukemic cells and, interestingly, led to apoptosis in patient AML cells. These activities could be due to mulinic acid or azorellane terpenoids and their derivatives, tentatively identified in both IV and VI.

Over the past few years, novel insights have emerged about the contribution of adult obesity to cancer risk, but the evidence base is far more limited in children. While pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk of obesity, it is unclear if there are potential causal mechanisms by which obesity leads to ALL development. This review explores the endocrine, metabolic and immune dysregulation triggered by obesity and its potential role in pediatric ALL's genesis. We describe possible mechanisms, including adipose tissue attraction and protection of lymphoblasts, and their impact on ALL chemotherapies' pharmacokinetics. We also explore the potential contribution of cytokines, growth factors, natural killer cells and adipose stem cells to ALL initiation and propagation. While there are no current definite causal links between obesity and ALL, critical questions persist as to whether the adipose tissue microenvironment and endocrine actions can play a causal role in childhood ALL, and there is a need for more research to address these questions.",,"['Dushnicky, Molly J', 'Nazarali, Samina', 'Mir, Adhora', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Samaan, Muder Constantine']","['Dushnicky MJ', 'Nazarali S', 'Mir A', 'Portwine C', 'Samaan MC']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada."", 'Michael G.

We performed a pooled analysis of all published studies with detailed treatment data, including estimated active bone marrow (ABM) dose received during radiation therapy and doses of specific chemotherapeutic agents for childhood cancer diagnosed from 1930 through 2000, in order to more thoroughly investigate treatment-related risks of SPL. A total of 147 SPL cases (of which 69% were acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) were individually matched to 522 controls, all from four case-control studies including patients from six countries (France, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Italy and Netherlands). Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression, and the excess OR per Gray (EOR/Gy) was also calculated. After accounting for the other therapies received, topoisomerase II inhibitor was associated with an increased SPL risk (highest tertile vs none: OR = 10.0, 95% CI: 3.7-27.3). Radiation dose to the ABM was also associated with increased SPL risk among those not receiving chemotherapy (EOR/Gy = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.1-14.3), but not among those who received chemotherapy (CT).

We have previously demonstrated in a multicenter, phase 1 trial conducted through the Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research Consortium that the combination of ruxolitinib and decitabine is safe and tolerable and is associated with a favorable overall survival (OS). In this phase 2 trial, 25 patients with MPN-AP/BP were treated at the recommended phase 2 dose of ruxolitinib 25 mg twice daily for the induction cycle followed by 10 mg twice daily for subsequent cycles in combination with decitabine 20 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days in a 28-day cycle. Nineteen patients died during the study follow-up. The median OS for all patients on study was 9.5 months (95% confidence interval, 4.3-12.0). Overall response rate (complete remission + incomplete platelet recovery + partial remission) was 11/25 (44%) and response was not associated with improved survival.

Histone acetylation and methylation, the most widely studied histone PTMs, act in concert with chromatin-associated proteins to control access to genetic information during transcription. Alterations in cellular histone PTMs have been linked to disease states and have crucial biomarker and therapeutic potential. Traditional bottom-up mass spectrometry of histones requires large numbers of cells, typically one million or more. However, for some cell subtype-specific studies, it is difficult or impossible to obtain such large numbers of cells and quantification of rare histone PTMs is often unachievable. An established targeted LC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the abundance of histone PTMs from cell lines and primary human specimens. Sample preparation was modified by omitting nuclear isolation and reducing the rounds of histone derivatization to improve detection of histone peptides down to 1,000 cells. In the current study, we developed and validated a quantitative LC-MS/MS approach tailored for a targeted histone assay of 75 histone peptides with as few as 10,000 cells. Furthermore, we were able to detect and quantify 61 histone peptides from just 1,000 primary human stem cells. Detection of 37 histone peptides was possible from 1,000 acute myeloid leukemia patient cells.

METHODS: A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The mean age was 55.3 years (SD +/- 21.1). Comorbidities were present in 110 (60.8%) cases. The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. Metastatic disease accounted for 90 (49.7%) cases. In total, 63 (34.8%) had recently received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52 out of 138 patients) and for hematological malignancies, 23.5% (8 out of 34). According to the univariate analysis COVID-19-specific mortality was significantly associated with age over 75 years (P = .002), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or best supportive care intent (P < .001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P = .002), admission due to COVID-19 (P = .009), and antibiotics use (P = .02).

Its malfunction drives several myeloproliferative disorders. Heme is a small metal-ion-carrying molecule that is incorporated into hemoglobin in erythroid precursor cells to transport oxygen. In addition, heme is a signaling molecule and regulator of various biochemical processes. Here, we show that heme exposure leads to hyperphosphorylation of JAK2 in a myeloid cancer cell line. Two peptides identified in JAK2 are heme-regulatory motifs and show low-micromolar affinities for heme. These peptides map to the kinase domain of JAK2, which is essential for downstream signaling. We suggest these motifs to be the interaction sites of heme with JAK2, which drive the heme-induced hyperphosphorylation.

Recently, three indisputable biomarkers have been described for the diagnostic support for MM, which are: more than 10% of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow or, a biopsy that corroborates the presence of a plasmacytoma, light chain ratio >/= 100 mg/dL and more than one focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. A differential diagnosis for plasma cell leukemia, solitary bone plasmacytoma, and extramedullary plasmacytoma should always be considered. Being this an incurable disease, a lot of research has been done regarding its therapeutic management, whose main objective is the disappearance of plasma cells and the patient clinical improvement. Melphalan was the first drug that showed a benefit in 1958 and afterward, with the addition of a steroid as a second drug, it was possible to improve response rates. Subsequently, different molecules were studied, forming multiple combinations, and achieving better rates of overall survival and progression-free survival. Years later, with the arrival of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and immunomodulators such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, an important turnaround in the disease has been seen, as deeper responses, more prolonged remissions, and improvement in the quality of life of patients have been achieved. This consensus has the purpose of integrating a group of Mexican specialists and promoting the updating of this pathology.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Permanyer.'],"['de la Pena-Celaya, Jose A', 'Aguilar-Luevano, Jocelyn', 'Alcivar-Cedeno, Luisa Ma', 'Alvarez-Vera, Jose L', 'Anaya-Cuellar, Irene', 'Anorve-Hernandez, Erika', 'Arana-Luna, Luara L', 'Arteaga-Ortiz, Luis', 'Baez-Islas, Pamela E', 'Banda-Garcia, Luisa I', 'Bates-Martin, Ramon A', 'Campa-Monroy, Dafne Itzel', 'Cardiel-Silva, Mariela', 'Castillo-Salas, Angel de Jesus', 'Cota-Rangel, Xochitl', 'Diaz-Vargas, Guillermo', 'Espitia-Rios, M Eugenia', 'Estrada-Dominguez, Patricia', 'Fermin-Caminero, Denisse', 'Garcia-Camacho, Alinka', 'Garcia-Castillo, Carolina', 'Garzon-Velasquez, Katheryn B', 'Gil-Rondero, Carlos', 'Guerra-Alarcon, Lidia V', 'Hernandez-Colin, Ana K', 'Hernandez-Ruiz, Eleazar', 'Hernandez-Alcantara, Areli E', 'Hernandez-Cervantes, Silvia A', 'Herrera-Olivares, Wilfrido', 'Ignacio-Ibarra, Gregorio', 'Inclan-Alarcon, Sergio I', 'Leyto-Cruz, Faustino', 'Macias-Flores, Juan P', 'Vega, Andrea Martinez-de la', 'Martinez-Ramirez, Mario Alberto', 'Martinez-Coronel, Jorge', 'Medina-Coral, Jesus Emanuel', 'Meza-Davalos, Lizeth', 'Montoya-Jimenez, Leire', 'Morales-Hernandez, Alba', 'Morales-Lopez, Elizabeth', 'Morales-Adrian, Javier de Jesus', 'Azcue, Maricruz Morales-de', 'Mujica-Martinez, Aldo', 'Murillo-Cruz, Juan L', 'Najera-Martinez, Jessica', 'Narvaez-Sarmiento, Iris Mabel', 'Nava-Villegas, Lorena', 'Nava-Alpide, Marco A', 'Orellana Garibay, Juan J', 'Palafox-Zaldivar, Ma Teresa', 'Palma-Moreno, Orlando G', 'Paredes-Lozano, Eugenia P', 'Pedraza-Colin, Ma Luisa', 'Perez-Zuniga, Juan M', 'Perez-Lizardi, Alejandra B', 'Rojas-Castillejos, Flavio', 'Romero-Martinez, Eduardo', 'Romero-Rodelo, Hilda', 'Ruiz-Contreras, Josue', 'Saavedra-Gonzalez, Azucena', 'Saucedo-Montes, Erick', 'Silva-Michel, Luis G', 'Silva-Vera, Karina', 'Teomitzi-Sanchez, Oscar', 'Tepepa-Flores, Fredy', 'Ventura-Enriquez, Yanet', 'Villela-Pena, Atenas', 'Vilchis-Gonzalez, Shendel P', 'Zapata-Canto, Nidia', 'Zarate-Rodriguez, Pedro A', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, Martha']","['de la Pena-Celaya JA', 'Aguilar-Luevano J', 'Alcivar-Cedeno LM', 'Alvarez-Vera JL', 'Anaya-Cuellar I', 'Anorve-Hernandez E', 'Arana-Luna LL', 'Arteaga-Ortiz L', 'Baez-Islas PE', 'Banda-Garcia LI', 'Bates-Martin RA', 'Campa-Monroy DI', 'Cardiel-Silva M', 'Castillo-Salas AJ', 'Cota-Rangel X', 'Diaz-Vargas G', 'Espitia-Rios ME', 'Estrada-Dominguez P', 'Fermin-Caminero D', 'Garcia-Camacho A', 'Garcia-Castillo C', 'Garzon-Velasquez KB', 'Gil-Rondero C', 'Guerra-Alarcon LV', 'Hernandez-Colin AK', 'Hernandez-Ruiz E', 'Hernandez-Alcantara AE', 'Hernandez-Cervantes SA', 'Herrera-Olivares W', 'Ignacio-Ibarra G', 'Inclan-Alarcon SI', 'Leyto-Cruz F', 'Macias-Flores JP', 'Vega AM', 'Martinez-Ramirez MA', 'Martinez-Coronel J', 'Medina-Coral JE', 'Meza-Davalos L', 'Montoya-Jimenez L', 'Morales-Hernandez A', 'Morales-Lopez E', 'Morales-Adrian JJ', 'Azcue MM', 'Mujica-Martinez A', 'Murillo-Cruz JL', 'Najera-Martinez J', 'Narvaez-Sarmiento IM', 'Nava-Villegas L', 'Nava-Alpide MA', 'Orellana Garibay JJ', 'Palafox-Zaldivar MT', 'Palma-Moreno OG', 'Paredes-Lozano EP', 'Pedraza-Colin ML', 'Perez-Zuniga JM', 'Perez-Lizardi AB', 'Rojas-Castillejos F', 'Romero-Martinez E', 'Romero-Rodelo H', 'Ruiz-Contreras J', 'Saavedra-Gonzalez A', 'Saucedo-Montes E', 'Silva-Michel LG', 'Silva-Vera K', 'Teomitzi-Sanchez O', 'Tepepa-Flores F', 'Ventura-Enriquez Y', 'Villela-Pena A', 'Vilchis-Gonzalez SP', 'Zapata-Canto N', 'Zarate-Rodriguez PA', 'Alvarado-Ibarra M']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE Ciudad de Mexico.

The colon adenocarcinoma C26c20 cell line secretes the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which induces cachexia. We characterized how LIF promotes cachexia-associated weight loss and anorexia in mice through JAK-dependent changes in adipose and hypothalamic tissues. Methods: Cachexia was induced in vivo with the heterotopic allotransplanted administration of C26c20 colon adenocarcinoma cells or the intraperitoneal administration of recombinant LIF in the absence or presence of JAK inhibitors. Blood, adipose, and hypothalamic tissues were collected and processed for cyto/adipokine ELISAs, immunoblot analysis, and quantitative RT-PCR. Cachexia-associated lipolysis was induced in vitro by stimulating differentiated adipocytes with recombinant LIF or IL-6 in the absence or presence of lipase or JAK inhibitors. These adipocytes were processed for glycerol release into the media, immunoblot analysis, and RT-PCR. Results: Tumor-secreted LIF induced changes in adipose tissue expression and serum levels of IL-6 and leptin in a JAK-dependent manner influencing cachexia-associated adipose wasting and anorexia. We identified two JAK inhibitors that block IL-6 family-mediated adipocyte lipolysis and IL-6 induction using an in vitro cachexia lipolysis assay. JAK inhibitors administered to the in vivo C26c20 cancer cachexia mouse models led to 1) a decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation in hypothalamic and adipose tissues, 2) a reverse in the cachexia serum cyto/adipokine signature, 3) a delay in cancer cachexia-associated anorexia and adipose loss, and 4) an improvement in overall survival. Conclusions: JAK inhibitors suppress LIF-associated adipose loss and anorexia in both in vitro and in vivo models of cancer cachexia.",,"['Arora, Gurpreet', 'Gupta, Arun', 'Guo, Tong', 'Gandhi, Aakash', 'Laine, Aaron', 'Williams, Dorothy', 'Ahn, Chul', 'Iyengar, Puneeth', 'Infante, Rodney']","['Arora G', 'Gupta A', 'Guo T', 'Gandhi A', 'Laine A', 'Williams D', 'Ahn C', 'Iyengar P', 'Infante R']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Human Nutrition, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Human Nutrition, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Harold C.

AML in DS children (ML-DS) is characterized by the pathognomonic mutation in the gene encoding the essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1, resulting in N-terminally truncated short form of GATA1 (GATA1s). Trisomy 21 and GATA1s together are sufficient to induce transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) exhibiting pre-leukemic characteristics. Approximately 30% of these cases progress into ML-DS by acquisition of additional somatic mutations. We employed disease modeling in vitro by the use of customizable induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate a TAM model. Isogenic iPSC lines derived from the fibroblasts of DS individuals with trisomy 21 and with disomy 21 were used. The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 system was used to introduce GATA1 mutation in disomic and trisomic iPSC lines. The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from GATA1 mutant iPSC lines expressed GATA1s. The expression of GATA1s concomitant with loss of full-length GATA1 reduced the erythroid population, whereas it augmented megakaryoid and myeloid populations, characteristic of TAM. In conclusion, we have developed a model system representing TAM, which can be used for modeling ML-DS by stepwise introduction of additional mutations.",['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Barwe, Sonali P', 'Sidhu, Ishnoor', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar']","['Barwe SP', 'Sidhu I', 'Kolb EA', 'Gopalakrishnapillai A']","['Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, A.I.

Recent studies have identified that the expression of TIGIT, CD57, and KLRG1 is related to the function, maturation, and antitumor capabilities of NK cells. However, the characteristics of the expression of these genes in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from patients with CML remain unknown. In this study, we used multicolor flow cytometry to assay the quantity and phenotypic changes of NK cells in PB and BM from de novo CML (DN-CML) and CML patients acquiring molecular response (MR-CML). We found that the expression of TIGIT, which inhibits NK cell function, is increased on CD56(+) and CD56(dim) NK cells in DN-CML PB compared with those in healthy individuals (HIs), and it is restored to normal in patients who achieve MR. We also found that the expression of CD57 on NK cells was approximately the same level in PB and BM from DN-CML patients, while decreased CD57 expression was found on CD56(+) and CD56(dim) NK cells in HI BM compared with PB. Additionally, those two subsets were significantly increased in DN-CML BM compared to HI BM. The expression of CD57 correlates with replicative senescence and maturity for human NK cells; therefore, the increase in TIGIT on PB NK cells together with an increase in CD57 on BM NK cells may explain the subdued NK cell antileukemia capacity and proliferative ability in DN-CML patients. These results indicate that reversing the immune suppression of PB NK cells by blocking TIGIT while improving the proliferation of BM NK cells via targeting CD57 may be more effective in removing tumor cells.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Danlin Yao et al.'],"['Yao, Danlin', 'Xu, Ling', 'Liu, Lian', 'Zeng, Xiangbo', 'Zhong, Juan', 'Lai, Jing', 'Zheng, Runhui', 'Jin, Zhenyi', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Huang, Xin', 'Lu, Yuhong']","['Yao D', 'Xu L', 'Liu L', 'Zeng X', 'Zhong J', 'Lai J', 'Zheng R', 'Jin Z', 'Chen S', 'Zha X', 'Huang X', 'Lu Y']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Clinical Medicine Postdoctoral Research Station, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (TIGIT protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'CD57 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/physiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC7578715,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.'],2020/10/27 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/10/26 05:27'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 05:27 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/9531549 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Oct 13;2020:9531549. doi: 10.1155/2020/9531549. eCollection 2020.,9531549,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0963-8700', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7044-7663', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9388-982X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3176-8800', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8459-0850', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7515-1637', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3812-3626', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4945-5914', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4970-1305', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9115-5766', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9017-2185']",20201013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer chemotherapy is associated with the occurrence of ADRs, which is a worldwide problem. Monitoring and reporting of these ADRs are essential to safeguard the patient and to manage it accordingly. The outcome would create alertness and prevent their recurrence. Hence, we have undertaken a hospital-based study to study the frequency and nature of ADRs due to chemotherapeutic agents. Methods: A total of 500 patients developed ADRs due to cancer chemotherapy from 13(th) April 2018 to 18(th) September 2019. Demographics of the patient, drugs taken, and ADRs encountered were recorded in a predesigned form. Results: A total of 665 ADRs were recorded from 500 patients. Anemia was the most common ADR encountered followed by nausea/vomiting and leucopenia. Leukemia (s) were common cancer observed followed by lung and breast cancers. The most common drugs implicated were cisplatin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and doxorubicin. Naranjo's scale showed 92% of ADRs as probable and 7% as possible. Severity scale showed 80.2% of ADRs were of moderate (level 3 and 4) severity, 11.6% of mild (level 1 and 2) severity, and 8.2% of level 5 severity. A total of 26.8% of ADRs were deemed preventable and 73.2% were not preventable. Conclusions: Our study provides safety data regarding the usage of anti-cancer drugs. Hence, it creates alertness among the treating doctors to prevent its recurrence.",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],"['Ramasubbu, Saravana Kumar', 'Pasricha, Rajesh K', 'Nath, Uttam K', 'Das, Biswadeep']","['Ramasubbu SK', 'Pasricha RK', 'Nath UK', 'Das B']","['Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Virbhadra Road, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Virbhadra Road, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Virbhadra Road, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Virbhadra Road, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,J Family Med Prim Care,Journal of family medicine and primary care,101610082,,,,PMC7567243,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],2020/10/27 06:00,2020/10/27 06:01,['2020/10/26 05:26'],"['2020/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 05:26 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_352_20 [doi]', 'JFMPC-9-3349 [pii]']",epublish,J Family Med Prim Care. 2020 Jul 30;9(7):3349-3355. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_352_20. eCollection 2020 Jul.,3349-3355,,20200730,['NOTNLM'],"['ADRs', 'India', 'cancer chemotherapy', 'preventability', 'severity', 'teaching hospital']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mapping accurately the CTA gene expression signature in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a prerequisite for downstream immune target-discovery projects. In this study, we take advantage of the use of azacitidine to treat high-risk MDS and CMML to draw the CTAs landscape, before and after treatment, using an ad hoc targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) design for this group of low transcript genes. In 19 patients, 196 CTAs were detected at baseline. Azacitidine did not change the number of CTAs expressed, but it significantly increased or decreased expression in nine and five CTAs, respectively. TFDP3 and DDX53, emerged as the main candidates for immunotherapeutic targeting, as they showed three main features: i) a significant derepression on day +28 of cycle one in those patients who achieved complete remission with hypomethylating treatment (FC = 6, p = .008; FC = 2.1, p = .008, respectively), ii) similar dynamics at the protein level to what was observed at the RNA layer, and iii) to elicit significant specific cytotoxic immune responses detected by TFDP3 and DDX53 HLA-A*0201 tetramers. Our study addresses the unmet landscape of CTAs expression in MDS and CMML and revealed a previously unrecognized TFDP3 and DDX53 reactivation, detectable in plasma and able to elicit a specific immune response after one cycle of azacitidine.","['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

Preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) is an attractive target overexpressed in several cancers including melanoma and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with low expression in normal tissue outside the gonads. We developed a GMP-compliant manufacturing method for PRAME-specific T cells from healthy donors for adoptive immunotherapy. Methods: Mononuclear cells were pulsed with PRAME 15-mer overlapping peptide mix. After 16 h, activated cells expressing CD137 were isolated with immunomagnetic beads and cocultured with irradiated CD137(neg) fraction in medium supplemented with interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7 and IL-15. Cultured T cells were restimulated with antigen-pulsed autologous cells after 10 days. Cellular phenotype and cytokine response following antigen re-exposure were assessed with flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and supernatant cytokine detection. Detailed phenotypic and functional analysis with mass cytometry and T-cell receptor (TCR) beta clonality studies were performed on selected cultures. Results: PRAME-stimulated cultures (n = 10) had mean expansion of 2500-fold at day 18. Mean CD3(+) percentage was 96% with CD4:CD8 ratio of 4:1. Re-exposure to PRAME peptide mixture showed enrichment of CD4 cells expressing interferon (IFN)-gamma (mean: 12.2%) and TNF-alpha (mean: 19.7%). Central and effector memory cells were 23% and 72%, respectively, with 24% T cells expressing PD1. Mass cytometry showed predominance of Th1 phenotype (CXCR3(+)/CCR4(neg)/CCR6(neg)/Tbet(+), mean: 73%) and cytokine production including IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-13 and GM-CSF (2%, 6%, 8%, 4% and 11%, respectively). Conclusion: PRAME-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy were enriched from healthy donor mononuclear cells. The products were oligoclonal, exhibited Th1 phenotype and produced multiple cytokines.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The most severe adverse events known in HU therapy are leg ulcers and cutaneous carcinomas. At skin level may also appear: xerosis, persistent pruritus, skin color changes (erythema, hyperpigmentation), cutaneous atrophy. Likewise, oral ulcerations and stomatitis may occur at mucosal level. Hair damage can be expressed through alopecia and nail damage through melanonychia and oncycholysis. First case, a 63-year-old woman with severe psoriasis vulgaris and chronic granulocytic leukemia, with 5 years of HU therapy, was admitted to hospital for submammary and palmoplantar ulcers, superinfected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Clinical exam showed that the patient had also cutaneous atrophy, marked palmoplantar xerosis and melanonychia. The second case, a 72-year-old woman with primary thrombocytemia, treated with HU for 3 years, presented with necrotic leg ulcers that were superinfected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter and E. Coli. The patient associates cellulitis, microbial eczema and xeroderma. In both cases, after HU discontinuation, systemic antibiotics, topical epithelizing agents and emollients, the ulcers had a slow favorable evolution. In our cases, the ulcers appeared after 5, respectively 3 years of HU therapy. It is stressed that in the first case, which had associated psoriasis, after 1 year of 1 g of HU/day, the psoriatic lesions completely disappeared. The severe progression of the ulcers was also favored by the superinfection of the ulcers with 2, respectively, 3 identified germs for which appropriate systemic antibiotics was required.",['Copyright: (c) Iancu et al.'],"['Iancu, Gabriela Mariana', 'Ocneanu, Anca', 'Rotaru, Maria']","['Iancu GM', 'Ocneanu A', 'Rotaru M']","['Dermatology Department, Faculty of Medicine, University Lucian Blaga of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.', 'Clinic of Dermatology, County Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.', 'Dermatology Office, Grivita Medical Center, 810521 Braila, Romania.', 'Dermatology Department, Faculty of Medicine, University Lucian Blaga of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.', 'Clinic of Dermatology, County Emergency Hospital of Sibiu, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,PMC7579764,,2020/10/27 06:00,2020/10/27 06:01,['2020/10/26 05:23'],"['2020/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 05:23 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2020.9321 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-09321 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2020 Dec;20(6):191. doi: 10.3892/etm.2020.9321.

Cord blood transplantation (CBT) results in less relapses and less graft-versus-host disease when compared to other sources. Nevertheless, still more than half of the children die from relapses. We therefore designed a strategy to prevent relapses by inducing anti-AML immunity after CBT, using a CB-derived dendritic cell (CBDC) vaccine generated from CD34+ CB cells from the same graft. We here describe the optimization and validation of good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade production of the CBDC vaccine. We show the feasibility of expanding low amounts of CD34+ cells in a closed bag system to sufficient DCs per patient for at least three rounds of vaccinations. The CBDCs showed upregulated costimulatory molecules after maturation and showed enhanced CCR7-dependent migration toward CCL19 in a trans-well migrations assay. CBDCs expressed Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) protein after electroporation with WT1-mRNA, but were not as potent as CBDCs loaded with synthetic long peptides (peptivator). The WT1-peptivator loaded CBDCs were able to stimulate T-cells both in a mixed lymphocyte reaction as well as in an antigen-specific (autologous) setting. The autologous stimulated T-cells lysed not only the WT1+ cell line, but most importantly, also primary pediatric AML cells. Altogether, we provide a GMP-protocol of a highly mature CBDC vaccine, loaded with WT1 peptivator and able to stimulate autologous T-cells in an antigen-specific manner. Finally, these T-cells lysed primary pediatric AML demonstrating the competence of the CBDC vaccine strategy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Plantinga, Lo Presti, de Haar, Dunnebach, Madrigal, Lindemans,', 'Boelens and Nierkens.']","['Plantinga, Maud', 'Lo Presti, Vania', 'de Haar, Colin G', 'Dunnebach, Ester', 'Madrigal, Alejandro', 'Lindemans, Caroline A', 'Boelens, Jaap Jan', 'Nierkens, Stefan']","['Plantinga M', 'Lo Presti V', 'de Haar CG', 'Dunnebach E', 'Madrigal A', 'Lindemans CA', 'Boelens JJ', 'Nierkens S']","['Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Pharmacy Department, Cell Therapy Facility, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Stem Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.', 'Center for Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Utrecht, Netherlands.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Biomarkers', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/immunology']",PMC7546401,,2020/10/27 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/10/26 05:22'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 05:22 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.559152 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Sep 25;11:559152. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.559152. eCollection 2020.,559152,,20200925,['NOTNLM'],"['*cord blood', '*dendritic cells', '*good manufacturing practice', '*immunotherapy', '*transplantation', '*vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Machine learning-based automated gene data classification is an essential aspect for diagnosis of gene related any malfunctions and diseases. As the size of the data is very large, it is essential to design a suitable classifier that can process huge amount of data. Deep learning is one of the advanced machine learning techniques to mitigate these types of problems. Due the presence of more number of hidden layers, it can easily handle the big amount of data. We have presented a method of classification to understand the convergence of training deep neural network (DNN). The assumptions are taken as the inputs do not degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. Also the number of hidden neurons is sufficiently large. Authors in this piece of work have used DNN for classifying the gene expressions data. The dataset used in the work contains the bone marrow expressions of 72 leukemia patients. A five-layer DNN classifier is designed for classifying acute lymphocyte (ALL) and acute myelocytic (AML) samples. The network is trained with 80% data and rest 20% data is considered for validation purpose. Proposed DNN classifier is providing a satisfactory result as compared to other classifiers. Two types of leukemia are classified with 98.2% accuracy, 96.59% sensitivity, and 97.9% specificity. The different types of computer-aided analyses of genes can be helpful to genetic and virology researchers as well in future generation.","['(c) Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2020.']","['Mallick, Pradeep Kumar', 'Mohapatra, Saumendra Kumar', 'Chae, Gyoo-Soo', 'Mohanty, Mihir Narayan']","['Mallick PK', 'Mohapatra SK', 'Chae GS', 'Mohanty MN']","['School of Computer Engineering, KIIT (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha India.', ""Department of Computer Science and Engineering, ITER, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha India."", 'Division of Information and Communication Engineering, Baekseok University, Cheonan, 330-704 South Korea.grid.443819.30000 0004 1791 9611', ""Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, ITER, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha India.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Pers Ubiquitous Comput,Personal and ubiquitous computing,101628392,,,,PMC7567412,,2020/10/27 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2020/10/26 05:20'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 05:20 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00779-020-01467-3 [doi]', '1467 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Pers Ubiquitous Comput. 2020 Oct 16:1-8. doi: 10.1007/s00779-020-01467-3.,1-8,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1252-949X'],20201016,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'DNN', 'Deep learning', 'Gene expression', 'Microarray']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EGFR expression has been reported in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), however, many other reports nullified EGFR expression in AML. These contradictory data prompted us to reevaluate the expression of EGFR in AML and carry out a comparative survival analysis between EGFR expressing and non-expressing AML patients (Children and Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia patients excluded). Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples were collected from 60 adult patients with AML with written informed consent. PCR, Real-Time Taqman gene expression assays were used for the detection of genetic alterations. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (IBM SPSS 20). In our study, EGFR expression was detected in 21 out of 60, in 35% (95% C.I. 23.45-48.48) AML patients. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with EGFR (p = < 0.01), with an average survival of 18.57 months (95% C.I. 12.42-24.73 months) compared with 31.27 months (95% C.I. 28.19-34.33 months) in patients without EGFR. EGFR expression was significantly higher in female patients compared to male (p = 0.037).This study confirms the presence of EGFR in AML and indicates that EGFR expression confers poor prognosis in AML. However, the underlying cause of this adverse prognostic effect has not been identified. Further clinical studies are warranted to determine the exact mechanism through which EGFR activity might contribute to AML progression and identify the potential therapeutic target for the reversal of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.",['(c) Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion 2020.'],"['Nath, Sukanta', 'Bhattacharyya, Jina', 'Sarma, Partha Pratim', 'Saxena, Renu', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Barman, Manash Pratim', 'Saikia, Kandarpa Kumar']","['Nath S', 'Bhattacharyya J', 'Sarma PP', 'Saxena R', 'Sazawal S', 'Barman MP', 'Saikia KK']","['Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, 781014 Assam India.grid.411779.d0000 0001 2109 4622', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, India.grid.415311.30000 0004 1800 5512', 'Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, 781014 Assam India.grid.411779.d0000 0001 2109 4622', 'Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Statistics, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh, India.grid.412023.60000 0001 0674 667X', 'Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, 781014 Assam India.grid.411779.d0000 0001 2109 4622']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC7572979,"['Conflict of interestSukanta Nath, Jina Bhattacharya, Partha Pratim Sarma, Renu', 'Saxena, Sudha Sazawal, Manash Pratim Barman and Kandarpa Saikia declare that they', 'have no conflict of interest.']",2020/10/27 06:00,2020/10/27 06:01,['2020/10/26 05:19'],"['2019/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 05:19 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01274-z [doi]', '1274 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Oct;36(4):749-753. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01274-z.

In addition, there is paucity of data on the impact of BCR-ABL1 transcript variants on clinical presentation and survival in CML patients in Nigeria. The BCR-ABL1 transcript variants were analyzed in 230 Imatinib-treated CML patients at diagnosis. Patients with incomplete data (n = 28), e19a2 (n = 3) and e1a2 (n = 1) were excluded from analysis of transcript variant on disease presentation and survival leaving only 198. The frequencies of BCR-ABL1 transcript variants were 30 (13.0%), 114 (49.6%), 82 (35.7%), three (1.3%) and one (0.4%) for e13a2, e14a2, co-expression of e13a2/e14a2, e19a2 and e1a2, respectively. A significantly higher platelet count was found in patients with e13a2 variant (531.1 +/- 563.4 x 10(9)/L) than in those expressing e14a2 (488.2 +/- 560.3 x 10(9)/L) or e13a2/e14a2 (320.7 +/- 215.8 x 10(9)/L); p = 0.03.

The virus is endemic in the parts of Iran. This study is conducted to determine the trends in the frequency of HTLV-I in Mashhad, a city in Khorasan-e Razavi province, Iran, over 11 years. Materials and Methods: Blood bank records of blood donors positive for HTLV-I were collected from different blood banks across Mashhad between 2002 and 2013. Obtained data were first entered into paper versions and then were analyzed by SPSS version 11.5. HTLV-I antibody was firstly measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and later confirmed by the Western Blot (WB). Results: During the study period, 983,000 donors were examined by ELISA and WB, among whom 2921 cases (0.297%) were positive HTLV-I carriers. The highest and lowest frequency of carriers was 0.451% and 0.098%, respectively. The most significant factor was related to marital status (85.2%) and the smallest significant factor was associated with the history of acupuncture (0.3%) according to the different risk factors. Conclusion: The frequency of HTLV-I carriers among blood donors was significantly decreased in this period.

Many of these drugs were developed to treat acute myeloid leukemia, a condition in which dysregulation of the epigenetic landscape is well established. While these drugs have shown promise, critical issues persist. Specifically, patients with the same mutations respond quite differently to treatment. This is true even with highly specific drugs that are designed to target the underlying oncogenic driver mutations. Furthermore, patients who do respond may eventually develop resistance. There is now evidence that epigenetic heterogeneity contributes, in part, to these issues. Cancer cells also have a remarkable capacity to 'rewire' themselves at the epigenetic level in response to drug treatment, and thereby maintain expression of key oncogenes. This epigenetic plasticity is a promising new target for drug development. It is therefore important to consider combination therapy in cases in which both driver mutations and epigenetic plasticity are targeted. Using ascorbate as an example of an emerging epigenetic therapeutic, we review the evidence for its potential use in both of these modes. We provide an overview of 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases with DNA, histone and RNA demethylase activity, focusing on those which require ascorbate as a cofactor. We also evaluate their role in the development and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia. Using this information, we highlight situations in which the use of ascorbate to restore 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase activity could prove beneficial, in contrast to contexts in which targeted inhibition of specific enzymes might be preferred. Finally, we discuss how these insights could be incorporated into the rational design of future clinical trials.",,"['Das, Andrew B', 'Smith-Diaz, Carlos C', 'Vissers, Margreet C M']","['Das AB', 'Smith-Diaz CC', 'Vissers MCM']","['Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch. andrew.das@otago.ac.nz.', 'Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch.', 'Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago, Christchurch.']",['eng'],,"[""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Carcinogenesis', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Epigenomics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics']",PMC7776339,,2020/10/27 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2020/10/26 04:14'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/26 04:14 [entrez]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.259283 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Jan 1;106(1):14-25. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.259283.,14-25,,20210101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The miR-320a mimic was transfected into A375 cells, and the functions of cells were detected. The luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to verify the miR-320a downstream target protein predicted by the biological information prediction software. RESULTS: The differential analysis of miRNAs in melanoma tissues from TCGA database showed that miR-320a expression in melanoma tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent tissues, and low expression of miR-320a exhibited a severe poor prognosis (p<0.01). MiR-320a mimic could significantly enhance the expression level of miR-320a (p<0.01). The absorbance at 490 nm of A375 cells overexpressing miR-320a decreased remarkably and their proliferation ability was weakened (p<0.01). Overexpression of miR-320a in A375 cells inhibited cell migration to wound parts and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invading malignant phenotype (p<0.05). Flow cytometry was employed and it was denoted that after transfecting with miR-320a, the apoptosis rate of A375 cells was elevated overtly (p<0.01). The dual luciferase report test indicated that the luciferase activity in wild type pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) was markedly lower than that of mutant type PBX 3 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted binding of miR-320a to PBX3 protein can inhibit the malignant phenotype of cells and affects the occurrence and development of melanoma.",,"['Fu, Guili', 'Lu, Jingjing', 'Zheng, Yuanquan', 'Wang, Pan', 'Shen, Qin']","['Fu G', 'Lu J', 'Zheng Y', 'Wang P', 'Shen Q']","[""Department of Dermatology, Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital), Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MIRN320 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,2020/10/26 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2020/10/25 20:18'],"['2020/10/25 20:18 [entrez]', '2020/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2020 Jul-Aug;25(4):2071-2077.,2071-2077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The human leukemia cell lines TCCY, KU-812, TCC-S, KOPB-26, and HL60 were used. The crude ethanol extracts of 17 medicinal plants were collected and evaluated for their cytotoxicity against these leukemia cell lines by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Morphological changes of cells were observed under phase-contrast inverted microscope. Bioactive compounds were evaluated using the method described by Ciulei. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method was carried out for evaluating the antioxidant effect. RESULTS: Among the tested samples, Artemisia vulgaris (A.vulgaris) crude ethanol extract effectively inhibited the viability of leukemia cell in both dose and time-dependent manner. The IC50 value was different for cell lines and ranged from 18.07+/-1.64 microg/ml to 45.87+/-3.49 microg/ml. Moreover, the phytoconstituents analysis results showed coumarin, flavonoid, anthocyanin, cardiac glycoside, tannins, reduced sugar compounds were present in the A.vulgaris extract. The total polyphenol and fl avonoid contents of the dry extract were calculated as 3.81 mg GAE/g dry weight and 11.64 mg RUE/g dry weight of A.vulgaris. A.vulgaris exhibited antioxidant activity with IC50 is 145.10 +/- 6.34 microg/ml.

METHODS: Cases with both de novo or secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) were retrieved. Data from flow cytometry immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, molecular studies, and clinical presentation were analyzed. RESULTS: Cases presented with abnormal coagulation parameters and low platelets count; four of them showed a DIC index compatible with overt DIC. Two cases showed Auer rods. In all cases, immunophenotypes mimicked APL: blasts expressed CD33, CD13, and cytoplasmic MPO but did not express CD34, HLA-DR, or CD11b. Notably, CD4 expression was observed in all cases. Neither t(15;17) nor PML/RARalpha gene rearrangement was detected. NPM1 gene mutation was identified in all cases. In four cases, TET2 or IDH2 co-mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional evidence of association between NPM1-mutated AML with TET2 or IDH2 co-mutations and the APL-like immunophenotype. This AML subset was found to exist in both de novo and secondary AML. High WBC count and blasts with low to moderate side scatter and significant expression of CD4 are observed features that could assist in the differential diagnosis with APL.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentations and management of a rare dermatologic condition associated with hematological malignancies. METHODS: Case series; Chart review of patients at Moffitt Cancer Center between 2017 and 2020. RESULTS: The subjects are a 79 year-old man (Patient 1) with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a 66 year-old woman (Patient 2) with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a 56 year-old man (Patient 3) with AML, and a 69 year-old man (Patient 4) with MDS. Patient 1 was initially misdiagnosed with neutropenic fever. Patient 2 was incidentally discovered to have erythematous skin lesions prior to initiating chemotherapy. Before starting second line chemotherapy, patient 3 developed pathergy at the site of a PICC line. Patient 4 developed erythema around a newly placed port before initiating chemotherapy. Only patients 1 and 3 received glucocorticoids. Patients 2, 3, and 4 were able to initiate chemotherapy without further complications. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of subjects in terms of prognostic factors, stage at diagnosis, and treatment strategies.

A HOXB13 pGly84Glu variant carrier was identified in a set of Utah individuals born more than 100 years ago who were members of high-risk cancer pedigrees. The proband carrier was diagnosed with colon cancer and is a member of a high-risk prostate cancer pedigree. The HOXB13 pGLY84Glu variant was assayed in other sampled relatives in the pedigree and was observed to segregate in relatives of the proband carrier in the extended pedigree; this pedigree showed significant excess of prostate cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer among descendants. Multiple additional variant carriers were identified, diagnosed with prostate, bladder, and colon cancers in the 5-generation high-risk cancer pedigree. This study shows the power and efficiency of a biorepository of samples with known genealogy from extended high-risk pedigrees for definition of cancer-associated risks.

We report experience with commercial blinatumomab and inotuzumab use at two North American pediatric oncology centers in children and adolescents/young adults with B-ALL. PROCEDURE: Patients 0-25 years old treated with the CD19 x CD3 bispecific T cell-engaging antibody blinatumomab and/or the CD22 antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab from January 1, 2010, to June 1, 2018, were eligible. Disease status included relapsed B-ALL in second or greater relapse, primary chemotherapy-refractory B-ALL, or B-ALL complicated by severe infection precluding delivery of conventional chemotherapy. RESULTS: We identified 27 patients who received blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab outside of clinical trials during the study period. Four of the 13 patients (31%) with relapsed disease achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remission, and five patients (39%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In the 12 patients with primary chemorefractory B-ALL treated with immunotherapy, 11 (92%) achieved MRD-negative remission as assessed by flow cytometry; 10 patients (83%) underwent subsequent HSCT. Two patients with B-ALL in MRD-negative remission received blinatumomab due to severe infection and remained in remission after chemotherapy continuation. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab and inotuzumab can induce deep remissions in patients with rrALL and facilitate subsequent HSCT or other cellular therapies. Blinatumomab can also serve as an effective bridging therapy during severe infection. The optimal timing, choice of immunotherapeutic agent(s), and duration of responses require further investigation via larger-scale clinical trials.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Contreras, Cristina F', 'Higham, Christine S', 'Behnert, Astrid', 'Kim, Kailyn', 'Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Tasian, Sarah K']","['Contreras CF', 'Higham CS', 'Behnert A', 'Kim K', 'Stieglitz E', 'Tasian SK']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital and School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco, California."", ""San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital and School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital and School of Medicine, Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, California."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['1U01CA232486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA232486/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Young Adult']",PMC7688575,,2020/10/25 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/10/24 17:06'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/24 17:06 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28718 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Jan;68(1):e28718. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28718.

While ATL pathogenesis has been associated with HTLV-1-derived oncogenic proteins, including Tax and HBZ, the contribution of genomic aberrations remains poorly defined. METHODS: To elucidate the genomic basis of ATL, whole exome sequencing was performed on cells from 47 patients with aggressive ATL. RESULTS: We discovered the novel mutation RLTPR Q575E in four patients (8.5%) with a median variant allele frequency of 0.52 (range 0.11-0.68). Despite being reported in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, three ATL patients carrying RLTPR Q575E lacked skin involvement. Patients carrying RLTPR Q575E also harbored CARD11 (75%), PLCG1 (25%), PRKCB (25%), or IKBKB (25%) mutations related to TCR/NF-kappaB signaling. Jurkat cells transfected with RLTPR Q575E cDNA displayed increased NF-kappaB activity and significantly increased IL-2 mRNA levels under stimulation. RLTPR Q575E increased the interaction between RLTPR and CARD11, while RLTPR directly interacted with Tax. CONCLUSIONS: We identified, and functionally validated, a novel gain-of-function mutation in patients with aggressive ATL. During TCR activation by Tax or gain-of-function mutations, RLTPR Q575E selectively upregulates NF-kappaB signaling and may exert oncogenic effects on ATL pathogenesis.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Studies in mice have identified a subset of CD8 T cells that is essential for response to PD-1 ICB. These CD8 T cells co-express CXCR5, PD-1 and Tcf1, and provide effector T cells upon PD-1 ICB. It is unknown whether similar T cells play a role in PD-1 ICB in humans. We studied human peripheral blood and lymph nodes (LNs) for the frequency, phenotype, and functionality of CXCR5(+) PD-1(+) CD8 T cells. We find that CXCR5(+) PD-1(+) CD8 T cells are memory-like cells, express Tcf1, and lack expression of effector molecules. CXCR5(+) PD-1(+) CD8 T cells produce cytokines upon stimulation, but have limited proliferative capacity. We studied patients with hematologic malignancies with varying response rates to PD-1 ICB. Specifically in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which PD-1 ICB does not induce clinical responses, CXCR5(+) PD-1(+) CD8 T cells show loss of the memory phenotype and increased effector differentiation. In conclusion, we identified CXCR5(+) PD-1(+) CD8 T cells in human peripheral blood and LN, which could play a similar role during PD-1 ICB. Future studies should analyze CXCR5(+) PD-1(+) CD8 T cells during PD-1 ICB and their importance for therapeutic response.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that is easily transmitted from human to human through the respiratory route. Usually, it presents with fever, headache, fatigue accompanied by respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea, and other systemic involvements. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoproliferative neoplasm characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and demonstration of clonality unlike other causes of lymphocytosis. Patients with CLL are considered immunocompromised because of impaired humoral immunity (mainly) and cellular immunity. Therefore, they are vulnerable to various infections including COVID-19. Little is known about the COVID-19 infection when it unmasks CLL. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man with no significant previous illnesses, and an unremarkable family history, presented with a moderate COVID-19 infection. He initially presented to the emergency department with fever and mild shortness of breath. A complete blood count showed a high white blood cell count with absolute lymphocytosis. Flow cytometry revealed the clonality of the lymphocytes confirming the diagnosis of CLL. Despite having CLL, he developed a moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered in a few days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CLL, which presented with a COVID-19 infection as the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS Lymphocytosis is an unexpected finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and the elevated lymphocytes may be indicative of other conditions. Secondary causes of lymphocytosis like malignancy or other infections should be considered in these cases.",,"['Ali, Elrazi', 'Badawi, Mohamed', 'Abdelmahmuod, Elabbass', 'Kohla, Samah', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Ali E', 'Badawi M', 'Abdelmahmuod E', 'Kohla S', 'Yassin MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Infectious Disease Department, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematology Division, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['*Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pandemics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology', 'SARS-CoV-2']",PMC7592339,,2020/10/25 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/10/24 17:05'],"['2020/10/24 17:05 [entrez]', '2020/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['926062 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.926062 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Oct 24;21:e926062. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.926062.,e926062,,20201024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, other therapeutic approaches are needed to treat those patients. In the present study, we report that the metal chelator TPEN affected DeltaPsim and DNA content in isolated CD34(+) refractory cells from bone marrow ALL (n = 7; B-cell, n = 4; T-cell, n = 3) and AML (n = 3) pediatric patients. Furthermore, TPEN induced oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor protein DJ-1, induced up-regulation of BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein PUMA, transcription factor p53 and activated the executor protease CASPASE-3 as apoptosis markers, and reduced the reactivity of the cellular proliferating marker Ki-67 in all acute leukemic groups, and reduced the phosphorylation of c-ABL protein signal in an AML case. Remarkably, bone marrow cells from non-leukemic patients' cells (n = 2) displayed neither loss of DeltaPsim nor loss of DNA content when exposed to TPEN. We conclude that TPEN selectively induces apoptosis in acute leukemic cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling mechanism.

Testicular cells (TCs) secrete a variety of growth factors such as growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), stem cell factor (SCF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and other, that could improve oocyte maturation. Here we have investigated the effect of human TCCM (hTCCM) on in vitro maturation (IVM) and morphology of mouse oocytes. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 360 germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were obtained from NMRI mice, aged 4-6 weeks that had received 5 IU pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) 48 hours before. GV oocytes were subjected to IVM. 120 GV oocytes were cultured in each medium; hTCCM as the test group, DMEM + 20%FBS as the control group and Ham's F10 + HFF medium as the sham group. The rates of the IVM and perivitelline space (PVS) changes were recorded at 8, 16 and 24 hours after culture. The metaphase II (MII) oocytes were subjected for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the fertilization rate was evaluated after 1, 2, and 3 days. Results: There was a significant difference between the maturation rates in hTCCM (31.67% MII) and the control [0% MII, P<0.05, (7.5% MI, 52.5% deg. and 40%GV)] groups but there was not a significant difference between the maturation rates in hTCCM and the sham group (53.33% MII, P>0.05). IVF success rate for MII oocytes obtained from IVM in the hTCCM group was 28.94% (n=11). Our data showed that hTCCM is an effective medium for GV oocyte growth and maturation compared to the control medium.

Disease relapse is facilitated by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that are resistant to standard chemotherapy and promote tumor growth. To target AML blasts and LSCs using natural killer (NK) cells, we have developed a trispecific killer engager (TriKE(TM)) molecule containing a humanized anti-CD16 heavy chain camelid single-domain antibody (sdAb) that activates NK cells, an IL-15 molecule that drives NK-cell priming, expansion and survival, and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against human CLEC12A (CLEC12A TriKE). CLEC12A is a myeloid lineage antigen that is highly expressed by AML cells and LSCs, but not expressed by normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), thus minimizing off-target toxicity. The CLEC12A TriKE induced robust NK-cell specific proliferation, enhanced NK-cell activation, and killing of both AML cell lines and primary patient-derived AML blasts in vitro while sparing healthy HSCs. Additionally, the CLEC12A TriKE was able to reduce tumor burden in preclinical mouse models.

Such effects could be inhibited by treatment with an ERK1/2 inhibitor, ERK1/2-specific siRNA, or cirmtuzumab, an anti-ROR1 mAb. The CLL-derived line, MEC1, expresses Wnt5a, but not ROR1. MEC1 cells transfected to express ROR1 (MEC1-ROR1) had higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 than parental MEC1, or MEC1 transfected with ROR1DeltaPRD, a truncated ROR1 lacking the cytoplasmic proline-rich domain (PRD), or ROR1(P808A) a mutant ROR1 with a P-->A substitution at 808, which is required for complexing with the Rac-specific-guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor DOCK2 upon stimulation with Wnt5a. We silenced DOCK2 with siRNA and found this repressed the capacity of Wnt5a to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MEC1-ROR1 or CLL cells. CLL cells that expressed ROR1 had higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 or DOCK2 than CLL cells lacking ROR1. Although we found ibrutinib could inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and DOCK2 induced by B-cell-receptor ligation, we found that this drug was unable to inhibit Wnt5a-induced, ROR1-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or DOCK2.

Three proteins (kappa-casein, timothy grass pollen extract, polyclonal anti-human IgE) were printed onto three different polymer-coated surfaces (aldehyde-, epoxy- and NHS ester-coated). ToF-SIMs analysis was performed to assess printed protein stability and retention during washing steps.

To facilitate treatment decisions, the ""fitness criteria"" proposed by Ferrara et al. (Leukemia, 2013), including age > 75 years, performance status and comorbidities, were verified retrospectively in 699 patients with AML (419 de-novo, 280 secondary AML), diagnosed at 8 Hematological Centers (REL). METHODS: Patients were categorized in FIT to intensive chemotherapy (i-T) (292, 42.5%), UNFIT to i-T (289, 42.1%), or unfit even to non-intensive therapy (non i-T) (FRAIL) (105, 15.3%). Biological characteristics and treatment actually received by patients [i-T, 274 patients (39.2%); non i-T, 134 (19.2%), best-supportive care (BSC), 291 (41.6%)] were recorded. RESULTS: ""Fitness criteria"" were easily applicable in 98.1% of patients. Overall concordance between ""fitness criteria"" and treatment actually received by patients was high (79.4%), 76% in FIT, 82.7% in UNFIT and 80% in FRAIL patients. Fitness independently predicted survival (median survival: 10.9, 4.2 and 1.8 months in FIT, UNFIT and FRAIL patients, respectively; p = 0.000), as confirmed also by multivariate analysis. In FRAIL patients, survival with any treatment was no better than with BSC, in UNFIT non i-T was as effective as i-T and better than BSC, and in FIT patients i-T was better than non i-T or BSC. In addition, a non-adverse risk AML, an ECOG PS <2, and receiving any treatment other than BSC had a favorable effect on survival (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These simple ""fitness criteria"" applied at the time of diagnosis could facilitate, together with AML biologic risk evaluation, the choice of the most appropriate treatment intensity in older AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This prompted the development of techniques for cloning the variable regions of conventional murine antibodies, genetically mounted on human IgG. The last step in this years-long process was the design for the preparation of fully human reagents. The choice of the target molecule was also problematic, since cancer-specific targets are quite limited in number. To overcome this obstacle in the planning phases of antibody-mediated therapy, attention was focused on a set of normal molecules, whose quantitative distribution may balance a tissue-dependent generalized expression. The results and clinical success obtained with anti-CD20 mAbs revived interest in this type of strategy. Using multiple myeloma (MM) as a tumor model was challenging first of all because the plasma cells and their neoplastic counterpart eluded the efforts of the Workshop on Differentiation Antigens to find a target molecule exclusively expressed by these cells. For this reason, attention was turned to surface molecules which fulfill the requisites of being reasonably good targets, even if not specifically restricted to tumor cells. In 2009, we proposed CD38 as a MM target in virtue of its expression: it is absent on early hematological progenitors, has variable but generalized limited expression by normal cells, but is extremely high in plasma cells and in myeloma. Further, regulation of its expression appeared to be dependent on a variety of factors, including exposure to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells that are now approved for in vivo use. This review discusses the history of human CD38, from its initial characterization to its targeting in antibody-mediated therapy of human myeloma.",,"['Horenstein, Alberto L', 'Faini, Angelo C', 'Morandi, Fabio', 'Bracci, Cristiano', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Giuliani, Nicola', 'Paulus, Aneel', 'Malavasi, Fabio']","['Horenstein AL', 'Faini AC', 'Morandi F', 'Bracci C', 'Lanza F', 'Giuliani N', 'Paulus A', 'Malavasi F']","['Dipartimento Scienze Mediche, Universita di Torino, Centro Ricerche Medicina Sperimentale (CeRMS) and Fondazione Ricerca Molinette Onlus, 10121 Torino, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Mediche, Universita di Torino, Centro Ricerche Medicina Sperimentale (CeRMS) and Fondazione Ricerca Molinette Onlus, 10121 Torino, Italy.', 'U.O.C.

In contrast to ATP-competitive BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors employed to treat CML that target multiple kinases, asciminib binds to the myristate binding pocket on the kinase domains of ABL1 and BCR-ABL1. Hitherto no drugs have been developed whose mechanism of action involves interacting with myristate binding pockets on proteins, and analysis of the structures of such binding sites in proteins other than ABL1/ABL2/BCR-ABL1 strongly suggest that asciminib will not bind to these with high affinity. Accordingly, the drug has no known safety liabilities resulting from any off-target activity, as illustrated by its specificity towards cells expressing BCR-ABL1 and lack of effects on non-kinase targets in biochemical screens. Because asciminib does not bind to the ATP-binding site it maintains substantial activity against kinase domain mutations that impart acquired drug resistance to ATP-competitive drugs. However, in vitro studies in cells have identified BCR-ABL1 mutations that reduce the anti-proliferative activity of asciminib, some of which are associated with clinical resistance towards the drug in patients. Here we review effects of asciminib on mutant forms of BCR-ABL1, analyse their sensitivity towards the drug from a structural perspective and affirm support for employing combinations with ATP-competitive inhibitors to impede the reactivation of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in patients receiving monotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Pre-clinical models such as ex vivo cultures are extensively used towards the development of novel drugs and to study synergistic drug combinations, as well as to discover biomarkers for both drug response and anti-cancer drug resistance. Although these approaches empower efficient investigation of multiple drugs in a multitude of primary AML samples, their translational value and reproducibility are hampered by the lack of standardized methodologies and by culture system-specific behavior of AML cells and chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, distinct research questions require specific methods which rely on specific technical knowledge and skills. To address these aspects, we herein review commonly used culture techniques in light of diverse research questions. In addition, culture-dependent effects on drug resistance towards commonly used drugs in the treatment of AML are summarized including several pitfalls that may arise because of culture technique artifacts.

As yet there are no reports of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Haemovigilance findings within a three-month surveillance period during the new coronavirus pandemic are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to great demand and shortage, blood sessions in outpatient facilities were organized during the high prevalence period of COVID-19, alongside a national plan to monitor the evolving public health situation by random molecular screening of high-risk groups of the population. Haemovigilance protocols were implemented as well as surveillance for any COVID-19 case reported post-transfusion. A 14-day quarantine and follow-up molecular and antibody testing of any COVID-19 positive case was obligatory. RESULTS: Post-donation, post-transfusion information and molecular testing of swab samples collected from three asymptomatic donors at risk for COVID-19, revealed the case of an immunosupressed patient who had been transfused with whole blood derived platelets from a donor subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The recipient exhibited no symptoms of the disease. Molecular and antibody testing results were negative. CONCLUSION: Haemovigilance provided information supporting the absence of transfusion transmission of COVID-19, thus strengthening the hypothesis that, even if it cannot yet be definitively ruled out, COVID-19 is not transmitted through blood transfusion. As of early June 2020, a perfect test does not exist, therefore haemovigilance along with the implementation of strict proactive measures is crucial to identify eluding asymptomatic individuals and ensure blood safety during the pandemic.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine (SFTS).

However, the groundbreaking success with aminopterin in the treatment of patients with pediatric acute leukemia and methotrexate in the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma established single-agent chemotherapy as a pioneering contribution to oncology. The landmark discovery that early-stage Hodgkin disease is curable with radiation made radiotherapy into an essential specialty of oncology. Although radical surgical treatment dominated the field of surgery, the excision of localized cancers with or without adjuvant radiation emerged as new modality in therapy. Cytopathology and surgical pathology became new fields in medicine and pathologists became an integral part of the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care of patients with cancer. The discovery of multiple new drugs demonstrated promising results and widened the field of oncology from the laboratory to the clinic. In the etiology of cancer, precancerous conditions were named and carcinoma of the lung was definitively linked to cigarette smoking. All things considered, the progress made between 1942 and 1962 came about through the dedicated work of many individuals. However, there were 7 distinguished pathfinders (2 pathologists, 1 pediatric pathologist-oncologist, 1 radiation therapist, 1 physician-actuary, 1 gynecologist-oncologist, and 1 chemist) who, despite their different backgrounds, interests, and sex, made groundbreaking contributions to oncology.",['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],"['Hajdu, Steven I']",['Hajdu SI'],"['Pathology Consultants, Westlake Village, California.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Drug Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mammography/*methods', 'Medical Oncology/*methods']",,,2020/10/24 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/10/23 17:10'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/23 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33223 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Jan 1;127(1):12-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33223.

However, their effects on clinical outcomes have not been fully investigated. To address this, we comprehensively examined genetic alterations and their prognostic impact in a large series of pediatric B-ALL cases. We performed targeted capture sequencing in a total of 1003 pediatric patients with B-ALL from 2 Japanese cohorts. Transcriptome sequencing (n = 116) and/or array-based gene expression analysis (n = 120) were also performed in 203 (84%) of 243 patients who were not categorized into any disease subgroup by panel sequencing or routine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for major fusions in B-ALL. Our panel sequencing identified novel recurrent mutations in 2 genes (CCND3 and CIC), and both had positive correlations with ETV6-RUNX1 and hypodiploid ALL, respectively. In addition, positive correlations were also newly reported between TCF3-PBX1 ALL with PHF6 mutations. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models for overall survival, TP53 mutation/deletion, hypodiploid, and MEF2D fusions were selected in both cohorts. For TP53 mutations, the negative effect on overall survival was confirmed in an independent external cohort (n = 466). TP53 mutation was frequently found in IGH-DUX4 (5 of 57 [9%]) ALL, with 4 cases having 17p LOH and negatively affecting overall survival therein, whereas TP53 mutation was not associated with poor outcomes among NCI (National Cancer Institute) standard risk (SR) patients. A conventional treatment approach might be enough, and further treatment intensification might not be necessary, for patients with TP53 mutations if they are categorized into NCI SR.",['(c) 2020 by

Pediatric patients with r/r ALL treated with CAR-T are at increased risk of both cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and sepsis. We sought to investigate the biologic differences between CRS and sepsis and to develop predictive models which could accurately differentiate CRS from sepsis at the time of critical illness. We identified 23 different cytokines that were significantly different between patients with sepsis and CRS. Using elastic net prediction modeling and tree classification, we identified cytokines that were able to classify subjects as having CRS or sepsis accurately. A markedly elevated interferon gamma (IFNgamma) or a mildly elevated IFNgamma in combination with a low IL1beta were associated with CRS. A normal to mildly elevated IFNgamma in combination with an elevated IL1beta was associated with sepsis. This combination of IFNgamma and IL1beta was able to categorize subjects as having CRS or sepsis with 97% accuracy.

METHODS: This chart review study (NCT02559583; 2008-2015)evaluated time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) outcomes among patients with CLL who initiate done (n = 261) to two (n = 96) lines of therapy (LOT) since diagnosis. Differences in TTP and OS were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, with a log-rank test for statistical significance. Association between therapeutic regimen and risk for disease progression or death was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: The most commonly prescribed therapies in both LOTs were chlorambucil-, followed by fludarabine- and cyclophosphamide (C)/CHOP-based therapies. Chlorambucil- and C/CHOP-based therapies were largely prescribed to elderly patients (>/=65 years) while fludarabine-based therapy was predominantly used by younger patients (</=65 years). In LOT1, relative to chlorambucil-administered patients, those prescribed fludarabine-based therapies had lower risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 [0.19-0.54]), whereas C/CHOP-prescribed patients had higher risk (HR 95%CI 1.88 [1.17-3.04]). Similar results were observed in LOT2. There was no difference in OS between treatments in both LOTs. DISCUSSION: Novel therapies such as kinase inhibitors were rarely prescribed in LOT1 or LOT2in Latin America. The greater TTP observed forfludarabine-based therapies could be attributed to the fact that fludarabine-based therapies are predominantly administered to young and healthy patients. CONCLUSION: Chlorambucil-based therapy, which has limited benefits, is frequently prescribed in Latin America. Prescribing novel agents for fludarabine-based therapy-ineligible patients with CLL is the need of the hour.

However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that influence key factors in lymphocyte biology such as NOTCH, PAX5, MYC and EZH2. LncRNAs were described to modulate lymphocyte activation by regulating pathways such as NFAT, NFkappaB, MYC, interferon and TCR/BCR signalling (NRON, NKILA, BCALM, GAS5, PVT1), and cell effector functions (IFNG-AS1, TH2-LCR).

We sought to evaluate whether radiation therapy (RT) after lumpectomy was associated with equivalent survival among men > 70 years of age with stage I, estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors, as seen in women from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 trial. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 752 stage I, ER-positive male breast cancer patients >/= 70 years who were treated with hormone therapy and surgery, with or without RT, from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2014. Patients were categorized based on surgery and RT (lumpectomy alone, lumpectomy with RT, and mastectomy alone). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to compare overall survival between treatment groups. RESULTS: Most patients underwent total mastectomy, with only 32.6% treated with lumpectomy. Of those who underwent lumpectomy, 72.7% received adjuvant RT. In multivariate analysis, there was no statistical difference in overall survival when comparing lumpectomy alone and lumpectomy with RT (aHR 0.72 [95% CI 0.38-1.37], p = 0.31) or when comparing lumpectomy (alone or with RT) and mastectomy (aHR 1.28 [95% CI 0.88-1.87], p = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this national sample of elderly men with ER-positive early-stage disease treated with endocrine therapy, there were no significant differences in overall survival when comparing lumpectomy alone and lumpectomy with RT, or lumpectomy (alone or with RT) and mastectomy.

In contrast, long-term control of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cannot be achieved by single lineage-specific targeting while sparing benign hematopoiesis. In addition, heterogeneity of AML warrants combinatorial targeting, and several suitable immunotargets (HAVCR2/CD33 and HAVCR2/CLEC12A) have been identified in adult AML. However, clinical and biologic characteristics of AML differ between children and the elderly. Here, we analyzed 36 bone marrow (BM) samples of pediatric AML patients and 13 age-matched healthy donors using whole RNA sequencing of sorted CD45dim and CD34+CD38-CD45dim BM populations and flow cytometry for surface expression of putative target antigens. Pediatric AML clusters apart from healthy myeloid BM precursors in principal-component analysis. Known immunotargets of adult AML, such as IL3RA, were not overexpressed in pediatric AML compared with healthy precursors by RNA sequencing. CD33 and CLEC12A were the most upregulated immunotargets on the RNA level and showed the highest surface expression on AML detected by flow cytometry. KMT2A-mutated infant AML clusters separately by RNA sequencing and overexpresses FLT3, and hence, CD33/FLT3 cotargeting is an additional specific option for this subgroup. CLEC12A and CD33/CLEC12Adouble-positive expression was absent in CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and nonhematopoietic tissue, while CD33 and FLT3 are expressed on HSCs. In summary, we show that expression of immunotargets in pediatric AML differs from known expression profiles in adult AML. We identify CLEC12A and CD33 as preferential generic combinatorial immunotargets in pediatric AML and CD33 and FLT3 as immunotargets specific for KMT2A-mutated infant AML.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Willier, Semjon', 'Rothamel, Paula', 'Hastreiter, Maximilian', 'Wilhelm, Jonas', 'Stenger, Dana', 'Blaeschke, Franziska', 'Rohlfs, Meino', 'Kaeuferle, Theresa', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Binder, Vera', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Klein, Christoph', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias']","['Willier S', 'Rothamel P', 'Hastreiter M', 'Wilhelm J', 'Stenger D', 'Blaeschke F', 'Rohlfs M', 'Kaeuferle T', 'Schmid I', 'Albert MH', 'Binder V', 'Subklewe M', 'Klein C', 'Feuchtinger T']","[""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", 'Gene Center, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Munich, Germany.', ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and."", 'Gene Center, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Munich, Germany.', ""Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, and.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*genetics/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*genetics/immunology', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2020/10/24 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2020/10/23 05:59'],"['2020/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/23 05:59 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00383-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020006921 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Feb 25;137(8):1037-1049. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020006921.,1037-1049,,,,,,,['Blood. 2021 Feb 25;137(8):1004-1006.

Three distinct clinical forms of BL are recognized: endemic (African), sporadic (non-endemic), and immunodeficiency-associated. Bilateral renal infiltration leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rare initial presentation of BL. Diagnosis is usually made after evaluating the histology and immunophenotyping of the affected tissue. We report a case of a 46-year-old male who presented with symptoms of AKI resulting from infiltrative disease, a primary presentation of lymphoma. The patient was a known case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for the last five years and was referred to the nephrology department due to acute elevation in creatinine, from 0.8 mg/dL to 3.57 mg/dL. On physical examination, there was no lymphadenopathy. Nephrology and SLE workup revealed low complement protein levels and absolute neutrophils, lymphocytes, and metamyelocytes. Renal ultrasound (USG) showed both kidneys with symmetric and edematous appearance. Biopsy affirmed high-grade B-cell lymphoma, positive for BCL-6 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma) and CD-10 (cell surface marker) and negative for BCL-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma). PET (positron emission tomography) scan showed extensive hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy in multiple areas. The patient was started on chemotherapy and on continuous renal replacement therapy. He improved clinically, and his creatinine lowered down to 0.8 mg/dL. Repeat USG showed decreased edematous appearance of both kidneys. Primary renal infiltration by BL is a rare presentation in adults. Prompt renal biopsy will change the course of treatment and can affect the prognosis.

However, the drug has little effect on the underlying bone marrow fibrosis or on mutant allele burden, and clinical resistance eventually develops. Furthermore, ruxolitinib-induced cytopenias can be challenging in everyday practice. Areas covered: The developmental therapeutics landscape in MF is discussed. This includes potential partners for ruxolitinib being developed with an aim to improve cytopenias, or to enhance its disease-modifying effects. The development of other JAK inhibitors with efficacy post-ruxolitinib or other unique attributes is being pursued in earnest. Agents with novel mechanisms of action are being studied in patients whose disease responds sub-optimally to, is refractory to or progresses after ruxolitinib. Expert opinion: The JAK inhibitors fedratinib, pacritinib and momelotinib are clearly active, and it is expected that one or more of these will become licensed in the future. The activin receptor ligand traps are promising as treatments for anemia. Imetelstat has shown interesting activity post-ruxolitinib, and azactidine may be a useful partner for ruxolitinib in some patients.

Targeting ABCG2 is a potential strategy for selective therapy and eradicate MDR cells, thus improving malignant leukemia treatment. KD025 (SLx-2119) is a novel Rho-associated protein kinase 2-selective inhibitor, which has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis in human adipose-derived stem cells and restore impaired immune homeostasis in autoimmunity therapy. The present study demonstrated that KD025 improved the efficacy of antineoplastic drugs in ABCG2-overexpressing leukemia cells and primary leukemia blast cells derived from patients with leukemia. Moreover, KD025 significantly inhibited the efflux of [(3)H]-mitoxantrone and hence accumulated higher levels of [(3)H]-mitoxantrone in HL60/ABCG2 cells. However, mechanistic research indicated that KD025 did not alter the protein levels and subcellular locations of ABCG2. KD025 may restrain the efflux activity of ABCG2 by obstructing ATPase activity. Taken together, KD025 can sensitize conventional antineoplastic drugs in ABCG2-overexpressing leukemia cells by blocking the pump function of ABCG2 protein. The present findings may provide a novel and useful combinational therapeutic strategy of KD025 and antineoplastic drugs for leukemia patients with ABCG2-mediated MDR.",['Copyright: (c) Jing et al.'],"['Jing, Wen', 'Zhang, Xuerong', 'Chen, Ruixia', 'Ye, Xijiu', 'Zhou, Mao', 'Li, Weixing', 'Yan, Wenchan', 'Xuyun, Xiuxiu', 'Peng, Jun']","['Jing W', 'Zhang X', 'Chen R', 'Ye X', 'Zhou M', 'Li W', 'Yan W', 'Xuyun X', 'Peng J']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510220, P.R.

However, their expression patterns and function in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and function of circadian clock gene Period2 (Per2) in human CML. Per2 expression levels in neutrophils isolated from patients with CML and healthy donors were measured via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Subsequently, through lentivirus transduction, Per2 was stably overexpressed in human CML cell line KCL22 cells, which were injected into nude mice to investigate the in vivo role of Per2 by measuring CML tumor size and weight. Additionally, Per2 expression levels in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were analyzed by re-analyzing microarray data in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Per2 expression was significantly lower in neutrophils isolated from patients with CML patients compared with healthy donors, and was negatively correlated with the expression level of c-Myc. Similarly, patients with AML or CLL displayed lower Per2 expression levels compared with healthy controls. Per2 overexpression inhibited KCL22 cell proliferation in nude mice and in vitro, and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. By contrast, the results also indicated that KCL22 cell apoptosis was not regulated by Per2. The present study identified Per2 as a potential tumor suppressor in human CML.",['Copyright: (c) Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Na', 'Mi, Miaomiao', 'Wei, Xiaonan', 'Sun, Chengming']","['Wang N', 'Mi M', 'Wei X', 'Sun C']","['Department of Laboratory Center, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, Shandong 264000, P.R.

Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase lipid kinase family that controls the canonical autophagy pathway and vesicular trafficking. Using a recently developed specific inhibitor (VPS34-IN1), we found that VPS34 inhibition induces apoptosis in AML cells but not in normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Complete and acute inhibition of VPS34 was required for the antileukemic activity of VPS34-IN1. This inhibitor also has pleiotropic effects against various cellular functions related to class III PI3K in AML cells that may explain their survival impairment. VPS34-IN1 inhibits basal and L-asparaginase-induced autophagy in AML cells. A synergistic cell death activity of this drug was also demonstrated. VPS34-IN1 was additionally found to impair vesicular trafficking and mTORC1 signaling. From an unbiased approach based on phosphoproteomic analysis, we identified that VPS34-IN1 specifically inhibits STAT5 phosphorylation downstream of FLT3-ITD signaling in AML.

Previous studies identified B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11b (BCL11B) as a novel tumor suppressor with impressive capacity to restrain CSC traits. However, the implications of BCL11B in HCC remain unclear. In this study, we found that low BCL11B expression was an independent indicator for shorter overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) for HCC patients with surgical resection. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed BCL11B as a tumor suppressor in HCC with inhibitory effects on proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and mobility. Furthermore, BCL11B could suppress CSC traits, as evidenced by dramatically decreased tumor spheroid formation, self-renewal potential and drug resistance. A Cignal Finder Array and dual-luciferase activity reporter assays revealed that BCL11B could activate the transcription of P73 via an E2F1-dependent manner. Thus, we concluded that BCL11B is a strong suppressor of retaining CSC traits in HCC. Ectopic expression of BCL11B might be a promising strategy for anti-HCC treatment with the potential to cure HBV-related HCC regardless of P53 mutation status.",,"['Yang, Wen-Jing', 'Sun, Yun-Fan', 'Jin, An-Li', 'Lv, Li-Hua', 'Zhu, Jie', 'Wang, Bei-Li', 'Zhou, Yan', 'Zhang, Chun-Yan', 'Wang, Hao', 'Hu, Bo', 'Wang, Peng-Xiang', 'Te, Liu', 'Pan, Bai-Shen', 'Zhou, Jian', 'Fan, Jia', 'Yang, Xin-Rong', 'Guo, Wei']","['Yang WJ', 'Sun YF', 'Jin AL', 'Lv LH', 'Zhu J', 'Wang BL', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang CY', 'Wang H', 'Hu B', 'Wang PX', 'Te L', 'Pan BS', 'Zhou J', 'Fan J', 'Yang XR', 'Guo W']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Liver Surgery & Transplantation, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University; Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, 200032, Shanghai, P.

Recent research has demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) of some Bcl-2 protein family members can modulate apoptosis; however, the transmembrane interactome of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the Mcl-1 TMD forms homooligomers in the mitochondrial membrane, competes with full-length Mcl-1 protein with regards to its antiapoptotic function, and induces cell death in a Bok-dependent manner. While the Bok TMD oligomers locate preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), heterooligomerization between the TMDs of Mcl-1 and Bok predominantly takes place at the mitochondrial membrane.

However, a considerable proportion of patients with skin cancer is immuno-compromised by concomitant diseases. Due to their previous exclusion from clinical trials, the ICI treatment efficacy is poorly investigated in these patients. The present study analyzed the ICI treatment outcome in advanced patients with skin cancer with a concomitant hematological malignancy. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included patients who were treated with ICI for locally advanced or metastatic melanoma (MM), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), or Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), and had a previous diagnosis of a hematological malignancy irrespective of disease activity or need of therapy at ICI treatment start. Comparator patient cohorts without concomitant hematological malignancy were extracted from the prospective multicenter skin cancer registry ADOREG. Treatment outcome was measured as best overall response, progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 84 patients (MM, n=52; cSCC, n=15; MCC, n=17) with concomitant hematological malignancy were identified at 20 skin cancer centers. The most frequent concomitant hematological malignancies were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=70), with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=32) being the largest entity. While 9 patients received ICI in an adjuvant setting, 75 patients were treated for advanced non-resectable disease (55 anti-PD-1; 8 anti-PD-L1; 5 anti-CTLA-4; 7 combinations). In the latter 75 patients, best objective response (complete response+partial response) was 28.0%, disease stabilization was 25.3%, and 38.6% showed progressive disease (PD). Subdivided by skin cancer entity, best objective response was 31.1% (MM), 26.7% (cSCC), and 18.8% (MCC). Median PFS was 8.4 months (MM), 4.0 months (cSCC), and 5.7 months (MCC). 1-year OS rates were 78.4% (MM), 65.8% (cSCC), and 47.4% (MCC). Comparison with respective ADOREG patient cohorts without hematological malignancy (n=392) revealed no relevant differences in ICI therapy outcome for MM and MCC, but a significantly reduced PFS for cSCC (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: ICI therapy showed efficacy in advanced patients with skin cancer with a concomitant hematological malignancy. Compared with patients without hematological malignancy, the observed ICI therapy outcome was impaired in cSCC, but not in MM or MCC patients.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Though oesophageal mucormycosis is relatively rare, it remains an elusive and devastating manifestation of this disease. The management is also challenging, due to surgical morbidity and contraindications such as thrombocytopenia in immunocompromised hosts. In this report, we present the case of a 60-year-old Lebanese man with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia who developed oesophageal mucormycosis after induction chemotherapy with idarubicin/cytarabine (7+3). The diagnosis was made when the patient developed febrile neutropenia and odynophagia. CT scan of the chest revealed a thickened oesophagus. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, histopathology and PCR were performed, resulting in the diagnosis of Rhizopus microsporus The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and salvage posaconazole therapy without surgical intervention. We reviewed the clinical characteristics of the six published oesophageal mucormycosis reports from the literature.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020. No commercial re-use.

In this review we focus on the recent development of indoor air pollution mitigation materials based on adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition. First, we review on the primary indoor air pollutants including formaldehyde, benzene compounds, PM2.5, flame retardants, and plasticizer: Next, the recent advances in the use of adsorption materials including traditional biochar and MOF (metal-organic frameworks) as the new emerging porous materials for VOCs absorption is reviewed. We review the mechanism for mitigation of VOCs using biochar (noncarbonized organic matter partition and adsorption) and MOF together with parameters that affect indoor air pollution removal efficiency based on current mitigation approaches including the mitigation of VOCs using photocatalytic oxidation.

No information is available concerning the presence of feline hemoplasma infections in cats in Romania. Thus, the objective of the present study was to provide data on the occurrence and molecular characterization of hemotropic mycoplasmas in client-owned cats in Romania. METHODS: Blood samples from 51 unhealthy cats, originating from Timisoara Municipality, Romania, were screened for the presence of hemoplasmas using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene and sequencing assays. PCR-positive samples were subsequently analyzed by phylogenetic and population genetic analysis. RESULTS: Molecular analysis revealed 11 (21.6%) positive samples, consisting of 8 (72.7%) Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum and 3 (27.3%) Mycoplasma haemofelis confirmed positives. Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis was not detected, and no co-infections were registered. No significant associations (p > 0.05) were found between the hemoplasma infection status and age, gender, breed, presence of ectoparasites, feline leukemia virus/feline immunodeficiency virus positivity of cats, or the sampling season. However, outdoor access was positively associated (p = 0.049) with infection and could be considered a risk factor (OR = 4.1) in acquiring feline hemotropic mycoplasmas. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that our sequences clustered with those selected from the GenBank database in two distinct clades.

This paper explores the effect of different genotypes of the env gene of the cattle leukemia virus on hematological parameters of infected animals. The researchers focused on exploring the polymorphism of the env gene and, in doing so, discovered the new genotypes Ia and Ib, which differ from genotype I. Several hypotheses on the origin of the different genotypes in Siberia are discussed. RESULTS: We obtained varying length of the restriction fragments for genotypes I. Additionally using restrictase Hae III were received fragments was named genotype Ia, and genotype Ib. There are 2.57 +/- 0.55% (20 out of 779) samples of genotype Ib which does not differ significantly from 1% (chi(2) = 2.46). Other genotypes were observed in the cattle of Siberia as wild type genotypes (their frequency varied from 17.84 to 32.73%). The maximum viral load was observed in animals with the II and IV viral genotypes (1000-1400 viral particles per 1000 healthy cells), and the minimum viral load was observed animals with genotype Ib (from 700 to 900 viral particles per 1000 healthy cells). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of the direct introduction of genotype II from South America to Siberia is extremely small and it is more likely that the strain originated independently in an autonomous population with its distribution also occurring independently. A new variety of genotype I (Ib) was found, which can be both a neoplasm and a relict strain.",,"['Blazhko, Natalia', 'Vyshegurov, Sultan', 'Donchenko, Alexander', 'Shatokhin, Kirill', 'Ryabinina, Valeria', 'Plotnikov, Kirill', 'Khodakova, Alevtina', 'Pashkovskiy, Sergey']","['Blazhko N', 'Vyshegurov S', 'Donchenko A', 'Shatokhin K', 'Ryabinina V', 'Plotnikov K', 'Khodakova A', 'Pashkovskiy S']","['Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Leukemia, Institute of experimental veterinary medicine, Siberia and the Far East, Siberian Federal Research Centre for Agrobiotechnology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Krasnoobsk, Novosibirsk region, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia. true_genetic@mail.ru.', 'Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Enzyme Analysis and DNA Technologies, Novosibirsk State Agricultural University, Novosibirsk, Russia.']",['eng'],"['capital A, Cyrilliccapital A, Cyrilliccapital A, Cyrilliccapital A,', 'Cyrillic-capital A, Cyrillic20-120012290079-3/Ministry of agriculture of Russian', 'Federation/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genet,BMC genetics,100966978,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle/*virology', '*Genes, env', '*Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Siberia']",PMC7586112,,2020/10/24 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/10/23 05:31'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/23 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12863-020-00874-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12863-020-00874-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genet. 2020 Oct 22;21(Suppl 1):70. doi: 10.1186/s12863-020-00874-y.,70,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9414-2186', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4180-1643', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0000-0716', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0885-2772', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5800-208X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9049-9156', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9387-5601', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4215-7279']",20201022,['NOTNLM'],"['*Agriculture', '*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Cattle', '*Env gene', '*Genotypes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aimed to develop and validate a simple and robust assay with a small volume of plasma based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to determine the concentration of dasatinib and to investigate the impact of the cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors, including ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole, on the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib in rats. METHODS: Thirty rats were divided randomly into five groups, control group (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium), ketoconazole (30 mg/kg) group, voriconazole group (30 mg/kg), itraconazole group (30 mg/kg) and posaconazole group (30 mg/kg). After 150 muL blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 h and precipitated with acetonitrile, the plasma concentration of dasatinib was determined through Fluoro- Phenyl column (150 mmx2.1 mm, 3 mum) in a positive ionization mode. RESULTS: The results suggested that ketoconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole could increase the AUC0-t of dasatinib to varying degrees while significantly reducing its clearance. However, there was no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib, co-administered with itraconazole except for the CL and MRT0-t of dasatinib. Additionally, voriconazole could significantly increase Cmax of dasatinib by approximately 4.12 fold. CONCLUSION: These data indicated that ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole should be cautiously co-administered with dasatinib or close therapeutic drug monitoring of dasatinib concentration, which might cause the drug-drug interaction.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Luo, Xingxian', 'Xue, Xuecai', 'Li, Taifeng', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Huang, Lin', 'Cheng, Gang']","['Luo X', 'Xue X', 'Li T', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang L', 'Cheng G']","['School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', 'School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cyp3a2 protein, rat)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics', 'Ketoconazole/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Models, Animal', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics', 'Voriconazole/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics']",,,2020/10/24 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/10/23 05:31'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/23 05:31 [entrez]']","['CDM-EPUB-110837 [pii]', '10.2174/1389200221666201022140656 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2020;21(13):1022-1030. doi: 10.2174/1389200221666201022140656.,1022-1030,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dasatinib', 'drug-drug interactions', 'itraconazole', 'ketoconazole', 'posaconazole', 'voriconazole']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to (1) examine the cytotoxic actions of oncocalyxone A on human normal and tumor cell lines and (2) determine mechanistic actions underlying effects upon leukemia cells using cellular and molecular techniques. Antiproliferative studies on cancer cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and human erythrocytes were performed using colorimetric assays. To understand cytotoxicity, assessments were performed with HL-60 leukemia cells (8, 16.5, or 33 microM) after 24 hr incubation using light and fluorescence microscopy, trypan blue, flow cytometry, Comet assay, western blot of caspases and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and effects on topoisomerase I and II. Oncocalyxone A exhibited cytotoxic action upon HL-60 cells and dividing leukocytes, but minimal hemolytic action on erythrocytes. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated reduction of cell viability, loss of membrane integrity, cell shrinking, chromatin condensation, blebbings, externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase activation, PARP cleavage, mitochondrial depolarization, and DNA damage. Pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine 4 mM significantly reduced DNA damage and prevented membrane integrity loss. Oncocalyxone A displayed free radical dependent antileukemic activity via apoptotic pathways and induced DNA damage in HL-60 cells. Oncocalyxone A possesses structural chemical simplicity enabling it to be a cost-effective alternative. These properties justify further improvements to enhance activity and selectivity and the development of pharmaceutical formulations.

Quantitative phase imaging, which maps optical path length delays introduced by the specimen, has been demonstrated to discern cellular phenotypes based on differential morphological attributes. Rapid acquisition capability and the availability of label-free images with high information content have enabled researchers to use machine learning (ML) to reveal latent features. We developed a set of ML classifiers, including convolutional neural networks, to discern healthy B cells from lymphoblasts and classify stages of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we show that the average dry mass and volume of normal B cells are lower than those of cancerous cells and that these morphologic parameters increase further alongside disease progression. We find that the relaxed training requirements of a ML approach are conducive to the classification of cell type, with minimal space, training time, and memory requirements.

Evidences for its mechanisms of action.",S0944-7113(20)30213-0 [pii] 10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153383 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl ester (CADPE) is a natural polyphenolic ester isolated as a minor component from a water extract of the Chinese medicine Zhongjiefeng [Sarcandra glabra (Thunb.) Nakai (Chloranthaceae)] and has previously shown to have activity against solid tumors through the modulation of multiple targets or signal pathways. However, the activity and potential mechanism of CADPE against leukemia cells have not yet been characterized. PURPOSE: To investigate whether and how CADPE kills leukemia cells. METHOD: (1) The activity of CADPE inhibiting the growth of different leukemia cell lines was evaluated by MTT assay; (2) Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by CADPE were determined by flow cytometry with FlowJo software for quantification; (3) The protein levels were analyzed by Western blot and ubiquitin-binding c-Myc was acquired by co-immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: CADPE exerted potent activity against different leukemia cell lines with low toxicity in normal cells. In terms of mechanism of action, CADPE promoted ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Myc through activating glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and downregulating deubiquitinating enzyme USP28 to trigger the interaction of c-Myc with ubiquitin ligase Fbw7, resulting in the downregulation of cell cycle regulators and anti-apoptotic proteins and consequently, cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: CADPE is a novel c-Myc inhibitor with high activity and a unique mechanism for killing leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier GmbH.

We studied the correlations between TdT expression and FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutations in primary AML samples, and the impact on patients' survival. TdT expression was analyzed in 143 adult AML patients by flow cytometry as percentage of positivity and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on blasts. TdT was positive in 49 samples (34.2%), with a median of 48% TdT-positivity (range 7-98) and a median MFI of 2.70 (range 1.23-30.54). FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations were present in 24 (16.7%) and 34 (23.7%) cases, respectively. Median TdT expression on blasts was significantly higher in FLT3-ITD+, as compared with FLT3-ITD- AMLs (median 8% vs 0% respectively, p = 0.035). NPM1 mutational status, FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, karyotype, and ELN risk groups, did not correlate with TdT expression or MFI on blasts. TdT + patients had poorer survival as compared to TdT-, but this result was not confirmed by the multivariable analysis, where ELN risk stratification as well as age and type of treatment remained independent prognostic factors for OS.

Since the establishment of ATO as a frontline therapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the survival of APL patients have been greatly improved and APL is turned from highly fatal to highly curable disease. Mechanistically, ATO can induce PML/RARalpha fusion protein degradation, causing APL cell differentiation and apoptosis. On the other hand, the side effects such as differentiation syndrome, cardiac conduction abnormalities and liver toxicity are often observed during the ATO treatment of APL in clinic. It is likely that the therapeutic and adverse effects of ATO is probably associated with its distinct pattern of metabolism and direct or indirect effects on different organs. In this review, we provided a comprehensive and in-depth elaboration of the cytotoxic mechanisms of ATO and its methylated metabolites based on in vivo or in vitro studies, trying to clarify the importance of achieving balance between the toxicity and anti-leukemic activity of ATO in APL treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Various anti-CD19 CAR T-cell constructs have been trialled and responses vary widely among different studies. We aimed to systematically analyse the outcomes of patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells and identify factors associated with differences in outcomes. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished clinical trials that reported data on the outcomes of adult or paediatric patients that were treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia, reported between Jan 1, 2012, and April 14, 2020. Studies with two patients or fewer were excluded and summary data were extracted from the reports. The primary outcome was the number of patients who had complete remission at any time after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell infusion. This study is not registered in PROSPERO. FINDINGS: From 1160 studies, we identified 40 potentially appropriate studies, 35 (88%) of which met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis (n=953 patients). The pooled complete remission was 80% (95% CI 75.5-84.8) and heterogeneity between studies was moderate (I(2)=56.96%). In the prespecified subgroup analyses, 195 (75% [95% CI 66.9-82.9, I(2)=35.22%]) of 263 patients in adult studies and 242 (81% [72.9-87.2, I(2)=54.45%]) of 346 patients in paediatric studies achieved complete remission, p=0.24. The pooled complete remission did not significantly differ with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell construct type or single-chain variable fragment clone, but was higher with autologous T-cell origin (727 [83%, 78.5-86.5, I(2)=44.34%] of 901 patients), compared with allogeneic T-cell origin (29 [55%, 30.6-79.0, I(2)=62.64%] of 52 patients; p=0.018). 242 (26% [95% CI 18.5-34.1]) of 854 patients developed grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome and 97 (12% [6.6-19.2]) of 532 developed grade 3 or worse neurotoxicity. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission or who had cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity between different anti-CD19 CAR T-cell constructs. The risk of bias was assessed as low in 17 studies and moderate in 18 studies. INTERPRETATION: The high response rates after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy can be used to guide the use of therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Comparison studies are required to further determine differences in efficacy between different anti-CD19 CAR T-cell constructs in the setting of relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

Mogamulizumab-naive patients were enrolled (n = 102), of whom 101 received mogamulizumab-containing treatment (68 acute, 18 lymphoma, 12 chronic, and 3 smoldering subtypes). At enrollment, there was a significant inverse correlation between serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels and percentages of Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tax-CTLs) in the entire lymphocyte population or in the CD8+ T cell subset, but there was not a correlation with cytomegalovirus pp65-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CMV-CTLs). The overall response rate was 65%, and median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 7.4 and 16.0 months, respectively. A higher percentage of Tax-CTLs, but not CMV-CTLs, within the entire lymphocyte population or in the CD8+ T cell subset was significantly associated with longer survival. Multivariate analysis identified the clinical subtype (acute or lymphoma type), a higher sIL-2R level, and a lower percentage of CD2-CD19+ B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as significant independent unfavorable prognostic factors for OS. This indicates that a higher percentage of B cells might reflect some aspect of a favorable immune status leading to a good outcome with mogamulizumab treatment. In conclusion, the MIMOGA study has demonstrated that mogamulizumab exerts clinically meaningful antitumor activity in ATL. The patient's immunological status before mogamulizumab was significantly associated with treatment outcome.

Previously, we reported safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of this approach. We present updated results in 31 patients who received intensive chemotherapy followed by CB infusion and identify predictors of response. To enhance the antileukemic effect, we selected CB units (CBU) with shared inherited paternal antigens and/or noninherited maternal antigens with the recipients. Twenty-eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 2 with myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 in chronic myeloid leukemia myeloid blast crisis were enrolled; 9 had relapsed after allogeneic transplant. Response was defined as <5% blasts in hypocellular bone marrow at 2 weeks after treatment. Thirteen patients (42%) responded; a rate higher than historical data with chemotherapy only. Twelve had CBU-derived chimerism detected; chimerism was a powerful predictor of response (P < .001). CBU lymphocyte content and a prior transplant were associated with chimerism (P < .01). Safety was acceptable: 3 patients developed mild cytokine release syndrome, 2 had grade 1 and 2 had grade 4 graft-versus-host disease. Seven responders and 6 nonresponders (after additional therapy) received subsequent transplant; 5 are alive (follow-up, 5-47 months). The most common cause of death for nonresponders was disease progression, whereas for responders it was infection. CB-derived adoptive cell therapy is feasible and efficacious for refractory AML. Banked CBU are readily available for treatment. Response depends on chimerism, highlighting the graft-versus-leukemia effect of CB cell therapy.

The role of DM-induced hyperglycemic (HG) stress in blood cancer is poorly understood. Epidemiologic studies show that individuals with DM are more likely to have a higher rate of mutations in genes found in pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (pre-LHSPCs) including TET2. TET2-mutant pre-LHSPCs require additional hits to evolve into full-blown leukemia and/or an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Intrinsic mutations have been shown to cooperate with Tet2 to promote leukemic transformation. However, the extrinsic factors are poorly understood. Using a mouse model carrying Tet2 haploinsufficiency to mimic the human pre-LHSPC condition and HG stress, in the form of an Ins2Akita/+ mutation, which induces hyperglycemia and type 1 DM, we show that the compound mutant mice developed a lethal form of MPN and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RNA-Seq revealed that this was due in part to upregulation of proinflammatory pathways, thereby generating a feed-forward loop, including expression of the antiapoptotic, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Morrbid. Loss of Morrbid in the compound mutants rescued the lethality and mitigated MPN/AML. We describe a mouse model for age-dependent MPN/AML and suggest that hyperglycemia acts as an environmental driver for myeloid neoplasms, which could be prevented by reducing expression levels of the inflammation-related lncRNA Morrbid.",,"['Cai, Zhigang', 'Lu, Xiaoyu', 'Zhang, Chi', 'Nelanuthala, Sai', 'Aguilera, Fabiola', 'Hadley, Abigail', 'Ramdas, Baskar', 'Fang, Fang', 'Nephew, Kenneth', 'Kotzin, Jonathan J', 'Williams, Adam', 'Henao-Mejia, Jorge', 'Haneline, Laura', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Cai Z', 'Lu X', 'Zhang C', 'Nelanuthala S', 'Aguilera F', 'Hadley A', 'Ramdas B', 'Fang F', 'Nephew K', 'Kotzin JJ', 'Williams A', 'Henao-Mejia J', 'Haneline L', 'Kapur R']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA173852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL146137/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 HL110854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL140961/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007910/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', '*Haploinsufficiency', '*Heterozygote', '*Hyperglycemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7773407,,2020/10/23 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/10/22 17:33'],"['2020/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/22 17:33 [entrez]']","['140707 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI140707 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1). pii: 140707. doi: 10.1172/JCI140707.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Diabetes', '*Hematology', '*Inflammation', '*Leukemias']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CBT patients, the total RBC count shows dramatic fluctuation due to conditioning before transplantation, including anticancer agents and total body irradiation, as well as RBC transfusions during the treatment period. Therefore, the amount of TAC in whole blood may show wide variation. However, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of TAC has been performed based on the whole blood concentration. In this study, to contribute to TDM of TAC in CBT, we performed the population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis of TAC in 56 CBT patients and investigated the factors that affected the concentration of TAC, focusing the variation of RBC count. METHOD: A one-compartment model was applied to the observed whole blood TAC concentrations, and a PPK analysis was conducted with a non-linear mixed effect model. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our final PPK model indicated good robustness and accuracy. In addition, haemoglobin (Hb) level was an influential covariate on Vd, which was expressed as Vd(L) = 91.4 x (Hb/8.2)((-1.07)) .

Long-lasting TKI treatment, in particular with second-generation TKIs, has enabled clinicians to manage the onset of several side effects and other co-morbidities, such as atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated nine CML patients treated with TKIs between 2017 and 2020 who experienced atrial fibrillation or VTE and received concomitant administration of TKIs and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) outside clinical trials, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years at CML diagnosis (range 52-73 years) and 69 years at the time of starting DOACs. A female predominance was observed. The median follow-up of concomitant DOAC and TKI administration was 8.5 months; edoxaban was administered in six patients and apixaban in two patients, and one patient received rivaroxaban. Regarding CML treatment, four patients received imatinib, two patients bosutinib, and three nilotinib. In eight patients DOACs were started for atrial fibrillation and in one patient for VTE. In none of the patients treated with the combination were additional symptomatic thrombotic adverse events or major bleedings reported. CONCLUSION: In this small case series, the use of DOACs in CML patients seemed feasible. Additional data on long-term outcomes including a larger cohort of CML patients treated with DOACs are, however, needed.",,"['Serrao, Alessandra', 'Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Fiori, Luciano', 'Di Prima, Alessio', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Chistolini, Antonio']","['Serrao A', 'Scalzulli E', 'Fiori L', 'Di Prima A', 'Breccia M', 'Chistolini A']","['Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161, Rome, Italy. antonio.chistolini@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Quinolines', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Venous Thromboembolism']",,,2020/10/23 06:00,2021/01/27 06:00,['2020/10/22 12:18'],"['2020/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/22 12:18 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40261-020-00980-w [doi]', '10.1007/s40261-020-00980-w [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2020 Dec;40(12):1177-1181. doi: 10.1007/s40261-020-00980-w.

Their roles in the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells, induction of angiogenesis, and invasive tumor growth have been recognized for over 2 decades. CXCR4 is a promising target for imaging and therapy of both hematologic and solid tumors. To date, Sanofi Genzyme's plerixafor is the only marketed CXCR4 inhibitor (i.e., Food and Drug Administration-approved in 2008 for stem cell mobilization). However, several new CXCR4 inhibitors are now being investigated as potential therapies for a variety of fluid and solid tumors. These small molecules, peptides, and Abs include balixafortide (POL6326, Polyphor), mavorixafor (X4P-001, X4 Pharmaceuticals), motixafortide (BL-8040, BioLineRx), LY2510924 (Eli Lilly), and ulocuplumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Early clinical evidence has been encouraging, for example, with motixafortide and balixafortide, and the CXCR4 inhibitors appear to be generally safe and well tolerated. Molecular imaging is increasingly being used for effective patient selection before, or early during CXCR4 inhibitor treatment. The use of radiolabeled theranostics that combine diagnostics and therapeutics is an additional intriguing approach. The current status and future directions for radioimaging and treating patients with CXCR4-expressing hematologic and solid malignancies are reviewed.

Chief among these is ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which produces deep, durable responses in CLL with good tolerability (Haematologica, 103, 2018 and e204). Though prolonged exposure to the drug can exert selective pressure on CLL cells and allow for the emergence of drug-resistant clones, primary ibrutinib treatment failure is rare (Expert Rev Hematol, 11 and 2018, 185; N Engl J Med, 370, 2014 and 2352; N Engl J Med, 373, 2015 and 25, 2425; Blood, 128, 2016 and 2199). Activating mutations in the gene PLCG2, which encodes a downstream target of BTK, appear to enable constitutive BCR signaling and have been associated with ibrutinib resistance (Int J Cancer, 146 and 2020, 85; J Clin Oncol, 35, 2017 and 1437; Blood, 126, 2015 and 61). In recent years, novel investigational agents have targeted other components of the BCR pathway. Among these is entospletinib, an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of splenic tyrosine kinase (SYK) (Blood, 126, 2015 and 1744), which lies upstream of the enzyme phospholipase C-gamma-2 (PLCG2). Here, we describe a patient who was found to harbor a novel somatic variant of PLCG2 and experienced a lack of treatment response to both ibrutinib and entospletinib.",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

From 1977 to 2014, 1274 and 1143 patients were diagnosed with ATL or PTCL-NOS, respectively. Recently, the incidence of both diseases has gradually increased, and the age at diagnosis has risen. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates in ATL patients were 12.0% in era 1 (1977-1999), 12.4% in era 2 (2000-2008), and 17.5% in era 3 (2009-2014) (P < 0.001). The 3-year OS rates in PTCL-NOS patients were 27.6% in era 1, 36.2% in era 2, and 35.0% in era 3 (P = 0.049). In conclusion, the incidences of ATL and PTCL-NOS have been increasing, particularly in elderly individuals.

Despite the prognostic and therapeutic importance of mutational analysis, the mutational landscape of hypocellular AML is not well understood. METHODS: We identified 25 patients with hypocellular AML, and 141 patients with nonhypocellular AML were identified as a control group. We applied next-generation sequencing for the first time to profile this entity. RESULTS: The hypocellular AML patients were older than those with nonhypocellular AML (P = .037). At diagnosis, hypocellular AML had lower leukocyte counts (P = .012), higher hemoglobin (P = .003), and lower blast counts in the peripheral blood (P < .001) and bone marrow (P = .003). Hypocellular AML was less likely to have mutations involving cell proliferation (P = .027) and NPM1 (P = .022) compared with nonhypocellular AML. Hypocellular AML showed a high incidence of spliceosomal mutations and myelodysplastic syndrome-defining chromosome abnormalities (65%), but the incidence was not significantly different from that in nonhypocellular AML. There was no significant survival difference between hypocellular and nonhypocellular AML. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate hypocellular AML showed fewer genetic alterations involving cell proliferation and NPM1 when compared directly with nonhypocellular AML; this finding likely contributes to the low marrow cellularity in at least a portion of the patients with hypocellular AML.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Implicated in relapse is a reservoir of MM if cells lacking sufficient BCMA surface expression (antigen escape). We demonstrate that simultaneous targeting of an additional antigen-here, G protein-coupled receptor class-C group-5 member-D (GPRC5D)-can prevent BCMA escape-mediated relapse in a model of MM. To identify an optimal approach, we compare subtherapeutic doses of different forms of dual-targeted cellular therapy. These include (1) parallel-produced and pooled mono-targeted CAR T-cells, (2) bicistronic constructs expressing distinct CARs from a single vector, and (3) a dual-scFv ""single-stalk"" CAR design. When targeting BCMA-negative disease, bicistronic and pooled approaches had the highest efficacy, whereas for dual-antigen-expressing disease, the bicistronic approach was more efficacious than the pooled approach.

Methods: We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients. Findings: Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. COVID-19 patients were sub-classified into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. Medical records were reviewed and patients were risk stratified based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27.8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, increased red blood cell distribution width, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Interpretation: There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.

The hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) is an alternative treatment for elderly and relapsed/refractory AML patients, yet responses following DAC monotherapy are still modest. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor CD105 (endoglin) is expressed in various hematopoietic malignancies, and high CD105 expression correlates with poor prognosis in AML patients. Using a xenograft model, we have recently demonstrated that targeting CD105(+) AML blasts with the TRC105 monoclonal antibody inhibits leukemia progression. Here we investigated whether administration of TRC105 along with DAC could represent a novel therapeutic option for relapsed/refractory AML. Our data show that the DAC/TRC105 combination results in a more durable anti-leukemic effect in AML xenografts compared to DAC monotherapy. Moreover, the DAC/TRC105 combination enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, which correlated with reduced leukemia burden. RNA-sequencing studies suggest that TRC105 may alter TGF-beta activity in AML blasts. Taken together, these findings provide rationale for the clinical evaluation of TRC105 in combination with DAC in AML patients.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

In the present article, through the presentation of five illustrative cases of patients with melanoma and CLL, several aspects of this complex relationship are highlighted, with a focus on the increased incidence of melanoma in patients with CLL, its speculated etiology, and the impact of CLL stage and disease duration on the incidence and prognosis of melanoma. Furthermore, the rare entity of the synchronous diagnosis of melanoma and CLL in biopsied lymph nodes is discussed, along with its implications on the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In addition, the available data on the treatment choices in patients with melanoma and CLL are presented and the efficacy and safety of fludarabine, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, new targeted therapies for CLL, and checkpoint inhibitors are further discussed. Finally, since no formal guidelines are available for the management of this group of patients, guidelines are proposed for skin-cancer screening in patients with CLL, for the correct interpretation of BRAF mutation analysis in lymph-node specimens with 'collision of tumors,' and for the optimal use of imaging studies in the diagnosis of metastatic disease in patients with CLL and melanoma, while a treatment approach for such patients is also suggested.

Materials and Methods: The amount of mRNA and protein of TIM-3 measured in the BM and PB the mononuclear layer of samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Results: Our findings indicated that relative mRNA expression of TIM-3 in PB and BM of the mononuclear layer of ALL patients was 1.7 and 5 times higher than normals, respectively. We also reported that the protein level of TIM-3 in mononuclear cells of ALL patients was 3.2-fold in BM and two-fold in PB more than normals.

During adaptive immune responses, CXCL13 plasma concentrations transiently increase and function as a biomarker for normal germinal center activity. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of CXCR5, the receptor for CXCL13, and proliferate in pseudofollicles within secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). Given the morphologic and functional similarities between normal and CLL B-cell expansion in SLO, we hypothesized that CXCL13 plasma concentrations would correlate with CLL disease activity and progression. We analyzed CXCL13 plasma concentrations in 400 CLL patients and correlated the findings with other prognostic markers, time to treatment (TTT), CCL3 and CCL4 plasma concentrations, and in vivo CLL cell proliferation. We found that CXCL13 plasma concentrations were higher in CLL patients with active and advanced stage disease, resulting in a significantly shorter TTT. Accordingly, high CXCL13 levels correlated with other markers of disease activity and CCL3 levels. Higher CLL cell birth rates in vivo also associated with higher CXCL13 plasma concentrations. Interestingly, elevated CXCL13 plasma levels normalized during ibrutinib therapy, and increased in ibrutinib resistance patients.

Research on miRNA-disease associations is helpful not only for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, but also for new drug identification and lead compound discovery. A novel sequence- and symptom-based random forest algorithm model (Seq-SymRF) was developed to identify potential associations between miRNA and disease. Features derived from sequence information and clinical symptoms were utilized to characterize miRNA and disease, respectively. Moreover, the clustering method by calculating the Euclidean distance was adopted to construct reliable negative samples. Based on the fivefold cross-validation, Seq-SymRF achieved the accuracy of 98.00%, specificity of 99.43%, sensitivity of 96.58%, precision of 99.40% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9604, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve were 0.9967 and 0.9975, respectively. Additionally, case studies were implemented with leukemia, breast neoplasms and hsa-mir-21. Most of the top-25 predicted disease-related miRNAs (19/25 for leukemia; 20/25 for breast neoplasms) and 15 of top-25 predicted miRNA-related diseases were verified by literature and dbDEMC database. It is anticipated that Seq-SymRF could be regarded as a powerful high-throughput virtual screening tool for drug research and development.

The single-cell data reveals cell-level mutation co-occurrence and enables reconstruction of mutational histories characterized by linear and branching patterns of clonal evolution, with the latter including convergent evolution. Through xenotransplantion, we show leukemia initiating capabilities of individual subclones evolving in parallel. Also, by simultaneous single-cell DNA and cell surface protein analysis, we illustrate both genetic and phenotypic evolution in AML. Lastly, single-cell analysis of longitudinal samples reveals underlying evolutionary process of therapeutic resistance.

The Tal1(cko) mutant mice are hyperactive, impulsive, hypersensitive to reward, have learning deficits and a habituation defect in a novel environment. Only minor changes in their dopaminergic system were detected. Amphetamine induced striatal dopamine release and amphetamine induced place preference were normal in Tal1(cko) mice. Increased dopamine signaling failed to stimulate the locomotor activity of the Tal1(cko) mice, but instead alleviated their hyperactivity.

Thus, a detailed meta-analysis of cohort studies was conducted to elucidate this association. Eligible studies were screened through the electronic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from their inception to August 11, 2020. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed through the random-effects model. Eighteen articles involving 10,516 leukemia cases among a total of 4,094,235 diabetic patients were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, twenty-five RRs were synthesized for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and yielded a summary RR of 1.33 (95%CI, 1.21-1.47; p < 0.001). For type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 7 RRs were combined, however, the pooled RR was insignificant (RR, 1.08; 95%CI, 0.87-1.34; p = 0.48). Interestingly, the summary RR for East Asia (RR, 1.83, 95%CI, 1.63-2.06) was significantly higher than that for Europe (RR, 1.11, 95%CI, 1.06-1.15), Western Asia (RR, 1.40, 95%CI, 1.25-1.54), North America (RR, 1.14, 95%CI, 1.08-1.20), and Australia (RR, 1.47, 95%CI, 1.25-1.71). Moreover, we found that patients with a shorter T2DM duration (1-5 years) had a higher risk of leukemia compared to those with a longer duration (5.1-10 years). Overall, this meta-analysis suggests there is a moderately increased risk of leukemia among T2DM patients, but not in T1DM patients.

Therefore, we collected blood samples of 168 beef cattle from slaughterhouses in three governorates in Egypt. Based on BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2 targeting long terminal repeats and nested PCR targeting the env-gp51 gene, the BLV provirus infection rates were found to be 47/168 (28.0%) and 42/168 (25.0%), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 501 bp of the BLV env-gp51 gene from 42 BLV isolates revealed that at least six distinctive strains (b, e, f, g, x, and z) were prevalent in cattle across the examined regions. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the 420 bp sequence of the BLV env-gp51 region of the six strains against 11 known genotypes showed that the strains b, e, f, and g were clustered into genotype-1, and strains x and z were clustered into genotype-4. Our results also indicated that strains b and x exist in both dairy and beef cattle in Egypt.

Endoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal TNKCL have not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we demonstrated the clinical characteristics of colorectal TNKCL. METHODS: Endoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics were investigated in 27 patients with colorectal monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and other types of TNKCL. RESULTS: Nine TNKCL patients (33%) were classified as MEITL, 11 (41%) as ATLL, and seven (26%) as other. Four patients with Epstein-Barr Virus-positive (EBV+) TNKCL, two indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and one anaplastic large cell lymphoma were included in the other group. Endoscopically, six MEITL (67%) and five ATLL (46%) showed diffuse-infiltrating type, in which the main endoscopic lesion was edematous mucosa in MEITL, while aphthoid erosion and edematous mucosa were typical in ATLL. Ulcerative type was identified in four other group patients (57%), including two EBV+ TNKCL. An increase in atypical T-intraepithelial lymphocytes (T-IELs) was noted in seven MEITL (88%) and six ATLL (60%) patients, but not in the other group (0%) patients. Five MEITL patients (56%) showed features of lymphocytic proctocolitis with increased CD8+ T-IELs. CONCLUSIONS: MEITL and ATLL occasionally invaded the colorectum, and primary involving MEITL was observed. Diffuse infiltrating type was the characteristic endoscopic finding in colorectal MEITL and ATLL, while ulcerative type was observed in the other group.

Five weeks before the hospitalisation, she was diagnosed with optic neuritis due to a decline in the visual acuity of the right eye. She was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by prednisolone (PSL), before the hospitalisation, which were not effective. Blood tests showed increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, liver injury, and thrombocytopenia. Abdominal echo revealed numerous enlarged lymph nodes in the hepatic portal region. Malignant lymphoma was suspected due to high serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor. None of the treatments were effective, and she died on the fifth hospital day.

In our experiments, 70% ethanolic extracts of P. pterocarpum leaves (LPP) and stem bark (SPP) were evaluated for their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. Both LPP and SPP inhibited Cu(2+)-mediated LDL by increasing the lag time of conjugated diene formation and inhibiting the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in a dose-dependent manner. In cancer cells, LPP and SPP triggered the most potent cytotoxic effects against human leukemia cells, CRF-SBA and HL-60, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 118.5 to 157.2 microg/mL. SPP exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MIA PACA2, A549, and KG cell lines with IC50 values of 167.5, 244.1 and 255.0 microg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, LPP showed cytotoxic activity against KG with an IC50 value of 228.1 microg/mL. SPP mediated cytotoxicity in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells through the activation of the apoptosis pathway, including the activation of caspases 3, and 9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results suggested that SPP may prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis and leukemia in humans.",,"['Kim, Seon-Rye', 'Cuong To, Dao Cuong', 'Nguyen, Phi Hung', 'Nguyen, Yen Nhi', 'Cho, Byung-Jun', 'Tran, Manh Hung']","['Kim SR', 'Cuong To DC', 'Nguyen PH', 'Nguyen YN', 'Cho BJ', 'Tran MH']","['Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, 1 Gangwondaegakgil Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do 24341, Korea.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Phenikaa University, Yen Nghia, Ha Dong district, Hanoi 12116, Vietnam.', 'Phenikaa Research and Technology Institute (PRATI), A&A Green Phoenix Group JSC, 167 Hoang Ngan, Cau Giay District, Hanoi 11313, Vietnam.', 'Institute of Natural Products Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet street, Cau Giay District, Hanoi 122100, Vietnam.', 'University of Science, Vietnam National University Hochiminh City, 227 Nguyen Van Cu street, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City 748000, Vietnam.', 'Department of Emergency Medical Technology, College of Health Science, Kangwon National University, 346 Hwangjo-gil, Dogye-up, Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do 25945, Korea.', 'University of Science, Vietnam National University Hochiminh City, 227 Nguyen Van Cu street, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City 748000, Vietnam.']",['eng'],['104.01-2017.57/National Foundation for Science and Technology Development'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Fabaceae/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Vietnam']",PMC7587549,,2020/10/23 06:00,2021/03/27 06:00,['2020/10/22 01:01'],"['2020/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25204800 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25204800 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Oct 19;25(20). pii: molecules25204800. doi: 10.3390/molecules25204800.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6678-4253', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3735-9482']",20201019,['NOTNLM'],"['LDL', 'Peltophorum pterocarpum', 'anti-oxidant', 'caspases', 'human leukemia cancer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1997, the CD20-targeting mAb rituximab was the first mAb to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cancer. Within two decades, dozens of mAbs entered the clinic for treatment of several hematological cancers and solid tumors, and numerous more are under clinical investigation. The success of mAbs as cancer therapeutics lies in their ability to induce various cytotoxic machineries against specific targets. These cytotoxic machineries include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which are all mediated via the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of mAbs. In this review article, we will outline the novel approaches of engineering these Fc domains of mAbs to enhance their Fc-effector function and thereby their anti-tumor potency, with specific focus to summarize their (pre-) clinical status for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), and multiple myeloma (MM).",,"['van der Horst, Hilma J', 'Nijhof, Inger S', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Chamuleau, Martine E D']","['van der Horst HJ', 'Nijhof IS', 'Mutis T', 'Chamuleau MED']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, VU Medical Center, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7603375,,2020/10/23 06:00,2020/10/23 06:01,['2020/10/22 01:01'],"['2020/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12103041 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12103041 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Oct 19;12(10). pii: cancers12103041. doi: 10.3390/cancers12103041.,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7997-1138'],20201019,['NOTNLM'],"['B-CLL', 'B-cell lymphoma', 'B-cell malignancies', 'Fc engineering', 'antibody therapy', 'immunotherapy', 'multiple myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) may have developed secondary myelodysplasia before therapy. Bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis is regulated by a spectrum of epigenetic factors, among which microRNAs (miRNAs) are special. The aim of this work is to profile miRNA expression in BM cells in untreated NHL patients with secondary myelodysplasia. A comparative analysis of miRNA expression levels between the NHL and non-cancer blood disorders samples revealed that let-7a-5p was upregulated, and miR-26a-5p, miR-199b-5p, miR-145-5p and miR-150-5p were downregulated in NHL with myelodysplasia (p < 0.05). We for the first time developed a profile of miRNA expression in BM samples in untreated NHL patients with secondary myelodysplasia. It can be assumed that the differential diagnosis for blood cancers and secondary BM conditions based on miRNA expression profiles will improve the accuracy and relevance of the early diagnosis of cancerous and precancerous lesions in BM.",,"['Veryaskina, Yuliya Andreevna', 'Titov, Sergei Evgenievich', 'Kovynev, Igor Borisovich', 'Pospelova, Tatiana Ivanovna', 'Zhimulev, Igor Fyodorovich']","['Veryaskina YA', 'Titov SE', 'Kovynev IB', 'Pospelova TI', 'Zhimulev IF']","['Laboratory of Gene Engineering, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, SB RAS, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.', 'Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, SB RAS, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.', 'Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, SB RAS, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.', 'AO Vector-Best, Novosibirsk 630117, Russia.', 'Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, Novosibirsk 630091, Russia.', 'Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, Novosibirsk 630091, Russia.', 'Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, SB RAS, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC7656297,,2020/10/23 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/10/22 01:01'],"['2020/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9102318 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9102318 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Oct 19;9(10). pii: cells9102318. doi: 10.3390/cells9102318.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3799-9407', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9401-5737']",20201019,['NOTNLM'],"['*anemia', '*miRNA', '*myelodysplasia', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', ""*non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic and clinicopathological effects of BMI-1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) have been in dispute with different studies. Eligible studies were retrieved from international databases up to December 2019. Studies with a relationship between the clinicopathological and prognostic value of CRC patients with BMI-1 expression were selected. The correlations in the random-effect model were evaluated using the hazard ratios, odds ratio, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of nine studies comprising Asian cases (seven studies) and European cases (two studies) covering 1,294 samples of CRC were included for this meta-analysis. The analysis suggested that in Asian cases, increased expression of BMI-1 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) and death-free survival, whereas in European populations, high expression of BMI-1 was associated with better OS. Also, overexpression of BMI-1 in the Asian population was associated with the tumor size, distant metastasis, and patient's gender and age. Results suggested that high expression of BMI-1 can be involved in the progression and invasion of CRC, and so its inhibitor-based therapies could be used to prevent the progression of CRC.","['(c) 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Pourjafar, Mona', 'Samadi, Pouria', 'Karami, Manoochehr', 'Najafi, Rezvan']","['Pourjafar M', 'Samadi P', 'Karami M', 'Najafi R']","['Student Research Committee, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Health Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.']",['eng'],"['9709135481/Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran']",['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,,IM,,,,2020/10/22 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2020/10/21 20:09'],"['2020/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/21 20:09 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bab.2053 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2021 Dec;68(6):1313-1322. doi: 10.1002/bab.2053.

Here, we identify KMT2D as a potent tumor suppressor in melanoma through an in vivo epigenome-focused pooled RNAi screen and confirm the finding by using a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) based on conditional and melanocyte-specific deletion of KMT2D. KMT2D-deficient tumors show substantial reprogramming of key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis. KMT2D deficiency aberrantly upregulates glycolysis enzymes, intermediate metabolites, and glucose consumption rates. Mechanistically, KMT2D loss causes genome-wide reduction of H3K4me1-marked active enhancer chromatin states. Enhancer loss and subsequent repression of IGFBP5 activates IGF1R-AKT to increase glycolysis in KMT2D-deficient cells. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis and insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling reduce proliferation and tumorigenesis preferentially in KMT2D-deficient cells. We conclude that KMT2D loss promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating an increased use of the glycolysis pathway for enhanced biomass needs via enhancer reprogramming, thus presenting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention through glycolysis or IGF pathway inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Molecular remission is a primary goal of treatment. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 single-group trial of first-line therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL (with no upper age limit). Dasatinib plus glucocorticoids were administered, followed by two cycles of blinatumomab. The primary end point was a sustained molecular response in the bone marrow after this treatment. RESULTS: Of the 63 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 24 to 82) who were enrolled, a complete remission was observed in 98%. At the end of dasatinib induction therapy (day 85), 29% of the patients had a molecular response, and this percentage increased to 60% after two cycles of blinatumomab; the percentage of patients with a molecular response increased further after additional blinatumomab cycles. At a median follow-up of 18 months, overall survival was 95% and disease-free survival was 88%; disease-free survival was lower among patients who had an IKZF1 deletion plus additional genetic aberrations (CDKN2A or CDKN2B, PAX5, or both [i.e., IKZF1 (plus)]). ABL1 mutations were detected in 6 patients who had increased minimal residual disease during induction therapy, and all these mutations were cleared by blinatumomab. Six relapses occurred. Overall, 21 adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recorded. A total of 24 patients received a stem-cell allograft, and 1 death was related to transplantation (4%). CONCLUSIONS: A chemotherapy-free induction and consolidation first-line treatment with dasatinib and blinatumomab that was based on a targeted and immunotherapeutic strategy was associated with high incidences of molecular response and survival and few toxic effects of grade 3 or higher in adults with Ph-positive ALL.

However, the survival rates in the developing world are below 40%. The main contributing factors to these reduced survival rates are a late presentation, malnutrition and high treatment-related mortality. AIM: To document the factors affecting treatment outcome of childhood AML at a tertiary care facility of Pakistan. METHODS AND RESULTS: All newly registered cases of AML under 18 years of age from January 1, 2012 onwards who completed their treatment before November 30, 2019 were included. Data of 219 cases of AML containing 140 (63.9%) males and 79 (36.1%) females was analyzed. The mean age was 6.30 +/- 3.66 years. Pallor was the commonest presenting features in 180 (82.2%) and M2 was the commonest French American-British (FAB) subtype in 103 (47.0%) cases. In univariate analysis, high white blood cells (WBC) count at presentation (P = .006), poor nutritional status (P = .005), unfavourable cytogenetics (P = .019), certain types of FAB AML subtype (P = .005), and use of etoposide in induction chemotherapy (P = .042) significantly adversely affected overall survival (OS). Neutropenic sepsis and bleeding were the major causes of treatment-related mortality. Response to induction chemotherapy was the most significant prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (P = <.001). After a median follow-up of 40.96 +/- 26.23 months, 5-year OS and DFS of the cohort were 40.6% and 38.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest cohort of childhood AML from Pakistan, high WBC count at presentation, malnutrition, unfavourable cytogenetics and use of etoposide during induction chemotherapy were associated with decreased OS and DFS rates. Response to the induction chemotherapy was the most significant prognostic factor.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Ghafoor, Tariq', 'Khalil, Sumaira', 'Farah, Tanzeela', 'Ahmed, Shakeel', 'Sharif, Imtenan']","['Ghafoor T', 'Khalil S', 'Farah T', 'Ahmed S', 'Sharif I']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology, Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, CMH Medical Complex, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Community medicine, National University of Medical Sciences, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/*epidemiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7941425,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/10/21 15:37'],"['2020/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 15:37 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1259 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2020 Oct;3(5):e1259. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1259.

In addition, we established messenger RNA expression profiles in purified sorted CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD38+ cells using gene array and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Aberrantly expressed markers were identified in all cohorts. In CML, CD34+/CD38- LSCs exhibited an almost invariable aberration profile, defined as CD25+/CD26+/CD56+/CD93+/IL-1RAP+. By contrast, in patients with AML, CD34+/CD38- cells variably expressed ""aberrant"" membrane antigens, including CD25 (48%), CD96 (40%), CD371 (CLL-1; 68%), and IL-1RAP (65%). With the exception of a subgroup of FLT3 internal tandem duplication-mutated patients, AML LSCs did not exhibit CD26. All other surface markers and target antigens detected on AML and/or CML LSCs, including CD33, CD44, CD47, CD52, CD105, CD114, CD117, CD133, CD135, CD184, and roundabout-4, were also found on normal BM stem cells. However, several of these surface targets, including CD25, CD33, and CD123, were expressed at higher levels on CD34+/CD38- LSCs compared with normal BM stem cells. Moreover, antibody-mediated immunological targeting through CD33 or CD52 resulted in LSC depletion in vitro and a substantially reduced LSC engraftment in NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Together, we have established surface marker and target expression profiles of AML LSCs and CML LSCs, which should facilitate LSC enrichment, diagnostic LSC phenotyping, and development of LSC-eradicating immunotherapies.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Herrmann, Harald', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Rulicke, Thomas', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Willmann, Michael', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Baumgartner, Sigrid', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Schulenburg, Axel', 'Mueller, Niklas', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Bilban, Martin', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Streubel, Berthold', 'Vallera, Daniel A', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Herrmann H', 'Sadovnik I', 'Eisenwort G', 'Rulicke T', 'Blatt K', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Willmann M', 'Stefanzl G', 'Baumgartner S', 'Greiner G', 'Schulenburg A', 'Mueller N', 'Rabitsch W', 'Bilban M', 'Hoermann G', 'Streubel B', 'Vallera DA', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Companion Animals and Horses, Clinic for Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Pediatric Intensive Care and Neuropediatrics.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Central Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; and.', 'University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells']",PMC7594398,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/21 15:36'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 15:36 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31907-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001742 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Oct 27;4(20):5118-5132. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001742.,5118-5132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite significant advances in the treatment of the disease, relapse and drug resistance are not uncommon. In the current study, we investigated the dual PI3/PIM kinase inhibitor IBL-202 in combination with venetoclax as a treatment option for CLL using both primary CLL cells and TP53-deficient OSU-CLL cells generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. IBL-202 and venetoclax were highly synergistic against primary CLL cells cocultured with CD40L fibroblasts (combination index [CI], 0.4, at a fractional effect of 0.9) and TP53-knockout (KO) OSU-CLL cells (CI, 0.5, at a fractional effect of 0.9). Synergy between the drugs was consistent, with a significant (P < .05) reduction in the 50% inhibitory concentration for both drugs. IBL-202 and venetoclax in combination induced cell-cycle arrest and slowed the proliferation of both wild-type and TP53-KO cell lines. The drug combination inhibited AKT phosphorylation, reduced expression of Bcl-xL and NF-kappaB, and increased the Noxa/Mcl-1 ratio. Downregulation of CXCR4 was consistent with inhibition of the SDF-1alpha-induced migratory capacity of CLL cells. Synergy between IBL-202 and venetoclax against primary CLL cells cultured under conditions that mimic the tumor microenvironment suggests this drug combination may be effective against CLL cells within the lymph nodes and bone marrow.

Bohan and Peter categorized myopathies into 7 classes.[1] Polymyositis, an autoimmune and chronic inflammatory myopathy, is characterized by symmetrical proximal muscle weakness due to the involvement of endomysial layers of skeletal muscles versus dermatomyositis, which involves the perimysial layers of muscles along with dermatological presentations.[2] Polymyositis develops over the months as compared to inclusion body myositis (IBM), which is a slowly progressive chronic myopathy developing in older individuals over a period of months to years with more severe symptoms. IBM develops secondary to either an autoimmune reaction or due to a degenerative process as a result of a persistent retroviral infection such as human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1).[3] Being an autoimmune disorder, polymyositis, a rheumatological disease, requires long-term treatment with steroids or immunomodulators along with the treatment of the underlying etiological factors. Although this is a rare disorder, polymyositis should be a part of the differential diagnosis of patients experiencing unexplained muscle weakness as the failure to make a diagnosis can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life due to severe complications.","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Sarwar, Ayesha', 'Dydyk, Alexander M.', 'Jatwani, Shraddha']","['Sarwar A', 'Dydyk AM', 'Jatwani S']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,2020/10/23 06:01,2020/10/23 06:01,,,['NBK563129 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20201023,['20211013'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],,,['2020/10/23 06:01'],,,

However, the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis remain unclear. Unlike many classical leukemogens that damage hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/HPC) directly in the bone marrow, FA-as the smallest, most reactive aldehyde-is thought to be incapable of reaching the bone marrow through inhalation exposure. A recent breakthrough study discovered that mouse lung contains functional HSC/HPC that can produce blood cells and travel bi-directionally between the lung and bone marrow, while another early study reported the presence of HSC/HPC in rat nose. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that FA inhalation could induce toxicity in HSC/HPC present in mouse lung and/or nose rather than in the bone marrow. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a commercially available protocol for culturing burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies from bone marrow and spleen to also enable culture of these colonies from mouse lung and nose, a novel application of this assay. We reported that in vivo exposure to FA at 3 mg/m(3) or ex vivo exposure up to 400 microM FA decreased the formation of both colony types from mouse lung and nose as well as from bone marrow and spleen. These findings, to the best of our knowledge, are the first empirically to show that FA exposure can damage mouse pulmonary and olfactory HSC/HPC and provide potential biological plausibility for the induction of leukemia at the sites of entry rather than the bone marrow.",,"['Zhao, Yun', 'Magana, Laura C', 'Cui, Haiyan', 'Huang, Jiawei', 'McHale, Cliona M', 'Yang, Xu', 'Looney, Mark R', 'Li, Rui', 'Zhang, Luoping']","['Zhao Y', 'Magana LC', 'Cui H', 'Huang J', 'McHale CM', 'Yang X', 'Looney MR', 'Li R', 'Zhang L']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, School of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, School of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, School of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, School of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, School of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China. ruili@mail.ccnu.edu.cn.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. luoping@berkeley.edu.']",['eng'],"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL107386/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lung/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nose/*drug effects', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/drug effects']",PMC7878325,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/10/21 12:24'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/21 12:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-020-02932-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-020-02932-x [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2021 Feb;95(2):693-701. doi: 10.1007/s00204-020-02932-x.

METHODS: Data were extracted from the Spanish Ministry of Health records via a claims database containing patient records from 192 private and 313 public hospitals between 1997 and 2015 for AML, and 2008 and 2015 for MDS. Direct medical costs at the hospital level were calculated based on mean medical procedure costs determined per the Spanish Ministry of Health. RESULTS: Records for 39,568 patients with AML and 33,091 with MDS were analyzed. The median age of AML patients was 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 27) and of MDS patients was 81 years (IQR = 12). In terms of disease management, 58% and 83% of admissions were due to emergencies for patients with AML and MDS, respectively; median length of hospital stay was 14 days (IQR = 25) for AML and seven days (IQR = 9) for MDS. There was an increase in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations over time for patients with AML or MDS. Mean annual direct medical costs of AML and MDS, respectively, were euro66,422,245 and euro42,635,313 for total costs, and euro30,775 and euro10,312 per patient. Of the total costs, transplantations contributed total annual costs of euro15,843,982 and euro2,705,791 for patients with AML and MDS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel data to assist decision makers in allocating resources. AML and MDS represent a significant burden for the National Spanish Healthcare System, with substantial costs incurred in secondary care, principally associated with the increasing number of transplantations.",,"['Marsa, Alicia', 'Ascanio, Meritxell', 'Diaz-Garcia, Javier', 'Darba, Josep']","['Marsa A', 'Ascanio M', 'Diaz-Garcia J', 'Darba J']","['Department of Health Economics, BCN Health Economics & Outcomes Research SL, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Health Economics, BCN Health Economics & Outcomes Research SL, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Department, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Iberia, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Economics, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/therapy', 'Spain/epidemiology']",,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2020/10/21 12:19'],"['2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/21 12:19 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2020.1840180 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2020 Dec;23(12):1477-1484. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2020.1840180.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess perceived family impact and coping during the child's hospitalization for ALL treatment and identify potential predictors of perceived family impact. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: A total of 212 families with children hospitalized participated. The hospitalization impact and coping scales were used to assess perceived family impact and coping, respectively. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total score for perceived family impact was 88.11 (22.39); social impact received the highest average score. The mean (SD) total score for family coping was 39.02 (9.84). A significant decrease in family coping was associated with more readmissions. Predictors of perceived family impact were severity of the child's illness, total days of all admissions, and coping, accounting for 37% of the observed variance. CONCLUSIONS: Families were moderately affected by children's hospitalizations; social functioning was most affected. Families' perceived coping effectiveness decreased as the readmissions increased. The higher risk category a child's diagnosis is, the longer a child's hospitalization is, and the less perceived coping effectiveness, the higher family perceived impact. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings provide a direction for the development of family-centered supportive intervention programs. Nurses should be aware that the total days of admission and severity of a child's illness are significant factors associated with perceived family impact and likely justify special attention.

We performed targeted exome sequencing on 90 patients with SCLC, including two with c-SCLC, and discovered RUNX1T1 amplification specific to small cell tumors of both patients with c-SCLC, but in only 2 of 88 'pure' SCLC patients. RUNX1T1 was first identified in the fusion transcript AML1/ETO, which occurs in 12%-15% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We further show higher expression of RUNX1T1 in the SCLC component of another c-SCLC tumor by in situ hybridization. RUNX1T1 expression was enriched in SCLC compared with all other cancers, including NSCLC, in both cell lines and tumor specimens, as shown by mRNA level and western blotting. Transcriptomic analysis of hallmark genes decreased by stable RUNX1T1 overexpression revealed a significant change in E2F targets. Validation experiments in multiple lung cancer cell lines showed that RUNX1T1 overexpression consistently decreased CDKN1A (p21) expression and increased E2F transcriptional activity, which is commonly altered in SCLC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in these overexpressing cells demonstrated that RUNX1T1 interacts with the CDKN1A (p21) promoter region, which displayed parallel reductions in histone 3 acetylation. Furthermore, reduced p21 expression could be dramatically restored by HDAC inhibition using Trichostatin A. Reanalysis of ChIP-seq data in Kasumi-1 AML cells showed that knockdown of the RUNX1T1 fusion protein was associated with increased global acetylation, including the CDKN1A (p21) promoter. Thus, our study identifies RUNX1T1 as a biomarker and potential epigenetic regulator of SCLC.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are subgroups of immunoregulatory cells involved in modulating autoimmunity, inflammation, and transplantation reactions. Herein, by studying the number and function of Breg and Treg cell subsets in patients with AML, we explored their potential role in the pathogenesis of AML. Newly diagnosed AML patients, AML patients in complete remission, and healthy controls were enrolled. Flow cytometry was used to detect percentages of Bregs and Tregs. ELISA was conducted to detect IL-10 and TGF-beta in plasma. The mRNA levels of IL-10 and Foxp3 were measured with RT-qPCR. The relationship of Bregs and Tregs with the clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. There was a significant reduction in the frequencies of Bregs and an increase of Tregs in newly diagnosed AML patients compared with healthy controls. Meanwhile, patients in complete remission exhibited levels of Bregs and Tregs comparable to healthy controls. Furthermore, compared with healthy controls and AML patients in complete remission, newly diagnosed AML patients had increased plasma IL-10 but reduced TGF-beta. IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA levels were upregulated in the newly diagnosed AML patients. However, there were no significant differences in IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA levels between patients in complete remission and healthy controls. Bregs and Tregs have abnormal distribution in AML patients, suggesting that they might play an important role in regulating immune responses in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Qiaofeng Dong et al.'],"['Dong, Qiaofeng', 'Li, Guosheng', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Wang, Shuli', 'Yang, Shuhuan', 'Sang, Yuqi', 'Liu, Xinguang', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Dong Q', 'Li G', 'Fozza C', 'Wang S', 'Yang S', 'Sang Y', 'Liu X', 'Chen C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Heze Municipal Hospital, Heze 274000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.', 'Blood Diseases Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences University of Sassari, Sassari 07100, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Heze Municipal Hospital, Heze 274000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Heze Municipal Hospital, Heze 274000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Heze Municipal Hospital, Heze 274000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood/genetics', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",PMC7557919,"['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",2020/10/22 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/10/21 06:04'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 06:04 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/7023168 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Oct 6;2020:7023168. doi: 10.1155/2020/7023168. eCollection 2020.,7023168,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1808-4498', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5919-7624']",20201006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We constructed stable AML cell lines with downregulated expression of circRNF13, and then, we explored the effect of downregulation of circRNF13 expression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion through qRT-PCR, MTT curve, colony formation, transwell migration and invasion experiment, cell cycle, apoptosis, Caspase 3/7 assay, and other experiments. We also studied the expression of C-myc and Tenascin-C by qRT-PCR to explore the role of circRNF13. Results: When the expression of circRNF13 was downregulated, the proliferation rate of AML cells decreased significantly, the cell cycle was blocked to G1 phase, and apoptosis rate increased significantly. C-myc related to cell proliferation decreased significantly at RNA level. Furthermore, when the expression of circRNF13 was downregulated, the migration and invasion ability of AML cells was significantly reduced, and the expression of Tenascin-C related to migration and invasion also decreased significantly. The luciferase reporter assay system confirmed that miRNA-1224-5p was the direct target of circRNF13. Conclusion: CircRNF13 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of AML cells by regulating the expression of miRNA-1224-5p.

Complete blood count (CBC) examination by automated blood cell counter (ABCC) is a quick and convenient measurement for screening abnormalities of blood cells that are triggered by various pathogenic insults in disease diagnosis and for monitoring changes in the treatment of existing hematological conditions. However, CBC results are frequently affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors from blood samples, such as in the setting of hypergammaglobulinemia and certain anticoagulants. SHLE could also affect CBC results. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old Chinese male presented with painful foot numbness and abdominal pain. He was initially misdiagnosed as having a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) because of the marked abnormalities in CBC examination by the ABCC. Morphological evaluation of the bone marrow smears and biopsy showed no evidence of MPN. Gene mutations in Breakpoint cluster regions-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue 1 (BCR-ABL1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), myeloproliferative leukemia virus (MPL), and colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) were negative. Having noticed the thick chylomicron layer on blood samples and the dramatically fluctuating CBC results, we speculated that the fat droplets formed by shaking the blood samples in the setting of SHLE were mistakenly identified as blood cells due to the limited parameters of ABCC. Therefore, we removed a large part of the chylomicron layer and then reexamined the CBC, and the CBC results, as we expected, differed significantly from that of the sample before the chylomicron layer was removed. These significant differences had been validated by the subsequently repeated laboratory tests by measuring dual blood samples that the chylomicron layer was removed in one sample and was not in another, and comparing the CBC results. Computerized tomography reexamination of the upper abdomen revealed an exudative lesion surrounding his pancreas. After intensive consultation, definitive diagnosis was made as recurrent pancreatitis, hyperlipemia and pseudoerythrocytosis. CONCLUSION: SHLE may become a potential cause of misdiagnosis of hyperlipemia-related diseases as MPNs and the resultant mistreatment. It may also lead to the misinterpretation of transfusion indications in patients with hematological disorders who critically need blood transfusion for supportive treatment.","['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we present the first case reported until now. CASE SUMMARY: We describe a 64-year-old woman who presented with lumbar pain and was initially diagnosed with SBP. However, after one year of radiotherapy treatment, this patient experienced a long-standing bone-marrow-suppressive period and finally developed APL harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation, as confirmed by analyses of clinical features, bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetic examination, and molecular biology. On admission, the patient had disseminated intravascular coagulation and intracranial hemorrhage, and the peripheral blood and bone marrow smear displayed abundant abnormal promyelocytes. Unfortunately, she died when the definite diagnosis was made. CONCLUSION: The patient with t-APL harboring FLT3-ITD mutation evolving from SBP after radiotherapy had not been reported and had poor clinical outcomes. FLT3-ITD mutation in t-APL may be a potential pathogenesis of leukemogenesis. We should consider the potential risk of secondary neoplasms in SBP patients after radiotherapy.","['(c)The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

We sought to identify aberrant epigenetic traits that are enriched following exposure to treatment that could impact patient response to therapy. METHODS: Epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed for 20 patients at two timepoints during treatment. The prognostic significance of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was assessed in independent cohorts of 139 and 163 patients. Their functional role in drug sensitivity was assessed in vitro. RESULTS: We identified 490 DMRs following exposure to therapy, of which 31 were CLL-specific and independent of changes occurring in normal B-cell development. Seventeen DMR-associated genes were identified as differentially expressed following treatment in an independent cohort. Methylation of the HOXA4, MAFB and SLCO3A1 DMRs was associated with post-treatment patient survival, with HOXA4 displaying the strongest association. Re-expression of HOXA4 in cell lines and primary CLL cells significantly increased apoptosis in response to treatment with fludarabine, ibrutinib and idelalisib. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates enrichment for multiple CLL-specific epigenetic traits in response to chemotherapy that predict patient outcomes, and particularly implicate epigenetic silencing of HOXA4 in reducing the sensitivity of CLL cells to therapy.",,"['Barrow, Timothy M', 'Nakjang, Sirintra', 'Lafta, Fadhel', 'Bilotkach, Kateryna', 'Woodhouse, Laura', 'Junge, Gesa', 'Tudhope, Susan J', 'Wallis, Jonathan P', 'Marr, Helen', 'Marshall, Scott', 'Bown, Nick', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Strathdee, Gordon']","['Barrow TM', 'Nakjang S', 'Lafta F', 'Bilotkach K', 'Woodhouse L', 'Junge G', 'Tudhope SJ', 'Wallis JP', 'Marr H', 'Marshall S', 'Bown N', 'Willmore E', 'Strathdee G']","['Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. timothy.barrow@sunderland.ac.uk.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences & Wellbeing, University of Sunderland, Sunderland, UK. timothy.barrow@sunderland.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug Discovery Unit, Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'School of Medical Education, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug Discovery Unit, Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug Discovery Unit, Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Haematology City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Trust, Sunderland Royal Hospital, Sunderland, UK.', 'Northern Genetics Service, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Central Parkway, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Drug Discovery Unit, Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. gordon.strathdee@newcastle.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['14024/Bloodwise', '30015.088.045/PA/IXS/JGW Patterson Foundation (John George William Patterson', 'Foundation)']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '127609-92-1 (HOXA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC7852668,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2020/10/21 05:59'],"['2020/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/21 05:59 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-01117-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-01117-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2021 Jan;124(2):474-483. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-01117-8.

The remaining 167 patients formed the observation group. The primary endpoint of the randomized trial was incidence of aGvHD grade II between randomization and day +100 post HSCT. Analysis of the short-term preemptive prednisolone therapy in the randomized patients showed no significant difference in incidence or severity of acute GvHD (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 0.66-4.32, P = 0.27).

In the present study, prepubertal mice were treated by vincristine or cyclophosphamide commonly used in acute leukaemia treatment. The prepubertal exposure to cyclophosphamide, at a low gonadotoxic dose in humans (< 3.5 g/m(2)), led to morphological alterations of prepubertal testicular tissue. An increased proportion of spermatozoa with hypocondensed chromatin and oxidized DNA associated with decreased fertility were uncovered at adulthood. Short- and long-term morphological alterations of the testicular tissue, disturbed progression of spermatogenesis along with increased proportions of isolated flagella and spermatozoa with fragmented DNA were evidenced in vincristine-treated mice. Moreover, the fertility of mice exposed to vincristine was severely affected despite being considered low-risk for fertility in humans. Paternal exposure to vincristine or cyclophosphamide before puberty had no impact on offspring development.

Herein, we characterized the expression of miR-21, miR-155, miR-34c and miR-146a in bovine oocytes and cumulus cells during in vitro maturation (IVM) with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6 and IL-11 or unsupplemented controls. LIF-exposed COCs showed higher expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in oocytes, whereas miR-146a expression was increased in oocytes matured with IL-6 and IL-11. In cumulus cells, miR-155 expression was elevated by all treatments while only LIF increased miR-21 expression. Based on these results, we next examined how LIF exposure during IVM affected oocyte competence, through IVF and the expression of specific genes in GV- and MII-oocytes, in 2- and 8-cell embryos, and in Day 8-blastocysts. LIF supplementation did not affect cleavage rate, blastocyst yield or several other developmental parameters, but did increase hatching rate. LIF suppressed DPPA3, ZAR1 and NPM2 expression in 2 cell- and/or 8-cell embryos. LIF increased the expression of KAT2A and HSPA1A in MII-oocytes, and that of HDAC1, KAT2A and HSP90AA1 and the BAX:BCL2L1 ratio in 2-cell embryos. In contrast, HDAC1, KAT2A and HSP90AA1 expression and BAX:BCL2L1 ratio was lower in 8-cell embryos derived from LIF oocytes. IVM with LIF also increased the expression of DNMT3A, HSPA1A and HSP90AA1 in blastocysts.

Unveiling the downstream target genes of TP53 that fulfill its tumor suppressor function is an area of intense investigation. Zmat3 (also known as Wig-1 or PAG608) is one such downstream target of p53, whose loss in hemopoietic stem cells lacking the apoptosis and cell cycle regulators, Puma and p21, respectively, promotes the development of leukemia. The function of Zmat3 in tumorigenesis however remains unclear. Here, to investigate which oncogenic drivers co-operate with Zmat3 loss to promote neoplastic transformation, we utilized Zmat3 knockout mice in models of c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis and Kras(G12D)-driven lung adenocarcinoma development. Interestingly, unlike loss of p53, Zmat3 germline loss had little impact on the rate of tumor development or severity of malignant disease upon either the c-MYC or Kras(G12D) oncogenic activation. Furthermore, loss of Zmat3 failed to rescue Kras(G12D) primary lung tumor cells from oncogene-induced senescence. Taken together, we conclude that in the context of c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis or mutant Kras(G12D)-driven lung adenocarcinoma development, additional co-occurring mutations are required to resolve Zmat3 tumor suppressive activity.",,"['Best, Sarah A', 'Vandenberg, Cassandra J', 'Abad, Etna', 'Whitehead, Lachlan', 'Guiu, Laia', 'Ding, Sheryl', 'Brennan, Margs S', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Herold, Marco J', 'Sutherland, Kate D', 'Janic, Ana']","['Best SA', 'Vandenberg CJ', 'Abad E', 'Whitehead L', 'Guiu L', 'Ding S', 'Brennan MS', 'Strasser A', 'Herold MJ', 'Sutherland KD', 'Janic A']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. sutherland.k@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. sutherland.k@wehi.edu.au.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. ana.janic@upf.edu.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, VIC, 3052, Australia. ana.janic@upf.edu.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Doctor Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain. ana.janic@upf.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Wig1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (Amy1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (Salivary alpha-Amylases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Adenocarcinoma of Lung/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Salivary alpha-Amylases/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC7575595,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2020/10/21 05:55'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/21 05:55 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-03066-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-03066-9 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Oct 20;11(10):877. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-03066-9.,877,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4232-9432', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8891-8873', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9431-5817', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4388-9642', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5020-4891', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7539-7581', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7453-3366', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4200-2560']",20201020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In myeloid and lymphoid leukemias/lymphomas resulting from constitutive activation of FGFR1 kinases, resistance has been shown to be due either to mutations in FGFR1 or deletions of PTEN. RNA-Seq analysis of the resistant clones demonstrates expression changes in cell death pathways centering on the p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma) protein. Treatment with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) revealed that, in both FGFR1 mutation and Pten deletion-mediated resistance, sustained Akt activation in resistant cells leads to compromised Puma activation, resulting in suppression of TKI-induced apoptosis. This suppression of Puma is achieved as a result of sequestration of inactivated p-Foxo3a in the cytoplasm. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of Puma in leukemic cells led to an increased drug resistance in the knockout cells demonstrating a direct role in TKI resistance. Since Puma promotes cell death by targeting Bcl2, TKI-resistant cells showed high Bcl2 levels and targeting Bcl2 with Venetoclax (ABT199) led to increased apoptosis in these cells. In vivo treatment of mice xenografted with resistant cells using ABT199 suppressed leukemogenesis and led to prolonged survival.

However, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) driven by aberrantly high EVI1 expression has very poor prognosis. To investigate the effects of post-translational modifications on EVI1 function, we carried out a mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of EVI1 in AML and detected dynamic phosphorylation at serine 436 (S436). Wild-type EVI1 (EVI1-WT) with S436 available for phosphorylation, but not non-phosphorylatable EVI1-S436A, conferred haematopoietic progenitor cell self-renewal and was associated with significantly higher organised transcriptional patterns. In silico modelling of EVI1-S436 phosphorylation showed reduced affinity to CtBP1, and CtBP1 showed reduced interaction with EVI1-WT compared with EVI1-S436A. The motif harbouring S436 is a target of CDK2 and CDK3 kinases, which interacted with EVI1-WT. The methyltransferase DNMT3A bound preferentially to EVI1-WT compared with EVI1-S436A, and a hypomethylated cell population associated by EVI1-WT expression in murine haematopoietic progenitors is not maintained with EVI1-S436A. These data point to EVI1-S436 phosphorylation directing functional protein interactions for haematopoietic self-renewal.

Relevant factors including endogenous biotin and immunogenicity, however, have limited the use of PRIT with an anti-CD45 antibody streptavidin conjugate and radiolabeled DOTA-biotin. To overcome these limitations we designed anti-murine and anti-human CD45 bispecific antibody constructs using 30F11 and BC8 antibodies, respectively, combined with an anti-yttrium (Y)-DOTA single-chain variable fragment (C825) to capture a radiolabeled ligand. The bispecific construct targeting human CD45 (BC8-Fc-C825) had high uptake in leukemia HEL xenografts [7.8 +/- 0.02% percent injected dose/gram of tissue (% ID/g)]. Therapy studies showed that 70% of mice with HEL human xenografts treated with BC8-Fc-C825 followed by 44.4 MBq (1,200 muCi) of (90)Y-DOTA-biotin survived at least 170 days after therapy, while all nontreated controls required euthanasia because of tumor progression by day 32. High uptake at sites of leukemia (spleen and bone marrow) was also seen with 30F11-IgG1-C825 in a syngeneic disseminated SJL murine leukemia model (spleen, 9.0 +/- 1.5% ID/g and bone marrow, 8.1 +/- 1.2% ID/g), with minimal uptake in all other normal organs (<0.5% ID/g) at 24 hours after (90)Y-DOTA injections. SJL leukemia mice treated with the bispecific 30F11-IgG1-C825 and 29.6 MBq (800 muCi) of (90)Y-DOTA-biotin had a survival advantage compared with untreated leukemic mice (median, 43 vs. 30 days, respectively; P < 0.0001).

Although previous reports indicated that antitumor immunity contributes to TFR, its determinants are still unclear. We previously reported that allelic polymorphisms of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are associated with achievement of deep molecular response (DMR) in patients with CML-CP. Here, we examined the association between TFR and polymorphisms of KIRs and HLAs in patients who discontinued tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Seventy-six patients were enrolled, and their KIR and HLA polymorphisms and natural killer (NK) cell activation status were investigated as previously described. Overall, 33 patients discontinued TKIs, and 21 of 33 achieved TFR [63.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 44.9%-77.5%] at 1 year. Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex (HR, 0.157; 95% CI, 0.031-0.804; P = 0.003) and HLA-A*02:01, *11:01, or *24:02 (HR, 6.386; 95% CI, 1.701-23.980; P = 0.006) were associated with TFR. Patients who achieved DMR and discontinued TKIs exhibited higher NK cell activation status than those who did not. By contrast, there were no significant differences in NK cell activation status between the patients who achieved TFR and those who experienced molecular relapse. These results suggest NK cell activation status contributes to achievement of DMR, whereas T-cell-mediated immunity contributes to TFR in patients with CML-CP.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Ureshino, Hiroshi', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Tanaka, Hidenori', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Ureshino H', 'Shindo T', 'Tanaka H', 'Saji H', 'Kimura S']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan. sr0795@cc-saga-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Withholding Treatment']",,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2020/10/21 05:54'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/21 05:54 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-20-0336 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0336 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Jan;20(1):142-149. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0336.

In acute myeloid leukemia, IKZF1 deletion has been demonstrated recurrent, but whether IKZF1 mutation also exists in AML remained largely unknown. Herein, we analyzed the IKZF1 mutation in AML. In our cohort, the frequency of IKZF1 mutation was 2.6% (5/193), and 5 frameshift/nonsense mutations as well as 2 missense mutations were identified in total. Molecularly, IKZF1 mutation was absent in fusion gene-positive AML, but it was demonstrated as the significant concomitant genetic alteration with SF3B1 or bi-allele CEBPA mutation in AML. Clinically, two IKZF1, PTPN11 and SF3B1-mutated AML patients exhibited one aggressive clinical course and showed primary resistant to chemotherapy. Furthermore, we confirmed the recurrent IKZF1 mutation in AML with cBioPortal tool from OHSU, TCGA and TARGET studies. Interestingly, OHSU study also showed that SF3B1 mutation was the significant concomitant genetic alteration with IKZF1 mutation, indicating their strong synergy in leukemogenesis.

However, secondary life-threatening T-cell immunodeficiency due to shared expression of targeted antigens by healthy and malignant T cells is a main drawback of mAb-or CAR-based immunotherapies for T-ALL and other T-cell malignancies.

Patients affected by Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are frequently characterized by iron overload (IOL), due to continuous red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. This event impacts the overall survival (OS) and it is associated with increased mortality in lower-risk MDS patients. Accordingly, the oral iron chelator Deferasirox (DFX) has been reported to improve the OS and delay leukemic transformation. However, the molecular players and the biological mechanisms laying behind remain currently mostly undefined. The aim of this study has been to investigate the potential anti-leukemic effect of DFX, by functionally and molecularly analyzing its effects in three different leukemia cell lines, harboring or not p53 mutations, and in human primary cells derived from 15 MDS/AML patients. Our findings indicated that DFX can lead to apoptosis, impairment of cell growth only in a context of IOL, and can induce a significant alteration of mitochondria network, with a sharp reduction in mitochondrial activity. Moreover, through a remarkable reduction of Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2), known to regulate the stability of p53 and p73 proteins, we observed an enhancement of p53 transcriptional activity after DFX. Interestingly, this iron depletion-triggered signaling is enabled by p73, in the absence of p53, or in the presence of a p53 mutant form. In conclusion, we propose a mechanism by which the increased p53 family transcriptional activity and protein stability could explain the potential benefits of iron chelation therapy in terms of improving OS and delaying leukemic transformation.",,"['Calabrese, Chiara', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Stanga, Serena', 'Andreani, Giacomo', 'Ravera, Silvia', 'Maglione, Alessandro', 'Pironi, Lucrezia', 'Petiti, Jessica', 'Shahzad Ali, Muhammad Shahzad', 'Scaravaglio, Patrizia', 'Napoli, Francesca', 'Fava, Carmen', 'De Gobbi, Marco De', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Bracco, Enrico', 'Pergolizzi, Barbara', 'Cilloni, Daniela']","['Calabrese C', 'Panuzzo C', 'Stanga S', 'Andreani G', 'Ravera S', 'Maglione A', 'Pironi L', 'Petiti J', 'Shahzad Ali MS', 'Scaravaglio P', 'Napoli F', 'Fava C', 'De Gobbi M', 'Frassoni F', 'Saglio G', 'Bracco E', 'Pergolizzi B', 'Cilloni D']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience Rita Levi Montalcini, Neuroscience Institute Cavalieri Ottolenghi, University of Turin, 10126 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Human Anatomy Section, Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deferasirox/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC7589297,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/10/21 01:03'],"['2020/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21207674 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21207674 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Oct 16;21(20). pii: ijms21207674. doi: 10.3390/ijms21207674.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1454-0713', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4877-3929', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0803-1042', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7153-2248', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8640-2462', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3170-2817', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6346-4791']",20201016,['NOTNLM'],"['Deferasirox', 'MDM2', 'chelation', 'iron', 'leukemia', 'mitochondria', 'p21', 'p53', 'p73']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure of viridicatol was unambiguously established by X-ray diffraction analysis. In this study, a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced food allergy and the rat basophil leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cell model were established to explore the anti-allergic properties of viridicatol. On the basis of the mouse model, we found viridicatol to alleviate the allergy symptoms; decrease the levels of specific immunoglobulin E, mast cell protease-1, histamine, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and promote the production of interleukin-10 in the serum. The treatment of viridicatol also downregulated the population of B cells and mast cells (MCs), as well as upregulated the population of regulatory T cells in the spleen. Moreover, viridicatol alleviated intestinal villi injury and inhibited the degranulation of intestinal MCs to promote intestinal barrier repair in mice. Furthermore, the accumulation of Ca(2+) in RBL-2H3 cells was significantly suppressed by viridicatol, which could block the activation of MCs.

An impaired balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic stimuli determines chemorefractoriness and outcome. The low proliferation rate of CLL cells indicates that one of the primary mechanisms involved in disease development may be an apoptotic failure. Here, we study the clinical and functional significance of DRAK2, a novel stress response kinase that plays a critical role in apoptosis, T-cell biology, and B-cell activation in CLL. We have analyzed CLL patient samples and showed that low expression levels of DRAK2 were significantly associated with unfavorable outcome in our CLL cohort. DRAK2 expression levels showed a positive correlation with the expression of DAPK1, and TGFBR1. Consistent with clinical data, the downregulation of DRAK2 in MEC-1 CLL cells strongly increased cell viability and proliferation. Further, our transcriptome data from MEC-1 cells highlighted MAPK, NF-kappaB, and Akt and as critical signaling hubs upon DRAK2 knockdown.

However, recent DS reports in trials of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-inhibitor drugs in patients with IDH-mutated AML have raised concerns. Given the limited knowledge of the incidence of DS with differentiating agents, we conducted a systematic literature review of clinical trials with reports of DS to provide a comprehensive overview of the medications associated with DS. In particular, we focused on the incidence of DS reported among the IDH-inhibitors, compared to existing ATRA and ATO therapies. We identified 44 published articles, encompassing 39 clinical trials, including 6949 patients. Overall, the cumulative incidence of DS across all treatment regimens was 17.7%. Incidence of DS was notably lower in trials with IDH-inhibitors (10.4%) compared to other regimens, including ATRA and/or ATO (15.4-20.6%). Compared to other therapies, the median time to onset was four times longer with IDH-inhibitors (48 vs. 11 days).

In recent years, methylation dysregulation has been extensively studied and associated with risk groups and prognosis in adult AML, however, such studies in pediatric AML are limited. Moreover, the mutations in epigenetic genes such as DNMT3A, IDH1 or IDH2 are almost absent or rare in pediatric patients as compared to their abundance in adult AML. In the current study, we evaluated methylation patterns that occur with or independent of the well-defined cytogenetic features in pediatric AML patients enrolled on multi-site AML02 clinical trial (NCT00136084). Our results demonstrate that unlike adult AML, cytosine DNA methylation does not result in significant unique clusters in pediatric AML, however, DNA methylation signatures correlated significantly with the most common and recurrent cytogenetic features. Paired evaluation of DNA methylation and expression identified genes and pathways of biological relevance that hold promise for novel therapeutic strategies. Our results further demonstrate that epigenetic signatures occur complimentary to the well-established chromosomal/mutational landscape, implying that dysregulation of oncogenes or tumor suppressors might be leveraging both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to impact biological pathways critical for leukemogenesis.",,"['Lamba, Jatinder K', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Downing, James', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Pounds, Stanley']","['Lamba JK', 'Cao X', 'Raimondi S', 'Downing J', 'Ribeiro R', 'Gruber TA', 'Rubnitz J', 'Pounds S']","['Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA.', 'Department of Acute and Tertiary Care, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],['R01-CA132946/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7603219,,2020/10/22 06:00,2020/10/22 06:01,['2020/10/21 01:01'],"['2020/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12103024 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12103024 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Oct 17;12(10). pii: cancers12103024. doi: 10.3390/cancers12103024.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0411-0007', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4396-7460', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9956-5647']",20201017,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cytogenetics', '*pediatrics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperleukocytosis has been associated with an adverse prognosis and a higher incidence of life-threatening complications such as leukostasis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The molecular processes underlying hyperleukocytosis have not been fully elucidated yet. However, the interactions between leukemic blasts and endothelial cells leading to leukostasis and DIC as well as the processes in the bone marrow microenvironment leading to the massive entry of leukemic blasts into the peripheral blood are becoming increasingly understood. Leukemic blasts interact with endothelial cells via cell adhesion molecules such as various members of the selectin family which are upregulated via inflammatory cytokines released by leukemic blasts. Besides their role in the development of leukostasis, cell adhesion molecules have also been implicated in leukemic stem cell survival and chemotherapy resistance and can be therapeutically targeted with specific inhibitors such as plerixafor or GMI-1271 (uproleselan). However, in the absence of approved targeted therapies supportive treatment with the uric acid lowering agents allopurinol and rasburicase as well as aggressive intravenous fluid hydration for the treatment and prophylaxis of TLS, transfusion of blood products for the management of DIC, and cytoreduction with intensive chemotherapy, leukapheresis, or hydroxyurea remain the mainstay of therapy for AML patients with hyperleukocytosis.",,"['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Zeidan AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, PO Box 208028, New Haven, CT 06520-8028, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University School of Medicine, PO Box 208028, New Haven, CT 06520-8028, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Leukostasis/*complications', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy']",PMC7603052,,2020/10/22 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/10/21 01:01'],"['2020/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9102310 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9102310 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Oct 17;9(10). pii: cells9102310. doi: 10.3390/cells9102310.,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902'],20201017,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*DIC', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*disseminated intravascular coagulation', '*hyperleukocytosis', '*leukostasis', '*tumor lysis syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has the effect of anti-apoptosis, protecting macrophages that have engulfed pathogens and preventing pathogen clearance. Meanwhile, the MAPK signaling pathway plays a significant role in regulating Mcl-1 expression during tuberculosis infection. In the case of latent infection and active infection, the apoptosis and polarization of macrophages have a great influence during MTB infection, so we discussed the effect of Mcl-1 on apoptosis and polarization. Then, further discussed its mechanism. METHODS: An infected RAW264.7 macrophage model was established to investigate the regulatory role and mechanism of the Mcl-1 pathway inhibition during apoptosis and polarization of H37Rv infection. First, Mcl-1 protein and mRNA was identified by western blotting and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). RAW264.7 macrophage apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. RT-PCR was utilized to detect Bax, Caspase-3, Cyt-c and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. Next, Then the expression levels of inflammation factors CD86, CD206, iNOS, Fizz1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta was detected by ELISA. SEM was used to observe macrophages phenotype. Finally, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl the expression was detected by western blotting. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential using the JC-10 kit. RESULTS: In this study, we found that inhibiting the Mcl-1 expression signaling pathway led to infection by different virulence Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as changes in Mcl-1 protein and mRNA expression. Concomitantly macrophage apoptosis rate also changed, While, two phenotypic states of M1 and M2 appeared in the infected cells. We also found that the mitochondrial pathway was activated, the expression of its related genes Bax, casepase3, and Cyt-c, increased, whereas that of Bcl-2 decreased, and the mitochondrial membrane depolarization function was changed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that Mcl-1 affected the apoptosis and polarization of macrophages infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mainly M1 in the early stage and M2 in the later stage. In addition, mitochondria played a crucial role in this process.",,"['Han, Ling', 'Lu, Yang', 'Wang, Xiaofang', 'Zhang, Shujun', 'Wang, Yingzi', 'Wu, Fang', 'Zhang, Wanjiang', 'Wang, Xinmin', 'Zhang, Le']","['Han L', 'Lu Y', 'Wang X', 'Zhang S', 'Wang Y', 'Wu F', 'Zhang W', 'Wang X', 'Zhang L']","['Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.', 'Department of Urinary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical College of Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, the Key Laboratories for Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases, Medical College of Shihezi University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.7.- (HsaD protein, Mycobacterium tuberculosis)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*immunology', 'Macrophage Activation/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Virulence']",PMC7572003,,2020/10/22 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2020/10/21 01:01'],"['2020/10/21 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000022438 [doi]', '00005792-202010160-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Oct 16;99(42):e22438. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000022438.,e22438,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corylin is an isoflavone extracted from Cullen corylifolium (L.) Medik., which is widely used anti-inflammatory and anticancer in Asian countries. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in the occurrence and development of CRC. PURPOSE: To analyze the antitumor activity of corylin in CRC and to elucidate its molecular mechanisms of action. METHODS: The human CRC cell lines HCT116, RKO, and SW480 and immunodeficient mice were used as models to study the antitumor effect of corylin. The potent anti-proliferative, anti-migration and proapoptotic effects of corylin were observed by cell viability, colony formation assays, wound-healing migration assay, and cell apoptosis assay. Immunostaining analysis and western blot analysis revealed inhibition of the STAT3 signaling axis. RESULTS: We found that corylin could significantly reduce the viability and stimulate apoptosis in human CRC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Corylin decreased the expression levels of P-STAT3 and STAT3 target proteins, such as myeloid cell leukemia-1(MCL-1), Survivin, VEGF and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2). It also upregulated the expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and Cl-caspase 3. Moreover, corylin reduced the nuclear localization of STAT3. Furthermore, corylin inhibited the growth of the tumor in CRC mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide convincing results that could support the role of corylin in the treatment of CRC through inhibiting the STAT3 pathway. It is conceivable that corylin should be further explored as a unique STAT3 inhibitor in antitumor therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

The most abundant lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), is ingested during the dietary intake of flax, and is then metabolized in the gut into two mammalian lignan derivatives, Enterodiol (END) and Enterolactone (ENL). These lignans were previously reported to possess anti-tumor effects against breast, colon, and lung cancer. This study aims to investigate the potential anti-cancerous effect of the flaxseed lignans SDG, END and ENL on acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML) in vitro and to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism. AML cell lines, (KG-1 and Monomac-1) and a normal lymphoblastic cell line were cultured and treated with the purified lignans. ENL was found to be the most promising lignan, as it exhibits a significant selective dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect in both AML cell lines, contrary to normal cells. The cytotoxic effects observed were attributed to apoptosis induction, as revealed by an increase in Annexin V staining of AML cells with increasing ENL concentrations. The increase in the percentage of cells in the pre-G phase, in addition to cell death ELISA analysis, validated cellular and DNA fragmentation respectively. Analysis of protein expression using western blots confirmed the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway upon ENL treatment. This was also accompanied by an increase in ROS production intracellularly. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ENL has promising anti-cancer effects in AML cell lines in vitro, by promoting DNA fragmentation and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, highlighting the protective health benefits of flax seeds in leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

In this study, we analysed the role and expression of histamine receptor 1 (HRH1) in haematological malignancies. Although the histamine receptor type 1 was widely expressed in healthy and malignant haematopoiesis, especially along the myeloid lineage, HRH1 lacked a relevant role in survival/proliferation and chemoresistance of AML cells, as analysed by HRH1 knockdown (KD) and pharmacological modulation. However, HRH1-mediated signalling was critical for the activation of the differentiation process induced by several agents including all-trans retinoic acid, establishing a role for HRH1 in myeloid differentiation. Pharmacological activation of Erk was able to partially restore differentiation capacity in HRH1 KD AML cells, suggesting that HRH1 signalling acts upstream MAPK-Erk pathway. As an indirect consequence of our results, treatment-related histamine release is not expected to confer a proliferative advantage in leukaemic cells.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Despite their promising safety profile, SMs have had variable and limited success. Using a library of more than 5700 bioactive compounds, we screened for approaches that could sensitize AML cells to birinapant and identified multidrug resistance protein 1 inhibitors (MDR1i) as a class of clinically approved drugs that can enhance the efficacy of SM therapy. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of MDR1 increased intracellular levels of birinapant and sensitized AML cells from leukemia murine models, human leukemia cell lines, and primary AML samples to killing by birinapant. The combination of clinical MDR1 and IAP inhibitors was well tolerated in vivo and more effective against leukemic cells, compared with normal hematopoietic progenitors. Importantly, birinapant combined with third-generation MDR1i effectively killed murine leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and prolonged survival of AML-burdened mice, suggesting a therapeutic opportunity for AML.

Response to therapy informs risk, and morphology continues to be used more frequently than flow cytometry. Herein, the largest cohort of pediatric patients prospectively assessed for measurable residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry (N = 784) is reported. The ""difference from normal"" (DeltaN) technique was applied: 31% of all patients tested positive (AML range, 0.02% to 91%) after the first course of treatment on Children's Oncology Group study AAML0531. Detection of MRD following initial chemotherapy proved the strongest predicator of overall survival (OS) in univariable and multivariable analyses, and was predictive of relapse risk, disease-free survival, and treatment-related mortality. Clearance of MRD after a second round of chemotherapy did not improve survival. The morphologic definition of persistent disease (>15% AML) failed 27% of the time; those identified as MRD- had superior outcomes. Similarly, for patients not achieving morphologic remission (>5% blasts), 36% of patients were MRD- and had favorable outcomes compared with those who were MRD+ (P < .001); hence an increase in myeloid progenitor cells can be favorable when DeltaN classifies them as phenotypically normal. Furthermore, DeltaN reclassified 20% of patients in morphologic remission as having detectable MRD with comparable poor outcomes. Retrospective analysis using the relapse phenotype as a template demonstrated that 96% of MRD- patients had <0.02% of the relapse immunophenotype in their end of induction 1 marrow. Thus, the detection of abnormal myeloid progenitor cells by DeltaN is both specific and sensitive, with a high predictive signal identifiable early in treatment.

Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that derive from monocyte-/macrophage-lineage cells and resorb bone. In contrast, osteoblasts mediate osteoclastogenesis by expressing receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), which is expressed as a membrane-associated cytokine. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble RANKL decoy receptor that is predominantly produced by osteoblasts and which prevents osteoclast formation and osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting the RANKL-RANKL receptor interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review, we would like to summarize our experimental results on signal transduction that regulates the expression of RANKL and OPG. RESULTS: Using OPG gene-deficient mice, we have demonstrated that OPG and sclerostin produced by osteocytes play an important role in the maintenance of cortical and alveolar bone. In addition, it was shown that osteoclast-derived leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) reduces the expression of sclerostin in osteocytes and promotes bone formation. WP9QY (W9) is a peptide that was designed to be structurally similar to one of the cysteine-rich TNF-receptortype-I domains. Addition of the W9 peptide to bone marrow culture simultaneously inhibited osteoclast differentiation and stimulated osteoblastic cell proliferation. An anti-sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) antibody inhibited multinucleated osteoclast formation induced by RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Pit-forming activity of osteoclasts was also inhibited by the anti-Siglec-15 antibody. In addition, anti-Siglec-15 antibody treatment stimulated the appearance of osteoblasts in cultures of mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF.

Comprehensive molecular testing revealed the partner genes and features of these fusions in all the tested patients, and detected various recurring myeloid related gene mutations in eight patients. In two patients, RUNX1 mutations were identified. Most of these fusions were detected in patients with high-grade MDS and AML with a relatively short survival. Integration of conventional chromosome analysis, FISH testing and molecular genetic studies allow a comprehensive characterization of these rare RUNX1 fusions.

In this work, ultra-small platinum nanoparticles deposited on gold nanorods (Au@Pt) were synthesized and applied on the CML cells. It was shown that Au@Pt had multienzyme-like activities that induced a fluctuation of the intracellular ROS level over the incubation time, depending on their temporal locations in the cells. The ROS fluctuation triggered cellular autophagy and enhanced the level of autophagic protein Beclin-1, which caused the degradation of fusion protein BCR-ABL, the key factor of retarded differentiation and led to the downregulation of phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. These interactions together broke retarded differentiation and drove the CML cells to differentiate towards megakaryocytes, which is of great significance in enhancing leukemic cell apoptosis.

Analyzing the incidence of early death would prove beneficial as no much substantial information is available pertaining to the rural population. The present study analyzed the incidence of APL-associated early death, its clinical characteristics, and outcome among acute myeloid leukemia patients. Methods: This retrospective study included patients catering to the rural areas of Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh, India) from January 2013 to June 2017. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent sample median test, and Kaplan-Meier test for probability of survival were used. Results: Of the 204 acute myeloid cases, 24% cases (median age = 30 years; range=8 to 68 years) were identified as APL. Early death rate was 34.6%, who expired within 30 days from diagnosis with 65% suffering high disease risk. The median time from admission to death was 2 days (range 0-18). Cause of early death was majorly due to hemorrhage (64%). Moreover, 47.1% of early death patients received no prior antileukemic treatment. The overall 5-year cumulative disease-free survival rate among patients with APL was 76% where high disease risk patients had the least disease-free survival (65%-75%), whereas intermediate and low-risk patients had >80% and 100% disease-free survival rate, respectively. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and timely intervention might help to prevent early death as our findings clearly indicate poor awareness of disease and lack of early intervention among the rural population.",,"['Golamari, Krishna Reddy', 'Mikkilineni, Anupama', 'Chappidi, Sitalatha']","['Golamari KR', 'Mikkilineni A', 'Chappidi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Manipal Hospitals, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal Hospitals, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Manipal Hospitals, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rural Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['None'],2020/10/21 06:00,2021/06/30 06:00,['2020/10/20 08:37'],"['2020/10/20 08:37 [entrez]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2020_57_4_451_295071 [pii]', '10.4103/ijc.IJC_177_19 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2020 Oct-Dec;57(4):451-456. doi: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_177_19.,451-456,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'India', 'early death', 'hemorrhage', 'rural']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first case was a 67-year-old woman who developed bilateral vitreous opacity about half a year after the onset of acute type of ATLL that had been unresponsive to chemotherapy. She underwent vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery in both eyes. She had bilateral optic disc atrophy and localized retinal white infiltrates in both eyes. Cytological examination of vitreous aspirates demonstrated medium-sized cells with aberrant flower-like convoluted nuclei, positive for CD3, and thus indicative of T-cells. The second case was a 38-year-old man who was diagnosed acute type of ATLL at the presentation of acute kidney injury. About half a year after initial chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, he developed aqueous hypopyon in the right eye, concurrent with cutaneous and central nervous system relapse. Aqueous tap disclosed class V abnormal cells. The aqueous ""pseudohypopyon"" resolved in response to another round of chemotherapy with mogamulizumab. In review of 18 patients, intraocular infiltration with ATLL was diagnosed by vitrectomy in 9, aqueous tap in 3, chorioretinal biopsy in 3, and autopsy in 3. The intraocular infiltration developed concurrently with systemic diagnosis of ATLL in 5 patients, but developed later after chemotherapy in 13. In conclusion, intraocular infiltration with ATLL appears rare, and pathological diagnosis by vitrectomy and aqueous tap would help determine therapeutic plan in relapse after chemotherapy.",,"['Matsuo, Toshihiko', 'Shimizu, Takehiro', 'Tanaka, Takehiro', 'Yamamoto, Akira', 'Takasuka, Hiroki']","['Matsuo T', 'Shimizu T', 'Tanaka T', 'Yamamoto A', 'Takasuka H']","['Okayama University Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering in Health Systems, Okayama City, Japan.', 'Ophthalmology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama City, Japan.', 'Ophthalmology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama City, Japan.', 'Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama City, Japan.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Okayama Unversity Hospital, Okayama City, Japan.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Okayama Unversity Hospital, Okayama City, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,101624758,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autopsy', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Retina/pathology', 'Vitrectomy', 'Vitreous Body/pathology']",PMC7594223,,2020/10/21 06:00,2021/08/14 06:00,['2020/10/20 08:37'],"['2020/10/20 08:37 [entrez]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/2324709620966843 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep. 2020 Jan-Dec;8:2324709620966843. doi: 10.1177/2324709620966843.,2324709620966843,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6570-0030'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Japanese', '*adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*aqueous hypopyon', '*aqueous tap', '*cytology', '*immunostaining', '*literature review', '*pathology', '*vitrectomy', '*vitreous opacity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to focus on a systematic evaluation of renal biopsies in patients with MPNs or MDS/MPNs. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cohort comprised 29 patients (23 men) aged 67 +/- 11 years (mean +/- standard deviation), diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia (n = 5), polycythaemia vera (n = 9), primary myelofibrosis (n = 5), essential thrombocythaemia (n = 2), or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 4), as well as MPNs or MDS/MPNs not otherwise specified (n = 4). Patients manifested with proteinuria (93%), partially in the nephrotic range (46%), haematuria (72%), and impaired kidney function (93%). The most prominent histological findings included double-contoured glomerular basement membranes (71%), acute endothelial damage (68%), intracapillary platelet aggregation (62%), mesangiolysis (21%), thrombotic microangiopathy (24%), segmental glomerulosclerosis (66%), mesangial hypercellularity and sclerosis, extramedullary haematopoiesis (17%), and also IgA nephropathy (21%) and glomerulonephritis (GN) with features of infection-related GN (21%). MPN and MDS/MPN patients showed significantly more chronic changes than age-matched and sex-matched controls, including global and segmental glomerulosclerosis, mesangial sclerosis, and hypercellularity, whereas the extent of arteriosclerosis was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: MPN and MDS/MPN patients show glomerular scarring that exceeds age-related phenomena. Ongoing endothelial damage, growth factors released by platelets and deposition of immune complexes are probably the causative mechanisms. Early recognition of renal failure heralded by proteinuria and haematuria, and consequent control of risk factors for kidney failure, should be recommended for MPN and MDS/MPN patients.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Drug development was investigated using data obtained from https://www.clinicaltrials.gov and other publicly available databases. Drug compounds were excluded if they began phase I testing for the indication of interest before January 1999, if they were not industry sponsored, or if they treated secondary complications of the disease. Further analysis was conducted on biomarker usage, drug mechanisms of action, and line of treatment. Drugs were identified following our inclusion criteria for ALL (72), CLL (106), AML (159), and CML (47). The likelihood (cumulative pass rate), a drug would pass all phases of clinical testing and obtain Food and Drug Administration approval, was 18% (ALL), 10% (CLL), 7% (AML), and 12% (CML). Biomarker targeted therapies improved the success rates by three- and sevenfold, for ALL and AML, respectively. Enzyme inhibitors doubled the cumulative success rate for AML. First-line therapy and kinase inhibitors both independently doubled the cumulative success rate for CLL.

Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs fail to eliminate LSCs. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies eliminating LSCs are urgently needed. Our results showed that low-dose Triptolide (TPL) enhanced the anti-AML activity of Idarubicin (IDA) in vitro against LSC-like cells (CD34 + CD38- KG1alphaand CD34 + CD38- kasumi-1 cells) and CD34+ primary AML cells, while sparing normal cells. Inspiringly, the combination treatment with low-dose TPL and IDA was also effective against CD34 + blasts from AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation, which is an unfavorable risk factor for AML patients. Moreover, the combination of TPL and IDA induced a remarkable suppression of human leukemia growth in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, the enhanced effect of low dose TPL on IDA against LSCs was attributed to inhibiting DNA damage repair response. Thus, our study may provide a theoretical basis to facilitate the development of a novel LSCs-targeting strategy for AML.Graphical abstract.",,"['Shi, Pengcheng', 'Zha, Jie', 'Feng, Juan', 'Jiang, Zhiwu', 'Zhao, Haijun', 'Deng, Manman', 'Liao, Naying', 'Li, Peng', 'Jiang, Yirong', 'Song, Haihan', 'Xu, Bing']","['Shi P', 'Zha J', 'Feng J', 'Jiang Z', 'Zhao H', 'Deng M', 'Liao N', 'Li P', 'Jiang Y', 'Song H', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, No.55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, No.55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, People's Republic of China."", 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, No.55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, No.55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Dongguan People's Hospital, Southern Medical University (Dongguan People's Hospital), Dongguan, 523059, People's Republic of China. dgjyr0769@163.com."", 'Department of Immunology, DICAT Biomedical Computation Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada. haihansong@126.com.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, No.55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, People's Republic of China. xubingzhangjian@126.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,,IM,,,,2020/10/21 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/10/20 06:26'],"['2020/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/20 06:26 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-020-10054-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-020-10054-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2021 Apr;17(2):616-627. doi: 10.1007/s12015-020-10054-1.

All these populations arose from a common African Black ancestor but different clades have different admixture with archaic hominins including Neanderthals, Denisovans and Homo erectus, which may explain different CLL incidences. There are also some differences in clinical laboratory and molecular co-variates of CLL between these populations. Because the true age-adjusted incidence rate in African Blacks is unknown it is not possible to determine whether modern Europeans acquired susceptibility to CLL or the other populations lost susceptibility and/or developed resistance to developing CLL.

The molecular mechanisms of SDS are not fully understood. We report that primitive hematopoietic cells from SDS patients present with a reduced activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 and concomitantly a reduced frequency of HSCs polar for polarity proteins. The level of apolarity of SDS HSCs correlated with the magnitude of HSC depletion in SDS patients. Importantly, exogenously provided Wnt5a or GDF11 that elevates the activity of Cdc42 restored polarity in SDS HSCs and increased the number of HSCs in SDS patient samples in surrogate ex vivo assays. Single cell level RNA-Seq analyses of SDS HSCs and daughter cells demonstrated that SDS HSC treated with GDF11 are transcriptionally more similar to control than to SDS HSCs. Treatment with GDF11 reverted pathways in SDS HSCs associated with rRNA processing and ribosome function, but also viral infection and immune function, p53-dependent DNA damage, spindle checkpoints, and metabolism, further implying a role of these pathways in HSC failure in SDS. Our data suggest that HSC failure in SDS is driven at least in part by low Cdc42 activity in SDS HSCs.

Traditional models hold that HSPCs guard homeostatic function and adapt to regenerative demand by integrating cell-autonomous, intrinsic programs with extrinsic cues from the niche. Despite the biologic significance, little is known about the active roles HSPCs partake in reciprocally shaping the function of their microenvironment. Here, we review evidence of signals emerging from HSPCs through secreted autocrine or paracrine factors, including extracellular vesicles, and via direct contact within the niche. We also discuss the functional impact of direct cellular interactions between hematopoietic elements on niche occupancy in the context of leukemic infiltration. The aggregate data support a model whereby HSPCs are active participants in the dynamic adaptation of the stem cell niche unit during development and homeostasis, and under inflammatory stress, malignancy, or transplantation.",,"['Hurwitz, Stephanie N', 'Jung, Seul K', 'Kurre, Peter']","['Hurwitz SN', 'Jung SK', 'Kurre P']","[""Comprehensive Bone Marrow Failure Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Comprehensive Bone Marrow Failure Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Comprehensive Bone Marrow Failure Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. kurrep@email.chop.edu."", 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. kurrep@email.chop.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Extracellular Vesicles/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology']",,,2020/10/21 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/10/20 06:21'],"['2020/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/20 06:21 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01062-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01062-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3136-3148. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01062-8.

NPM1 mutations are always heterozygous. In addition, NPM1 has a number of different splice variants with the major variant encoded by exons 1-9 and 11-12 (NPM1.1). Further variants include NPM1.2 which lacks exons 8 and 10 and NPM1.3 which comprises exons 1-10 (and so lacks the region of sequence mutated in AML). In this study we quantified the expression of these three variants in 108 AML patient samples with and without NPM1 mutations and also assessed the level of expression from the wild-type and mutant alleles in variants NPM1.1 and NPM1.2. The results show that NPM1.1 is the most commonly expressed variant, however transcripts from wild-type and mutated alleles do not occur at equal levels, with a significant bias toward the mutated allele. Considering the involvement of mutant nucleophosmin in the progression and maintenance of AML, a bias towards mutated transcripts could have a significant impact on disease maintenance.",,"['Bailey, G D', 'Doolan, L', 'Baskar, A', 'Smith, L C', 'Seedhouse, C H']","['Bailey GD', 'Doolan L', 'Baskar A', 'Smith LC', 'Seedhouse CH']","['Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.', 'Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.', 'Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.', 'Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.', 'Blood Cancer and Stem Cells, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham Biodiscovery Institute, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.

MicroRNA-143 (miR-143) has been found to suppress autophagy, however, it is not clear whether miR-143 augments cytarabine cytotoxicity in AML.

Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-143 further decreases cell viability in cytarabine-treated AML cells. By contrast, miR-143 knockdown inhibits cytarabine-induced cytotoxicity, together indicating a role of miR-143 in enhancing cytarabine sensitivity in AML. Subsequently, we show that miR-143 inhibits autophagy in cytarabine-treated AML cells by directly targeting autophagy-related proteins (ATG), ATG7 and ATG2B, two critical known components of autophagic machinery. More importantly, autophagy reconstructed via co-expression of ATG7 and ATG2B substantially attenuates miR-143-enhanced cytotoxicity, which is associated with suppression of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeting ATG7 and ATG2B-dependent autophagy is a critical mechanism by which miR-143 sensitizes AML to cytarabine, implicating it as a potential therapeutic target in AML treatment.",,"['Zhang, Hao', 'Kang, Jianmin', 'Liu, Ling', 'Chen, Lulu', 'Ren, Saisai', 'Tao, Yanling']","['Zhang H', 'Kang J', 'Liu L', 'Chen L', 'Ren S', 'Tao Y']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China.', 'Graduate School, Jining Medical University, Jining 272000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272029, Shandong Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['0 (ATG2B protein, human)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (MIRN143 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7655171,,2020/10/21 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/10/20 06:17'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/20 06:17 [entrez]']","['103614 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.103614 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Oct 19;12(20):20111-20126. doi: 10.18632/aging.103614.

In this study, we report that the antiproliferative activity of a prototype anti-CD98 Ab, UM7F8, is due to Ab-induced membrane-associated ring CH (MARCH) E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination and downregulation of cell surface CD98. MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination of CD98 is required for UM7F8's capacity to reduce CD98 surface expression and its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of murine T cells. Similarly, CD98 ubiquitination is required for UM7F8's capacity to block the colony-forming ability of murine leukemia-initiating cells. To test the potential generality of the paradigm that MARCH E3 ligases can mediate the antiproliferative response to antitumor Abs, we examined the potential effects of MARCH proteins on responses to emibetuzumab, an anti-MET Ab currently in clinical trials for various cancers. We report that MET surface expression is reduced by MARCH1, 4, or 8-mediated ubiquitination and that emibetuzumab-induced MET ubiquitination contributes to its capacity to downregulate MET and inhibit human tumor cell proliferation. Thus, MARCH E3 ligases can act as cofactors for antitumor Abs that target cell surface proteins, suggesting that the MARCH protein repertoire of cells is a determinant of their response to such Abs.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Ablack, Jailal N', 'Ortiz, Jesus', 'Bajaj, Jeevisha', 'Trinh, Kathleen', 'Lagarrigue, Frederic', 'Cantor, Joseph M', 'Reya, Tannishtha', 'Ginsberg, Mark H']","['Ablack JN', 'Ortiz J', 'Bajaj J', 'Trinh K', 'Lagarrigue F', 'Cantor JM', 'Reya T', 'Ginsberg MH']","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093; and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093; and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093; and mhginsberg@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Heavy Chain)', '0 (Slc3A2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'MO4K3GDN1I (emibetuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Heavy Chain/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/immunology']",,,2020/10/21 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/10/20 06:17'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/20 06:17 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1901245 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1901245 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Nov 15;205(10):2883-2892. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1901245.

Although such findings suggested that HRG may be one of the most useful drugs for sepsis, obtaining a stable experimental system to standardize the HRG drug product is difficult to achieve using neutrophils isolated from volunteers. This is due to the short survival time and individual differences of human neutrophils. In the present study, we determined whether the differentiated neutrophil-like cell lines exhibited similar responses to HRG compared with human purified neutrophils. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was employed to induce the differentiation of the human myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and NB-4. Thereafter, the cells were treated with Hank's balanced salt solution, human serum albumin, or HRG. The effects of HRG on these cells were evaluated according to cell shape, microcapillary passage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, the expression of activated CD11b, and cell viability. HRG maintained the round shape of differentiated neutrophil-like cells, decreased the time required by cells to pass through the microcapillaries, and inhibited ROS production, NETs formation, and the expression of activated CD11b on the cell surface. Moreover, the cells could survive longer in the presence of HRG than the control. The ATRA-induced differentiated cell lines could be used as alternatives to neutrophils to investigate the effects of HRG on neutrophils. This method can thus be used as an essential standardization test in pharmaceutical development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Human neutrophils exhibit varying responses to histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG); however, all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiated neutrophil-like cell lines can be used as reliably proxies to investigate the effects of HRG on neutrophils. Additionally, these cell lines can be employed in the development of therapies for the treatment of sepsis.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Yoshii, Yukinori', 'Wake, Hidenori', 'Nishimura, Yoshito', 'Teshigawara, Kiyoshi', 'Wang, Dengli', 'Nishibori, Masahiro']","['Yoshii Y', 'Wake H', 'Nishimura Y', 'Teshigawara K', 'Wang D', 'Nishibori M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan mbori@md.okayama-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (histidine-rich proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Extracellular Traps/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Proteins/*pharmacology']",,,2020/10/21 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/20 06:16'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/20 06:16 [entrez]']","['jpet.120.000182 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.120.000182 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2020 Dec;375(3):406-413. doi: 10.1124/jpet.120.000182.

METHODS: We performed a three-state Markov analysis: stable disease (first line complete response [CR]), disease event (relapse, second line response and CR) and death. The modified IC-APL protocol is composed of three phases: induction, consolidation and maintenance. Cost and outcomes were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs); quality-adjusted life-years were used to calculate incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). RESULTS: The CR was achieved in 18 patients (90%), treated with the IC-APL protocol as the first-line option; one patient (5%) died in induction, another one never achieved CR (5%); of the 18 patients that achieved CR, 1 relapsed (5.5%). The median treatment cost of the IC-APL protocol was $21,523 USD. The average life-year in our study was 7.8 years, while the average quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 6.1 years. When comparing the ICER between the IC-APL and the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) protocols, we found the different costs of $6497, $19,133 and $17,123 USD in Italy, the USA and Canada, respectively. In relation to the ICUR, we found the different costs to be $13,955 and $11,979 USD in the USA and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the similar response rates, lower cost and easy access to the modified IC-APL regimen, we consider it a cost-effective and cost-utility protocol, deeming it the treatment of choice for our population.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

In younger patients, internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) is a common mutation for which two inhibitors (midostaurin and gilteritinib) with varied potency and specificity for FLT3 are clinically approved. However, the high rate of relapse or failed initial response of AML patients suggests that the addition of a second targeted therapy may be necessary to improve efficacy. Using an unbiased large-scale CRISPR screen, we genetically identified BCL2 knockout as having synergistic effects with an approved FLT3 inhibitor.

The antioxidant activity of Maca crude extract (MCE), total macamides (TMM) and total macaenes (TME) was evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS radical scavenging and reducing power. The ability of MCE, TMM and TME against multiple cancer cell lines (leukemia HL-60, lung cancer A549, liver cancer SMMC-7721, breast cancer MCF-7, and colon cancer SW480) was used to evaluate their anticancer activity. The results demonstrate that TMM has the best free radical scavenging ability and reducing power compared to MCE, TME, and TMM, TME has the weakest antioxidant capacity compared to them. The difference in antioxidant properties between TMM and TME may be caused by benzylated alkamide in the chemical structure. TMM also has a good inhibitory effect on the five cancer cells. N-benzyl-(9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-octadecatrienamide (NBot) is the most cytotoxicity inhibitory of the macamides tested. The inhibitory effect of N-benzyl-9Z, 12Z-octadecadienamide (NBod) on colon cancer SW480 is near that of control group, while the inhibitory rates of NBot on leukemia HL-60, lung cancer A549, liver cancer SMMC-7721, and breast cancer MCF-7 are near those of the control group.

Subsequently, based on conservation of amino acid residues, stability analysis, posttranscriptional modifications, and solvent accessibility analysis, the possible structural-functional relationship was established for high-confidence nsSNPs. Furthermore, based on the modeling results, some dissimilarities of mutant type amino acids from wild-type amino acids such as size, charge, interaction and hydrophobicity were revealed.

This property, called the FLASH effect, has caused enthusiasm in the radiation oncology community because it opens opportunities for safe dose escalation and improved radiation therapy outcome. Here, we investigated the impact of ultra-high-dose-rate FLASH versus conventional-dose-rate (CONV) total body irradiation (TBI) on humanized models of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and normal human hematopoiesis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We optimized the geometry of irradiation to ensure reproducible and homogeneous procedures using eRT6/Oriatron. Three T-ALL patient-derived xenografts and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and CD34(+) cells isolated from umbilical cord blood were transplanted into immunocompromised mice, together or separately. After reconstitution, mice received 4 Gy FLASH and CONV-TBI, and tumor growth and normal hematopoiesis were studied. A retrospective study of clinical and gene-profiling data previously obtained on the 3 T-ALL patient-derived xenografts was performed. RESULTS: FLASH-TBI was more efficient than CONV-TBI in controlling the propagation of 2 cases of T-ALL, whereas the third case of T-ALL was more responsive to CONV-TBI. The 2 FLASH-sensitive cases of T-ALL had similar genetic abnormalities, and a putative susceptibility imprint to FLASH-RT was found. In addition, FLASH-TBI was able to preserve some HSPC/CD34(+) cell potential. Interestingly, when HSPC and T-ALL were present in the same animals, FLASH-TBI could control tumor development in most (3 of 4) of the secondary grafted animals, whereas among the mice receiving CONV-TBI, treated cells died with high leukemia infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CONV-TBI, FLASH-TBI reduced functional damage to human blood stem cells and had a therapeutic effect on human T-ALL with a common genetic and genomic profile. The validity of the defined susceptibility imprint needs to be investigated further; however, to our knowledge, the present findings are the first to show benefits of FLASH-TBI on human hematopoiesis and leukemia treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Clinical activity has been demonstrated in relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thirty-three elderly patients with AML (median age, 75 years) received 120 mg tosedostat orally once daily combined with subcutaneous low-dose cytarabine (20 mg twice per day for 10 days, up to 8 cycles), until disease progression. Induction mortality was 12%. According to an intention-to-treat analysis, the complete remission (CR) rate was 48.5%, and thus the primary end point of the study was reached (expected CR, 25%). The partial remission rate was 6.1%, with an overall response rate of 54.5%. Furthermore, 4 of 33 patients had stable disease (median: 286 days). The median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 203 days and 222 days, respectively. Responding patients had a longer median OS than nonresponding patients (P = .001). A microarray analysis performed in 29 of 33 patients identified 188 genes associated with clinical response (CR vs no CR). Three of them (CD93, GORASP1, CXCL16) were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which correctly classified 83% of the patients. Specifically, CR achievement was efficiently predicted by the gene expression patterns, with an overall accuracy exceeding 90%. Finally, a negative predictive value of 100% was validated in an independent series, thus representing the first molecular predictor for clinical response to a specific combination drug treatment for AML.

We generated mice that express a human lymphoma-derived, hyperactive RANKK240E variant in B lymphocytes in vivo. Forced RANK signaling disrupted B cell tolerance and induced a fully penetrant systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease in addition to the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Importantly, RANKK240E transgenic CLL cells as well as CLL cells of independent murine and of human origin depend on microenvironmental RANK ligand (RANKL) for tumor cell survival. Consequently, inhibition of the RANKL-RANK axis with anti-RANKL antibodies killed murine and human CLL cells in vitro and in vivo. These results establish pathological B cell-intrinsic RANK signaling as a potential driver of autoimmunity and B cell malignancy, and they suggest the exploitation of clinically available anti-RANKL compounds for CLL treatment.",['(c) 2020 Alankus et al.'],"['Alankus, Begum', 'Ecker, Veronika', 'Vahl, Nathalie', 'Braun, Martina', 'Weichert, Wilko', 'Macher-Goppinger, Stephan', 'Gehring, Torben', 'Neumayer, Tanja', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Buchner, Maike', 'Ruland, Jurgen']","['Alankus B', 'Ecker V', 'Vahl N', 'Braun M', 'Weichert W', 'Macher-Goppinger S', 'Gehring T', 'Neumayer T', 'Zenz T', 'Buchner M', 'Ruland J']","['Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'TranslaTUM, Center for Translational Cancer Research, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'TranslaTUM, Center for Translational Cancer Research, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'TranslaTUM, Center for Translational Cancer Research, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'TranslaTUM, Center for Translational Cancer Research, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'TranslaTUM, Center for Translational Cancer Research, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'TranslaTUM, Center for Translational Cancer Research, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",PMC7868734,"['Disclosures: W.

A series of organometallic Pd(ii) complexes with a general formula of [Pd{kappa2(C,C)-[(C6H4-2)PPh2]CH(CO)C6H4Ph-4}{kappa2(N,O)}] (N,O = alanine (Pd-A), valine (Pd-V), leucine (Pd-L), l-isoleucine (Pd-I) and phenylalanine (Pd-F)) were prepared by cyclopalladation of the phosphorus ylide, bridge cleavage reaction and subsequent chelation of natural alpha-amino acids. The complexes were fully identified using IR and multinuclear 1H, 13C, 31P NMR spectroscopic methods. X-ray crystallography exhibited that the Pd(ii) atom is located in a slightly distorted square-planar environment surrounded by C,C-orthometallated phosphorus ylide as well as NO-pendant amino acid functionality. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of new cyclometallated Pd(ii) complexes toward a human leukemia (K562) cancer cell line indicated promising results. The highest cytotoxic activity was discovered in the case of phenylalanine (CH2C6H5). IC50 values of this complex on a panel of human tumor cell lines representative of liver (HepG2), breast (SKBR-3), and ovarian (A2780-Resistance/Sensitive) cancers also indicated promising antitumor effects in comparison with standard cisplatin. The binding interaction ability of the phenylalanine-containing orthopalladated complex, as the most efficient compound, with calf-thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (CT-DNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated. UV-Vis spectroscopy, competitive emission titration, and circular dichroism (CD) techniques demonstrated the intercalative binding of the Pd(ii) complex with DNA. Molecular docking studies also fully agreed with the experimental data. Examination of the reactivity towards the protein BSA revealed that the static quenching mechanism of BSA intrinsic fluorescence by the Pd(ii) complex with a binding constant (Kb) of approximately 105 is indicative of the high affinity of the complex. The competitive binding experiment using site markers with definite binding sites demonstrated that the hydrophobic cavities of site I (subdomain IIA) are responsible for the bimolecular interaction between protein BSA and the complex. Molecular docking studies effectively confirmed the significance of hydrophobic interactions in Pd(ii)-BSA binding.

Recently, JMJD1C has been associated with gemcitabine/carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia in non-small-cell lung cancer patients, making it a candidate marker for predicting the risk of toxicity. This study investigates if JMJD1C knockdown affects gemcitabine/carboplatin-sensitivity in cell lines. METHODS: Lentiviral transduction-mediated shRNA knockdown of JMJD1C in the cell lines K562 and MEG-01 were performed using shRNA#32 and shRNA#33. The knockdown was evaluated using qPCR. Cell proliferation, viability, and gemcitabine/carboplatin-sensitivity were subsequently determined using cell counts, trypan blue, and the MTT assay. RESULTS: ShRNA#33 resulted in JMJD1C downregulation by 56.24% in K562 and 68.10% in MEG-01. Despite incomplete knockdown, proliferation (reduction of cell numbers by 61-68%, day 7 post-transduction) and viability (reduction by 21-53%, day 7 post-transduction) were impaired in K562 and MEG-01 cells. Moreover, JMJD1C knockdown reduced the gemcitabine IC50-value for K562 cells (P < 0.01) and MEG-01 cells (P < 0.05) compared to scrambled shRNA control transduced cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that JMJD1C is essential for proliferation, survival, and viability of K562 and MEG-01 cells. Further, JMJD1C also potentially affects the cells gemcitabine/carboplatin-sensitivity. Although further research is required, the findings show that JMJD1C could have an influential role for gemcitabine/carboplatin-sensitivity.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Children with ETV6-RUNX1 or hyperdiploid > 50 ALL who achieve negative minimal residual disease during early remission induction are suitable candidates for reduction in treatment.

There are other fusions or mutations that may serve as putative targets, but effective targeted therapy has yet to be established. For other high-risk patients or poor early treatment responders who do not have targetable genetic lesions, current approaches that offer hope include blinatumomab, inotuzumab and CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL, and daratumumab and nelarabine for T-ALL.

SIK inhibition augmented the ability of ATRA to induce growth inhibition and G1 cell cycle arrest of AML cells. Moreover, combining ATRA and SIK inhibition synergistically activated the Akt signaling pathway but not the MAPK pathway. Pharmacological blockade of Akt activity suppressed the combination-induced differentiation, indicating an essential role for Akt in the action of the combination treatment.

The recent availability of targeted next generation sequencing (t-NGS) and its combination with RBC deformability measured with a laser-assisted optical rotational ektacytometer (LoRRca) has demonstrated to be the most powerful contribution to lower the percentage of hereditary hemolytic anemia undiagnosed cases.

The rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) through formula feeding, although significantly lower than through breastfeeding, is approximately 2.4%-3.6%, suggesting the possibility of alternative transmission routes. MTCT of HTLV-1 might occur through the uterus, birth canal, or placental tissues; the latter is known as transplacental transmission. Here, we found that HTLV-1 proviral DNA was present in the placental villous tissues of the fetuses of nearly half of pregnant carriers and in a small number of cord blood samples. An RNA ISH assay showed that HTLV-1-expressing cells were present in nearly all subjects with HTLV-1-positive placental villous tissues, and their frequency was significantly higher in subjects with HTLV-1-positive cord blood samples. Furthermore, placental villous trophoblasts expressed HTLV-1 receptors and showed increased susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection. In addition, HTLV-1-infected trophoblasts expressed high levels of viral antigens and promoted the de novo infection of target T cells in a humanized mouse model. In summary, during pregnancy of HTLV-1 carriers, HTLV-1 was highly expressed in placental villous tissues, and villous trophoblasts showed high HTLV-1 sensitivity, suggesting that MTCT of HTLV-1 occurs through the placenta.",,"['Tezuka, Kenta', 'Fuchi, Naoki', 'Okuma, Kazu', 'Tsukiyama, Takashi', 'Miura, Shoko', 'Hasegawa, Yuri', 'Nagata, Ai', 'Komatsu, Nahoko', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Sasaki, Eita', 'Mizukami, Takuo', 'Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Matsuoka, Sahoko', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Miura, Kiyonori', 'Hamaguchi, Isao']","['Tezuka K', 'Fuchi N', 'Okuma K', 'Tsukiyama T', 'Miura S', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Nagata A', 'Komatsu N', 'Hasegawa H', 'Sasaki D', 'Sasaki E', 'Mizukami T', 'Kuramitsu M', 'Matsuoka S', 'Yanagihara K', 'Miura K', 'Hamaguchi I']","['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism/pathology/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Trophoblasts/*metabolism/pathology/virology']",PMC7598071,,2020/10/20 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/10/19 12:23'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/19 12:23 [entrez]']","['135525 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI135525 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2020 Nov 2;130(11):6171-6186. doi: 10.1172/JCI135525.,6171-6186,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epidemiology', '*Infectious disease', '*Virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of STC1 in the pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of differentiating macrophage, however, is not clear. In this study, our data showed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment induced human leukemia monocytic cells (ThP-1) differentiation to M0 macrophages. The differentiation was accompanied by a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of STC1, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha, and anti-inflammatory markers, CD163 & CD206. An intermitted removal of PMA treatment reduced the mRNA levels of STC1 and TNFalpha but had no noticeable effects on the anti-inflammatory markers. The correlation in the expression of STC1 and pro-inflammatory markers in differentiating macrophages was investigated, using siRNASTC1-transfected PMA-induced cells. Consistently, the transcripts levels of TNFalpha and IL-6 were significantly reduced. Moreover, LPS/IFNgamma-induced M1-polarization showed remarkably higher expression levels of STC1 than IL-4/IL-13-induced M2-macrophages and PMA-induced M0-macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis of siRNASTC1-transfected M1-polarized cells revealed an upregulation of TBC1 domain family member 3 (TBC1D3G). The gene regulates the payload of macrophage-released extracellular vesicles to mediate inflammation. The conditioned media from siRNASTC1-transfected M1-polarized cells were found to reduce Hep3B cell motility. The data suggest that the expression of STC1 were associated with macrophage differentiation, but preferentially to M1 polarization.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite improved therapeutic efficacy, the clinical response rate is still unsatisfactory as revealed by the fact that only a minority of patients experience durable benefits. Additionally, ""off-target"" effects after systemic administration remain challenging for ICB treatment. To this end, the local and targeted delivery of ICB agents instead could be a potential solution to maximize the therapeutic outcomes while minimizing the side effects.In this Account, our recent studies directed at the development of different strategies for the local and targeted delivery of ICB agents are discussed. For example, transdermal microneedle patches loaded with anti-programmed death-1 antibody (aPD1) and anti-CTLA4 were developed to facilitate sustained release of ICB agents at the diseased sites. Triggered release could also be achieved by various stimuli within the tumor microenvironment, including low pH and abnormally expressed enzymes. Recently, the combination of an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) loaded hollow-structured microneedle patch with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) therapy was also reported. Microneedles provided microchannels to facilitate the transdermal transport of CAP and further induce immunogenic tumor cell death, which could be synergized by the local release of aPD-L1. In addition, in situ formed injectable or sprayable hydrogels were tailored to deliver immunomodulatory antibodies to the surgical bed to inhibit tumor recurrence after primary tumor resection. In paralell, inspired by the unique targeting ability of platelets toward the inflammatory sites, we engineered natural platelets decorated with aPD-L1 for targeted delivery after tumor resection to inhibit tumor recurrence. We further constructed a cell-cell combination delivery platform based on conjugates of platelets and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for leukemia treatment. With the homing ability of HSCs to the bone marrow, the HSC-platelet-aPD1 assembly could effectively deliver aPD1 in an acute myeloid leukemia mouse model. Besides living cells, we also leveraged HEK293T-derived vesicles with PD1 receptors on their surfaces to disrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 immune inhibitory pathway. Moreover, the inner space of the vesicles allowed the packaging of an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor, further reinforcing the therapeutic efficacy. A similar approach has also been demonstrated by genetically engineering platelets overexpressing PD1 receptor for postsurgical treatment. We hope the local and targeted ICB agent delivery methods introduced in this collection would further inspire the development of advanced drug delivery strategies to improve the efficiency of cancer treatment while alleviating side effects.",,"['Han, Xiao', 'Li, Hongjun', 'Zhou, Daojia', 'Chen, Zhaowei', 'Gu, Zhen']","['Han X', 'Li H', 'Zhou D', 'Chen Z', 'Gu Z']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States.', 'Institute of Food Safety and Environment Monitoring, College of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, P.

We aimed at the characterization of HeH cases in pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients with special emphasis on the structural abnormalities including t-HeH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study included all patients diagnosed with HeH over the period from January 2016 to April 2019 presenting to the Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. RESULTS: Among 480 de novo B-ALL pediatric patients, HeH was detected in eighty (16.7%) cases with a median age of 5 years. t-HeH was identified in 17/480 (3.5%) cases: 9(1.9%) with t(12;21), 7(1.5%) with t(9;22), and 1(0.2%) with t(4;11). Duplication (1q) was the most prevalent structural abnormality in c-HeH (hyperdiploidy without recurrent translocations) (n = 12,15%). Children >/=10 years or presenting with white blood cells (WBC) >/=50 x 10(9) /L) had an inferior 3 year-overall survival as compared to younger children (P = .003), and to lower WBC (P = .02). Duplication (1q) was an independent adverse parameter on the disease-free survival (DFS) of c-HeH patients (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Older age and WBC >/= 50 x 10(9) /L were adverse prognostic factors.

The aim of the investigation was to probe the regulatory relevance of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) aspartyl-tRNA synthetase anti-sense 1 (DARS-AS1)/microRNA-425 (miR-425)/transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1) to the development of AML. METHODS: The DARS-AS1 expression in bone marrow tissues was first analyzed in healthy subjects and AML patients. Subsequently, AML cell lines with DARS-AS1 knockdown were constructed, followed by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Afterward, downstream miRNA of DARS-AS1 and target mRNA of the miRNA were analyzed by bioinformatics, and their binding relationships were verified. Functional rescue experiments were then implemented. Finally, activation of the Smad2/3 signaling in MV4-11 and BF-24 cells were detected by western blot. RESULTS: DARS-AS1 was overexpressed in bone marrow tissues of AML patients and cells, and DARS-AS1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation of AML cells and induced apoptosis. DARS-AS1 bound to and negatively correlated with miR-425. Further results suggested that TGFB1 might be a target gene of miR-425 and could promote Smad2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Finally, DARS-AS1 depletion could diminish the tumor volume in vivo. CONCLUSION: All in all, we highlighted here that DARS-AS1 enhanced the expression of TGFB1 through binding to miR-425 to modulate AML progression via the Smad2/3 pathway, which might perform as a therapeutic target for AML.",,"['Dou, Binghua', 'Jiang, Zhu', 'Chen, Xiaoguang', 'Wang, Chunmei', 'Wu, Jing', 'An, Jindou', 'Sheng, Guangyao']","['Dou B', 'Jiang Z', 'Chen X', 'Wang C', 'Wu J', 'An J', 'Sheng G']","[""Department of Paediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Ultrasound, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (MIRN425 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Smad2 Protein/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*genetics']",PMC7592321,,2020/10/20 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2020/10/19 08:39'],"['2020/10/19 08:39 [entrez]', '2020/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820965580 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820965580. doi: 10.1177/1533033820965580.,1533033820965580,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1756-5257'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*DARS-AS1', '*Smad2/3 signaling', '*TGFB1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*microRNA-425']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: AYA prescribed maintenance 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) received daily text message surveys and utilized an electronic pill bottle for 28 days. Text surveys assessed 6MP adherence and contextual associates (eg, mood). Feasibility was defined by recruitment/retention rates, survey completion rates, cost, and technical issues. After the 28-day period, AYA completed an acceptability survey. Secondary analyses compared text survey and electronic pill bottle adherence rates, and explored the daily associations between contextual factors and 6MP nonadherence. RESULTS: Eighteen AYA enrolled (M age = 18, range 15-22) and completed study procedures (100% recruitment and retention rates). Adherence survey completion rates were high (M = 88.9%), the technology cost was $204.00, and there were few technical issues. AYA reported high satisfaction with the surveys and perceived them as a helpful medication reminder. While not significantly correlated, survey and electronic pill bottle adherence data converged on the majority of days (>90%). Exploratory analyses showed that AYA were more likely to miss a dose of 6MP on weekends (OR = 2.33, P = .048) and on days when their adherence motivation (OR = 0.28, P = .047) and negative affect (OR = 3.92, P = .02) worsened from their own typical functioning. CONCLUSIONS: For AYA with leukemia, daily text-based surveys are a feasible and acceptable method for delivering medication adherence assessments, and may operate as a short-term intervention. To develop personalized mobile health interventions, findings also highlighted the need to study time-varying predictors of 6MP nonadherence.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Psihogios, Alexandra M', 'Li, Yimei', 'Ahmed, Annisa', 'Huang, Jing', 'Kersun, Leslie S', 'Schwartz, Lisa A', 'Barakat, Lamia P']","['Psihogios AM', 'Li Y', 'Ahmed A', 'Huang J', 'Kersun LS', 'Schwartz LA', 'Barakat LP']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['K08 CA241335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Motivation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Reminder Systems/*instrumentation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Text Messaging', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/10/20 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/10/19 06:04'],"['2020/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/19 06:04 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28767 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Feb;68(2):e28767. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28767.

We have found hypopigmentation in 49.2% of the cases and a statistically significant association with interferon (IFN) intake. Eyelid edema's frequency was 45.4%. Mean photo-exposure was 1.95 h/day and only 8.3% of the patients used sunscreen daily. 44.3% of the patients reported a lighter skin color with the treatment and a statistically significant relationship with conjunctival hemorrhage was also found. Concordance between patients and dermatologist was moderate (kappa index 0.41). We found xerosis (21.3%), eczematous eruptions (21.3%), melasma (4.9%) and other isolated skin problems (ie, granulomatous panniculitis) in up to 16.4% of cases. Appearance of hypopigmented macules is associated to vascular conjunctival fragility and these patients need a slightly longer time to reach a complete molecular response, but without additional changes in survival or relapse frequency. We have stablished a specific dermatologic diagnosis in all the cases and we have not found the previously published as maculopapular rashes. Hypopigmentation, the more frequent AE, was not perceived as a relevant side effect. Photosensitivity, in our cases, was not reported, although imatinib-treated patients avoided sun-exposure.

HbF-containing cells, namely F cells, are strongly influenced by genetic factors. We measured the percentage of F cells (Fcells%) in 222 patients with SCD to evaluate the association of (i) Fcells% with genetic HbF-modifier variants and (ii) Fcells% with haematological parameters. There was a different distribution of Fcells% in females compared to males. The association of the B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) locus with Fcells% (beta = 8.238; P < 0.001) and with HbF% (beta = 2.490; P < 0.001) was significant. All red cell parameters except for Hb and mean corpuscular Hb concentration levels in males and females were significantly different. The Fcells% was positively associated with mean cell Hb, mean cell volume and reticulocytes. To explain the significant gender difference in Fcells%, we tested for associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms on the X chromosomal region Xp22.2, where a genetic determinant of HbF had been previously hypothesised. We found in males a significant association with a SNP in FERM and PDZ domain-containing protein 4 (FRMPD4) and adjacent to male-specific lethal complex subunit 3 (MSL3).

In Mexico and other Hispanic populations, the incidence of this neoplasm is one of the highest reported worldwide. Functional polymorphisms of various enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics have been associated with an increased risk of developing ALL, and the risk is different by ethnicity. The aims of the present study were to identify whether NQO1, CYP2E1, and NAT2 polymorphisms or some genotype-environmental interactions were associated with ALL risk in Mexican children. Methods: We conducted a case-control study including 478 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL and 284 controls (children without leukemia). Ancestry composition of a subset of cases and controls was assessed using 32 ancestry informative markers. Genetic-environmental interactions for the exposure to hydrocarbons were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Results: The polymorphisms rs1801280 (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.21-1.93), rs1799929 (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.55-2.49), and rs1208 (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.14-1.81) were found to increase the risk of ALL; being the risks higher under a recessive model (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.30-1.71, OR 3.87, 95% CI 2.20-6.80, and OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.32-3.87, respectively). Gene-environment interaction analysis showed that NAT2 rs1799929 TT genotype confers high risk to ALL under exposure to fertilizers, insecticides, hydrocarbon derivatives, and parental tobacco smoking. No associations among NQO1, CYP2E1, and ALL were observed. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence for the association between NAT2 polymorphisms/gene-environment interactions, and the risk of childhood ALL in Mexican children.","['Copyright (c) 2020

Therefore, developments of novel targeted therapeutics are urgently needed for treatment of T-ALL. In this study, we found that mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a novel promising therapeutic target for treatment of T-ALL. MALT1 inhibitor MI-2 significantly suppressed the cell growth, proliferation, and colony formation of T-ALL cells. Furthermore, MI-2 induced cell apoptosis of T-ALL via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway. In a T-ALL mouse model, MI-2 significantly reduced leukemic burden and prolonged the survival of leukemia-bearing mice. Mechanistically, MALT1 inhibition effectively blocked both baseline and Notch1-induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB pathway, which mediates T-ALL cell survival. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential role of MALT1 as an attractive target for treatment of T-ALL and support the potential of MI-2 or other MALT1 inhibitors to clinical trials in T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Zhang, Xu, Zhang, Pan, Zhong, Zhang, Yin, Yao, Wu, Li,', 'Liu, Xu and Niu.']","['Wang, Rong', 'Zhang, Huihui', 'Xu, Jiawen', 'Zhang, Ninghan', 'Pan, Ting', 'Zhong, Xiaomin', 'Zhang, Huanxin', 'Yin, Lingling', 'Yao, Yao', 'Wu, Qingyun', 'Li, Zhenyu', 'Liu, Xuejiao', 'Xu, Kailin', 'Niu, Mingshan']","['Wang R', 'Zhang H', 'Xu J', 'Zhang N', 'Pan T', 'Zhong X', 'Zhang H', 'Yin L', 'Yao Y', 'Wu Q', 'Li Z', 'Liu X', 'Xu K', 'Niu M']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Insititute of Nervous System Diseases, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7538650,,2020/10/20 06:00,2020/10/20 06:01,['2020/10/19 05:58'],"['2020/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/19 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.558339 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 23;10:558339. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.558339. eCollection 2020.,558339,,20200923,['NOTNLM'],"['MALT1', 'MI-2', 'NF-kappaB', 'Notch1', 'T-ALL']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms involved in sunitinib resistance vary and need further investigation. We found long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colon cancer-associated transcript-1 (CCAT1) overexpressed in sunitinib-resistant cells while declined in the parental cells. Moreover, lncRNA CCAT1 increased significantly in samples with resistance to sunitinib compared with those with responses to sunitinib. The reduction of CCAT1 suppressed cell growth and colony formation while triggering apoptosis. Inversely, the ectopic expression of c-Myc reversed the inhibition of cell growth and enhancement of apoptosis by the knockdown of CCAT1. We also verified that anti-apoptosis protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) decreased along with the deregulation of CCAT1, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 restored in cells that were transfected sh-CCAT1 and c-Myc simultaneously. Apart from the in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that knockdown of CCAT1 boosted response to sunitinib by performing sunitinib-resistant ACHN mouse models. Briefly, lncRNA CCAT1 conferred renal cell carcinoma resistance to sunitinib in a c-Myc-dependent manner, providing a novel target for improvement of sunitinib therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Shan, Liu and Zhan.']","['Shan, Liping', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhan, Yunhong']","['Shan L', 'Liu W', 'Zhan Y']","['Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Emergency Department, First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7544819,,2020/10/20 06:00,2020/10/20 06:01,['2020/10/19 05:58'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/19 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.516552 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 25;10:516552. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.516552. eCollection 2020.,516552,,20200925,['NOTNLM'],"['CCAT1', 'apoptosis', 'renal cell carcinoma', 'resistance', 'sunitinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies highlighted the role of UPR in acute leukemias and UPR targeting has been suggested as a therapeutic approach. Aberrant Notch signaling is a common feature of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), as downregulation of Notch activity negatively affects T-ALL cell survival, leading to the employment of Notch inhibitors in T-ALL therapy. Here we demonstrate that Notch3 is able to sustain UPR in T-ALL cells, as Notch3 silencing favored a Bip-dependent IRE1alpha inactivation under ER stress conditions, leading to increased apoptosis via upregulation of the ER stress cell death mediator CHOP. By using Juglone, a naturally occurring naphthoquinone acting as an anticancer agent, to decrease Notch3 expression and induce ER stress, we observed an increased ER stress-associated apoptosis. Altogether our results suggest that Notch3 inhibition may prevent leukemia cells from engaging a functional UPR needed to compensate the Juglone-mediated ER proteotoxic stress. Notably, in vivo administration of Juglone to human T-ALL xenotransplant models significantly reduced tumor growth, finally fostering the exploitation of Juglone-dependent Notch3 inhibition to perturb the ER stress/UPR signaling in Notch3-dependent T-ALL subsets.",,"['Giuli, Maria Valeria', 'Diluvio, Giulia', 'Giuliani, Eugenia', 'Franciosa, Giulia', 'Di Magno, Laura', 'Pignataro, Maria Gemma', 'Tottone, Luca', 'Nicoletti, Carmine', 'Besharat, Zein Mersini', 'Peruzzi, Giovanna', 'Pelullo, Maria', 'Palermo, Rocco', 'Canettieri, Gianluca', 'Talora, Claudio', ""d'Amati, Giulia"", 'Bellavia, Diana', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Checquolo, Saula']","['Giuli MV', 'Diluvio G', 'Giuliani E', 'Franciosa G', 'Di Magno L', 'Pignataro MG', 'Tottone L', 'Nicoletti C', 'Besharat ZM', 'Peruzzi G', 'Pelullo M', 'Palermo R', 'Canettieri G', 'Talora C', ""d'Amati G"", 'Bellavia D', 'Screpanti I', 'Checquolo S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenaghen, Copenaghen, Denmark.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Unit of Histology and Medical Embryology, Department of Anatomy, Histology, Forensic Medicine and Orthopaedics, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Center for Life Nano Science@Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. diana.bellavia@uniroma1.it.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. isabella.screpanti@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnology, Sapienza University, Latina, Italy. saula.checquolo@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,PMC7569087,,2020/10/20 06:00,2020/10/20 06:01,['2020/10/19 05:52'],"['2020/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/19 05:52 [entrez]', '2020/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-020-00279-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-020-00279-7 [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2020 Oct 18;9(10):93. doi: 10.1038/s41389-020-00279-7.,93,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-9369', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5309-5558', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0317-9854', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-9107', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5728-2537', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8071-9098', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5109-8392']",20201018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High mortality rates of AML are caused by relapse and chemoresistance; therefore, we analyzed the role of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) splice variants A and B in AML progression and response to chemotherapy. The expression of P2X7RA and P2X7RB was investigated in samples obtained from MDS and AML untreated subjects or AML patients in relapse or remission after chemotherapy. Both P2X7RA and P2X7RB were overexpressed in AML versus MDS suggesting a disease-promoting function. However, in relapsing patients, P2X7RA was downmodulated, while P2X7RB was upmodulated. Treatment with daunorubicin (DNR), one of the main chemotherapeutics for AML, upregulated P2X7RB expression while reducing P2X7RA mRNA in AML blasts. Interestingly, DNR administration also caused ATP release from AML blasts suggesting that, following chemotherapy, activation of the receptor isoforms via their agonist will be responsible for the differential survival of blasts overexpressing P2X7RA versus P2X7RB. Indeed, AML blasts expressing high levels of P2X7RA were more prone to cell death if exposed to DNR, while those overexpressing P2X7RB were more vital and even protected against DNR toxicity. These data were reproducible also in HEK-293 cells separately expressing P2X7RA and B. P2X7RA facilitation of DNR toxicity was in part due to increased uptake of the drug inside the cell that was lost upon P2X7RB expression. Finally, in an AML xenograft model administration of DNR or the P2X7R antagonist, AZ10606120 significantly reduced leukemic growth and coadministration of the drugs proved more efficacious than single treatment as it reduced both P2X7RA and P2X7RB levels and downmodulated c-myc oncogene. Taken together, our data suggest P2X7RA and P2X7RB as potential prognostic markers for AML and P2X7RB as a therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in AML relapsing patients.",,"['Pegoraro, Anna', 'Orioli, Elisa', 'De Marchi, Elena', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Milani, Asia', 'Di Virgilio, Francesco', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Adinolfi, Elena']","['Pegoraro A', 'Orioli E', 'De Marchi E', 'Salvestrini V', 'Milani A', 'Di Virgilio F', 'Curti A', 'Adinolfi E']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44121, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital S.Orsola-Malpighi, Institute of Haematology ""L. and A.

The aim of this study was to establish and characterize an MTX-resistant tumor cell model in order to study the mechanism contributing to drug sensitivity loss in pALL. Parental CCRF-CEM cells were treated with a gradual increasing concentration of MTX from 5 nM to 1.28 muM. The resistant subline was then characterized according to the cellular morphology, cellular growth curves and specific mRNA expression changes associated with drug resistance in ALL. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were used to analyze cells relative responsiveness to a set of clinically used anti-ALL chemotherapy drugs. The morphological changes observed in the new R-CCRF-CEM/MVCD subline were associated with dysregulation of the EMT-related genes, Twist1 and CDH1. Cells demonstrated downregulation of ABCC1 and the overexpression of ABCA2, ABCA3, and ABCB1 membrane transporters. However, short treatment of the sensitive and parental cell line with MTX did not affect the expression profiles of the former ABC pumps. Moreover, R-CCRF-CEM/MVCD cells demonstrated cross-resistance to cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, ara-C), vincristine, and dexamethasone, but not doxorubicin. The induced cross-resistance to specific chemotherapy drugs may possibly be attributed to selective dysregulation of the ABC transporters and EMT-related genes.

METHODS: The expression of LIFR-AS1 and miR-4262 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-RCR) in both glioma tissues and cell lines. Colony formation assay, 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay were respectively conducted to detect cell clones, proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. The effect of LIFR-AS1 on the chemoresistance to temozolomide (TMZ) of glioma cells was also analyzed. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to evaluate the luciferase activity. The expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65, p-NF-kappaB p65 and inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) in glioma cells were measured by western blot. RESULTS: LIFR-AS1 was lowly expressed and miR-4262 was highly expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. LIFR-AS1 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis of glioma cells. LIFR-AS1 overexpression also reduced the chemoresistance to TMZ of glioma cells. Moreover, LIFR-AS1 overexpression suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway in glioma cells. miR-4262 was the target gene of LIFR-AS1. We also found that miR-4262 abrogated the functions of LIFR-AS1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of glioma cells in the NF-kappaB pathway.

In this study, we analyzed the outcome and prognostic factors for patients with precursor B cell ALL (n=405) diagnosed during a 10-year period (2005-2015) at our institution. Materials and Methods: All patients were treated with a uniform institutional regimen based on four risk groups, except for steroid type; patients diagnosed up till 2008 receiving dexamethasone, while subsequent patients received prednisolone. None of the patients received cranial irradiation in first complete remission. RESULTS: The 10-year EFS and overall survival was 76.3%+/-2.3% and 85.1%+/-1.9%. Ten-year cumulative incidence of relapse, any central nervous system (CNS) relapse and isolated CNS relapse was 20.8%+/-2.2%, 3.7%+/-1.1%, and 2.5%+/-0.9%, respectively. A comparison of established, good prognosis genetic abnormalities showed that patients with high hyperdiploidy had significantly better EFS than those with ETV6-RUNX1 rearrangement (10-year EFS of 91.2%+/-3.0% vs. 79.5%+/-4.4%, p=0.033). For the overall cohort, male sex, infant ALL, initial CNS involvement, and Philadelphia chromosome (+) ALL were significant factors for lower EFS in multivariate study, while high hyperdiploidy conferred favorable outcome.

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have greatly improved the prognosis of CML patients, the emergence of TKI resistance is an important clinical problem, which deserves additional treatment options based on unique biological properties to CML cells. In this study, we show that metabolic homeostasis is critical for survival of CML cells, especially when the disease is in advanced stages. The BCR-ABL protein activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for ATP production and the mTOR pathway to suppress autophagy. BCR-ABL is detected in the nuclei of advanced-stage CML cells, in which ATP is sufficiently supplied by enhanced glucose metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase is further activated under energy-deprived conditions and triggers autophagy through ULK1 phosphorylation and mTOR inhibition. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates 14-3-3 and Beclin 1 to facilitate cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear BCR-ABL in a BCR-ABL/14-3-3tau/Beclin1/XPO1 complex. Cytoplasmic BCR-ABL protein undergoes autophagic degradation when intracellular ATP is exhausted by disruption of the energy balance or forced autophagy flux with AMP mimetics, mTOR inhibitors, or arsenic trioxide, leading to apoptotic cell death. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic vulnerability that could be useful for treating TKI-resistant CML.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Indeed, registry data in elderly patients show that the median progression-free survival (mPFS) following first- and second-line therapies are only 6.7 and 3.1 months, respectively. The aim of the study is to show the activity of metronomic chemotherapy, a regular administration of low chemotherapeutic drug doses allowing a favourable toxicity profile, on elderly PTCL patients. METHODS: We report a series of 17 PTCL patients, treated with the all-oral metronomic schedule DEVEC (prednisolone-etoposide-vinorelbine-cyclophosphamide) in four Italian centres. Patients 5/17 (29.4%) were treatment-naive (naive) and 12/17 (70.6%) were relapsed-refractory (RR), respectively. The median age was 83 years (range 71-87) and 71.5 years (range 56-85) for naive and RR, respectively. In vitro activity of metronomic vinorelbine (VNR), etoposide (ETO) and their concomitant combination on HH, a PTCL cell line, was also assessed. RESULTS: Histology: PTCL-not-otherwise-specified = 12; angioimmunoblastic = 2; NK/T nasal type = 1; adult-type leukaemia lymphoma = 1, transformed Mycosis Fungoides = 1. The overall response rate was 80 and 58% in naive and RR, respectively; whereas the PFS was 20 in naive (95% CI 0-43) and 11 months (95% CI 4.2-17.8) in RR. The occurrence of relevant adverse events was 23.5%, which was managed with ETO dose reduction. In vitro experiments showed that both metronomic VNR and ETO caused a significant inhibitory activity on HH cells and a strong synergism when administered concomitantly. CONCLUSION: All-oral DEVEC showed an encouraging activity and acceptable toxicity. This schedule deserves further studies in elderly PTCL also for assessing combinations with targeted drugs.",,"['Cox, Maria Christina', 'Banchi, Marta', 'Pelliccia, Sabrina', 'Di Napoli, Arianna', 'Marcheselli, Luigi', 'Patti, Caterina', 'Anticoli Borza, Paola', 'Battistini, Roberta', 'Di Gregorio, Francesca', 'Orlandi, Paola', 'Bocci, Guido']","['Cox MC', 'Banchi M', 'Pelliccia S', 'Di Napoli A', 'Marcheselli L', 'Patti C', 'Anticoli Borza P', 'Battistini R', 'Di Gregorio F', 'Orlandi P', 'Bocci G']","[""Haematology Unit, AOS Sant'Andrea, Rome, Italy. chrisscox@gmail.com."", ""Haematology Department King's College Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK. chrisscox@gmail.com."", 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', ""Haematology Unit, AOS Sant'Andrea, Rome, Italy."", 'Pathology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Fondazione Italiana Linfomi, Alessandria, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Ospedale V.

In this study, the efficacy and toxicity of high-affinity inhibitors targeting antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins (BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1) were evaluated. By RNA sequencing analysis of a pan-cancer cohort comprising >1500 patients and subsequent prediction of protein activity, BCL-XL was identified as the only antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein that is overactivated in CRC. Consistently, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of BCL-XL induced apoptosis in human CRC cell lines. In a combined treatment approach, targeting BCL-XL augmented the efficacy of chemotherapy in vitro, in a murine CRC model, and in human ex vivo derived CRC tissue cultures. Collectively, these data show that targeting of BCL-XL is efficient and safe in preclinical CRC models, observations that pave the way for clinical translation.",,"['Scherr, Anna-Lena', 'Mock,

PATIENTS: HCT patients suffering from HSV-1 stomatitis without response after 1 week of high-dose acyclovir (ACV) were tested for ACV resistance. Patients with proven ACV resistance were treated either topically with cidofovir solution and gel or with topical foscavir cream or with intravenous foscavir. RESULTS: Among 214 consecutive HCT patients, 6 developed severe ACVr HSV-1 stomatitis (WHO grade III n = 1, WHO grade IV n = 5). All 6 patients suffered from relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after HCT. ACVr stomatitis was treated topically with first-line (n = 4) or second-line (n = 2) cidofovir. Topical foscavir cream was applied as first-line (n = 1) or second-line (n = 1) therapy. Intravenous foscavir was used in 3 patients (first-line therapy, n = 1; second-line therapy, n = 2). Complete remission was reached by topical cidofovir (n = 3), topical foscavir (n = 1), and intravenous foscavir (n = 1), respectively. Five of the 6 patients died due to progression of leukemia. Only 1 patient survived. CONCLUSIONS: ACVr HSV-1 stomatitis is a severe complication in AML patients relapsing after HCT. It reflects the seriously impaired general condition of these patients.

METHODS: We used a series of bioinformatics methods to comprehensively analyze the relationship between PDCD1 gene and prognosis, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune cell infiltration of various cancers from the existing public database, and try to find the potential prognostic value of PDCD1 for in pan-cancer. RESULTS: High expression of PDCD1 was closely related to better overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in breast invasive carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma; have a better disease-free interval (DFI) and progression-free interval (PFI) in several cancer types. Meanwhile, the high level of PDCD1 gene expression was associated with poorer OS, DSS, and PFI in brain lower grade glioma and uveal melanoma; poorer OS in acute myeloid leukemia and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma; poorer OS and DSS in glioblastoma multiforme; poorer DSS in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, by Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analysis. PDCD1 gene expression was significantly correlated with TMB and MSI in 14 and 12 cancer types, respectively, and infiltrating levels of immune cells, especially Macrophages M0, M1, CD4-T-cells, CD8-T-cells, and T cells follicular helper, in most of eight cancer types.

The patients have a dismal prognosis, which has not improved in more than a decade, suggesting that a better understanding of this disease is required. In the study described here, we analyzed two previously published RNA-sequencing data sets and gained further insights into the global transcriptomes of two known subgroups of this disease, which are characterized by the presence or absence of a homeobox gene expression signature. Specifically, we identified a remarkable mutually exclusive expression of the HOXA9/HOXA10 and IRX1 genes and termed the two subgroups iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1. This expression pattern is critical as it suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the two subgroups. Investigation of the transcriptomes of the two subgroups reveals a more aggressive nature for the iALL-IRX1 group, which is further supported by the fact that patients within this group have a worse prognosis and are also diagnosed at a younger age. This could be reflective of a developmentally earlier cell of origin for iALL-IRX1. Our analysis further uncovered critical differences between the two groups that may have an impact on treatment strategies. In summary, after a detailed investigation into the transcriptional profiles of iALL-HOXA9 and iALL-IRX1 patients, we highlight the importance of acknowledging that these two subgroups are different and that this is of clinical importance.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2020.

Delineation of the transcriptomic profile of leukemic subpopulations could aid in a better understanding of molecular biology and provide novel biomarkers. METHODS: Using microarray profiling and quantitative PCR validation, transcript expression was measured in leukemic stem cells (LSC, n = 24) and leukemic blasts (L-blast, n = 25) from pedAML patients in comparison to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs, n = 19) and control myeloblasts (C-blast, n = 20) sorted from healthy subjects. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to identify relevant gene set enrichment signatures, and functional protein associations were identified by STRING analysis. RESULTS: Highly significantly overexpressed genes in LSC and L-blast were identified with a vast majority not studied in AML. CDKN1A, CFP, and CFD (LSC) and HOMER3, CTSA, and GADD45B (L-blast) represent potentially interesting biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Eleven LSC downregulated targets were identified that potentially qualify as tumor suppressor genes, with MYCT1, PBX1, and PTPRD of highest interest. Inflammatory and immune dysregulation appeared to be perturbed biological networks in LSC, whereas dysregulated metabolic profiles were observed in L-blast. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the power of taking into account cell population heterogeneity and reveals novel targets eligible for functional evaluation and therapy in pedAML. IMPACT: Novel transcriptional targets were discovered showing a significant differential expression in LSCs and blasts from pedAML patients compared to their normal counterparts from healthy controls. Deregulated pathways, including immune and metabolic dysregulation, were addressed for the first time in children, offering a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis. These novel targets have the potential of acting as biomarkers for risk stratification, follow-up, and targeted therapy. Multiple LSC-downregulated targets endow tumor suppressor roles in other cancer entities, and further investigation whether hypomethylating therapy could result into LSC eradication in pedAML is warranted.",,"['Depreter, Barbara', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Vandepoele, Karl', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Van Damme, An', 'Terras, Eva', 'Denys, Barbara', 'Dedeken, Laurence', 'Dresse, Marie-Francoise', 'Van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte', 'Hofmans, Mattias', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Lammens, Tim']","['Depreter B', 'De Moerloose B', 'Vandepoele K', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Van Damme A', 'Terras E', 'Denys B', 'Dedeken L', 'Dresse MF', 'Van der Werff Ten Bosch J', 'Hofmans M', 'Philippe J', 'Lammens T']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. barbara.depreter@uzbrussel.be.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', '*Transcriptome']",,,2020/10/18 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2020/10/17 20:18'],"['2020/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/17 20:18 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41390-020-01199-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41390-020-01199-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2021 May;89(7):1695-1705. doi: 10.1038/s41390-020-01199-3.

DNTR-seq readily identified minor subclones within leukemia patients. In a large-scale DNA damage screen, DNTR-seq was used to detect regions under purifying selection and identified genes where mRNA abundance was resistant to copy-number alteration, suggesting strong genetic compensation. mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) quality equals RNA-only methods, and the low positional bias of genomic libraries allowed detection of sub-megabase aberrations at ultra-low coverage. Each cell library is individually addressable and can be re-sequenced at increased depth, allowing multi-tiered study designs. Additionally, the direct tagmentation protocol enables coverage-independent estimation of ploidy, which can be used to identify cell singlets. Thus, DNTR-seq directly links each cell's state to its corresponding genome at scale, enabling routine analysis of heterogeneous tumors and other complex tissues.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

This organization in distinct compartments is essential to allow subcellular processing of regulatory signals and generate specific cellular responses. In the nucleus, genetic information is packaged in the form of chromatin, an organized and repeated nucleoprotein structure that is a source of epigenetic information. In addition, cells organize the distribution of macromolecules via various membrane-less nuclear organelles, which have gathered considerable attention in the last few years. The macromolecular multiprotein complexes known as Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies (PML NBs) are an archetype for nuclear membrane-less organelles. Chromatin interactions with nuclear bodies are important to regulate genome function. In this review, we will focus on the dynamic interplay between PML NBs and chromatin. We report how the structure and formation of PML NBs, which may involve phase separation mechanisms, might impact their functions in the regulation of chromatin dynamics. In particular, we will discuss how PML NBs participate in the chromatinization of viral genomes, as well as in the control of specific cellular chromatin assembly pathways which govern physiological mechanisms such as senescence or telomere maintenance.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Although t(8;21) AML patients have a relatively favorable prognosis, relapse is a frequent occurrence, underscoring the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we showed that t(8;21) AML is characterized by frequent mutation and overexpression of CCND2. Analysis of 19 AML cell lines showed that t(8;21) AML cells had lower IC50 values for the selective CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib and abemaciclib than non-t(8;21) AML cells. CDK4/6 inhibitors caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and impaired cell proliferation in t(8;21) AML cells. CDK4/6 inhibition decreased MAP-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway activity, induced LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion, and enhanced autophagosome formation, suggesting autophagy induction. Treatment of t(8;21) AML cells with the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) or LY294002 in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic (Annexin V positive) cells, whereas CQ or LY294002 single treatment had no significant effects. The effectiveness of co-inhibiting CDK4/6 and autophagy was confirmed in primary t(8;21) AML cells.

NOTCH1 mutations occur in 10% of CLL at diagnosis, associated with a short disease-free interval and increased risk of Richter's transformation. We hypothesised that the incidence of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL with a second LPD may be increased, because the mutation occurs early in leukaemogenesis, permitting clonal divergence. METHODS: We identified 19 patients with biclonal LPD at diagnosis: 11 with CLL and a second LPD (group A) and 8 with a second distinct CLL (group B). NOTCH1 mutation analysis was performed and clinical outcome investigated. RESULTS: Ten of 19 (52%) were NOTCH1 mutated: 5 in group A (45%) and 5 in group B (62.5%) with a favourable clinical outcome observed among this cohort with 28.7 (range 1-99) months of follow-up.

However, cardiac adverse effects, including the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and symptomatic heart failure remain clinical problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the left ventricular systolic functions in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia receiving TKIs. A cross-sectional and observational study was conducted of 37 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia receiving dasatinib or nilotinib after imatinib failure. Left ventricular systolic functions were evaluated using four-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography derived global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GCS), radial (GRS), and area (GAS) strain indices. Mean ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac output and left ventricular mass index were similar between control and patient groups and within normal limits. GLS (- 16.7% vs - 20.8%, p < 0.001), GCS (- 13.0% vs - 15.6%, p = 0.002), and GAS (- 26.2% vs - 31.0, p < 0.001) values were significantly higher in the patient population than those of the controls.

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy adult volunteers and cultured with SCGM added IL-2 and IL-15 for expansion of NK cells. In this culture system, dasatinib of different concentrations were added. Cell counting and phenotyping by flow cytometry were used to evaluate the amplification efficiency of NK cells. FCM was used to detect the expression of receptors on the surface of NK cells and the distribution of subsets. Subsequently, degranulation assay and CFSE/7AAD based cytotoxicity assay were used to detect the effects of dasatinib on NK cytotoxicity against leukemia cell line K562 cells. RESULTS: The expansion efficiency of NK cells in vitro could be increased by dasatinib at the concentration range of 5-50 nmol/L, and the expansion efficiency of NK cells reached the peak at 20 nmol/L of dasatinib. The NK cytotoxicity against K562 cells in dasatinib cultured group at the concentration of 20 nmol/L was significantly higher than that in control group. For the cells cultured by disatinib in vitro, the MFI of CD226, NKP46 and NKG2D was up-regulated; the ratio of NKG2A(+)CD57(-) subset was down-regulated, while the ratio of NKG2A(-)CD57(+) subset was up-regulated.The degranulation response of NKG2A(-)CD57(+) NK cells to K562 cells was stronger than that of NKG2A(+)CD57(-) NK cells. CONCLUSION: The results shows that appropriate dose of dasatinib(20 nmol/L) can increases the amplification efficiency of NK cells, simultaneously up-regulates the expression of NK activating receptors and increases the NKG2A(-)CD57(+) subset, which lead to the enhancement of NK cytotoxicty against leukemia cell lines.",,"['Sheng, Li-Xia', 'Wang, Jia-Ping', 'Lai, Yan-Li', 'Wu, Hao', 'Sun, Yong-Cheng', 'Zhou, Miao', 'Ouyang, Gui-Fang', 'Huang, He']","['Sheng LX', 'Wang JP', 'Lai YL', 'Wu H', 'Sun YC', 'Zhou M', 'Ouyang GF', 'Huang H']","['Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang Province, China,E-mail: ouyangguifang@medmail.com.cn.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang Province, China,E-mail: hehuangyu@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural', '*Leukocytes, Mononuclear']",,,2020/10/18 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/10/17 08:33'],"['2020/10/17 08:33 [entrez]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2020)05-1762-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.05.055 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Oct;28(5):1762-1768. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.05.055.,1762-1768,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical characteristics, treatment response and prognosis of 67 elderly patients with AML (non-M3) admitted to our hospital from June 2008 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received low-intensity conventional chemotherapy (i.e. lower standard dose, and without new drugs listed in China since the 21st century), including DA, HA, CAG, etc. The CR rate, median survival time and 5-year cumulative survival rate of patients were evaluated, and the related indexes were compared with the data reported in domestic and foreign literatures at the same time. RESULTS: The CR rate was 55.2% (37/67), the median survival time was 13.7 months, and the 5-year cumulative survival rate was (24.4+/-6.3)% in patients received low-intensity tradional chemotherapeutic regimens. The CR rates of high-risk group and non-high-risk group were 38.7% (12/31) and 69.4% (25/36), respectively; the median survival time of high-risk group and non-high-risk group was 8.9 months and 25.2 months respectively; the 5-year cumulative survival rate of high-risk group was (10.2+/-6.6)% and that of non-high-risk group was (36.0+/- 9.4)%. Compared with the data reported in the literature at the same time, the data obtained from the low-intensity traditional chemotherapy regimen for the elderly AML did not have an obvious disadvantage, morever had relatively short bone marrow suppression time, low induction early mortality rate and low incidence of severe infection.

METHODS: Clinical data of 41 initially-treated AML children with t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1(+) in our hospital in period from January 2009 to January 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The baseline clinical characteristics, cumulative recurrence, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were recorded, and the influencing factors of prognosis were evaluated by chi2 test and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rates in the first course and the second course of induction chemotherapy were respectively 82.93% (34/41) and 97.56% (40/41). The median EFS time and OS time were 30 months and 31 months respectively. The EFS rate and OS rate of children with CR after the first treatment course were significantly higher than those of children without CR (P0.05). The EFS rate of male children was significantly higher than that of female children (P0.05). The OS rate of children < 10 years old was significantly higher than that of children>/=10 years old (P0.05). The expression level of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene after the second induction remission was the influencing factor of cumulative recurrence rate, EFS rate and OS rate in children (P0.05). Multivariate analysis by Cox regression model showed that the decreased levels of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene expression < 3 log after the second induction remission was the independent risk factor for EFS rate and OS rate in children (P0.05). The cumulative recurrence rate of children with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene expression increase for1 log after decreased 3 log was significantly higher than that of children with</=1 log (P0.05). CONCLUSION: Iuithally-treated AML children with t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1(+) show the fine clinical prognosis after standard chemotherapy.

METHODS: The immunohistochemistry and flow immunotyping data of 31 patients with non-hodgkin lymphoma admitted in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The pathologic immunohistochemical expression of lymphatic cells was compared with that of flow immunotyping types, and the change of expression rate of various antigens in the progression of lymphomas into leukemia stage was studied. The characteristics of immune typing and pathologic immunohistochemistry of lymphoblastic leukemia, and their diagnostic value in lymphoblastic leukemia was observed. RESULTS: All patients with lymphoma reached the leukemia stage. The results of flow immunotyping were basically consistent with the results of pathological immunohistochemistry. The pathological immunohistochemistry showed that CD5, CD3, CD99, CD7, CD34, CD43, etc. mainly expressed in the patients with T lymphocyte lymphoma leukemia, of which CD5 showed the highest expression rate and its positive rate was 100%. The flow immunotyping showed that CD7, CD3, CD2, CD5, CD11b, CD34 and HLA-DR was mainly expressed in the patients with T lymphocyte lymphoma leukemia, of which CD7 was the most sensitive and its positive rate was 100 %. Although the antigens expressed in the pathologic immunohistochemistry and flow immunotyping were basically consistent, there were differences in the expression rates of various antigens, CD20, CD79a, BCL-2, CD10, and the Hodgkin's lymphoma cell antigen PAX5 derived from B cells them mainly expressed in BLL patients assay by pathological immunohistochemistry, among the expression rate of CD20 was 100%, which was higher than other antigen expression rate. CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, skappa, and early antigen HLA-DR mainly expressed in BLL patients assayed by flow immunotyping, among them CD19 showed a positive rate of 94.7%.

METHODS: A total of 132 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation and 136 AML patients with FLT3-WT were selected. Clinical data and the number, length and rearrangement ratio of FLT3-ITD mutations were collected. The ratio of CD4(+) T cells, regulatory T cellsTregs, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, natural killer cellsNK cells and macrophage in peripheral bloodPB were analyzed by flow cytometry. Correlation of NK cell ratio with FLT3-ITD mutation number, length and rearrangement ratio was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect RIPK1 protein and mRNA levels in NK cells, respectively. Plasma RIPK activity was detected by ELISA, and Pearson corre-lation analysis was performed for the correlation of RIPK with FLT3-ITD mutation number, length and rearrangement ratio. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to analyze the survival rate of AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation. RESULTS: Compared with AML patients with FLT3-WT, the white blood cell count in patients with FLT3-ITD mutation significantly increased, PB and BM blasts significantly decreased. There was no significant change in PB CD3(+) T cells, Tregs, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, M1 and M2 type macrophage of AML patients with FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD mutationCompared with AML patients with FLT3-WT, CD4(+) T cells significantly decreased, NK cells significantly increased in AML patients wtih FLT3-ITD mutation. NK cells ratio in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation significantly positively correlated with the number of FLT3-ITD mutations and rearrangement bases. Plasma RIPK1 activity, RIPK1 protein and mRNA levels in NK cells of AML patients with FLT3-ITD were significantly lower than those of AML patients with FLT3-WT, and negatively correlated with the number of FLT3-ITD mutations, the length of rearranged bases (>/=52 bp) and the ratio of rearranged bases. The survival rate of AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation in low RIPK1 activity after Rydapt treatment was significantly higher than that in high RIPK1 activity.

METHODS: Ninty-three patients with newly diagnosed CLL were tested by five probes including RB1 (13q14.1), D13S25 (13q14.3), p53(17p13.1), ATM( 11q22.3) and CSP12, while conventional cytogenetics (CC) was used for karyotype analysis. Then the correlation of the molecular cytogenetic abnormalities with the clinical Binet stages, Rai stages and the other related laboratory examinations was analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rate of chromosome abnormality in 93 patients was 79.6%, out of which detection rate of 13q (13q- was the highest and accounted for 45.2%), followed by trisomy 12 (+12) 26.9%, p53 deletion (17p-) 19.4% and ATM deletion (11p-) 17.2%. There were 27 cases (29.0%) with 2 or more abnormalities, including 13 cases with 13q-/17q-, 5 with 13q-/11q-, and 4 with 13q-/+12. Compared with CC test results, the positive rate of FISH detection was significantly higher (chi(2)=32.127, P0.01). There was no significant correlation between FISH results and Rai stages (P0.05), meanwhile 17p- highly correlated with later stage of the Binet stages (P=0.012). The molecular cytogenetic abnormalities significantly correlated with age, absolute value of peripheral lymphocyte count and CD38 expression level (P0.05). The incidence of 13q- in female (65.4%) was statistically significantly higher than that in male (37.3%) (P=0.015). The unmutated IGHV rate of CLL patients with a 17p- was significantly higher than that in patients without this genetic abnormality (P=0.013). The expression of CD38 was detected among 29.0% of the patients, which significantly correlated with Binet stages (P=0.027) and unmutated IGHV (P=0.006).

METHODS: Nalm-6 and Sup-B15 cell lines were treated with different concentrations of Huaier aqueous extract and chemotherapeutics including VCR, DNR, L-Asp alone or in combination for 48 h, and the growth inhibitory effect and IC50 values (the half maximal inhibitory concentration) were detected by CCK-8. Jin's formula was used to estimated the synergistic effect of these combinations. Apoptosis rates of Nalm-6 and Sup-B15 cells and expression of apoptosis-related proteins BAX, BCL-2, cleaved Caspase-3 were determined by flow cytometry and Western blot respectivcly. RESULTS: Huaier aqueous extract, VCR, DNR and L-Asp had inhibition effect on Nalm-6 and Sup-B15 cell lines. The inhibition rate of Huaier aqueous extract combined with VCR, DNR and L-Asp were all higher than those of each dug alone (P0.05) and the combination index (q) was between 0.85 and 1.15 or greater than 1.15. The two kinds of drugs showed had additive or synergistic effects. The results of flow cytometry showed that the cell apoptosis rates in combined treatment group were higher than those of each drug alone (P0.05). The results of Western blot revealed that Huaier aqueous extract and VCR all decreased protein expression of BCL-2 (P0.05) and increase protein expression of BAX (P0.05) and cleaved Caspase-3 (P0.05) in Nalm-6 and Sup-B15 cells. Compared with Huaier aqueous extract or VCR alone, the effect of two drug combination were more significant. DNR down-regulated protein expression of BCL-2 (P0.05) and up-regulated cleaved Caspase-3 (P0.05). However, it had no effect on the expression of BAX in Nalm-6 and Sup-B15 cells. When it was combined with Huaier aqueous extract, the expression of cleaved Caspase-3 and BCL-2 showed more significant changes.

METHODS: 12 senile patients with high-risk AML received decitabine combined with reduced FLAG regimen (decitabine 20 mg/m(2), intravenous drip, qd, d 1-5; fludarabine 30 mg/m(2), intravenous drip lasts 30 min, qd, d 3-6; Ara-C 1 g/m(2), intravenous drip, qd, d 3-6; and G-CSF 300 mug/d, subcu- taneous injection, d 2 to neutrophils reached the lowest return to1.0x10(9)/L) in our study. The efficacy and adverse reactions of this regimen were analyzed. RESULTS: 9 patients achieved complete remission(CR) after one course of decitabine combined with reduced FLAG regimen, 2 patients achieved partial remission (PR) and 1 patient reached a stable disease (SD). The overall response rate was 92%. The median follow-up period was 7.4 months ranged from 3 to 12 months. The median survival time for all patients was 6.4 months. The main treatment-related toxicities were myelosuppression and infection due to neutropenia. Severe non-hematologic toxicities were not observed in these patients, and there was no treatment-related mortality. CONCLUSION: Decitabine combined with reduced FLAG regimen has a definite clinical efficacy in the treatment of senile patients with high-risk AML.

METHODS: The microarray gene chip technology was used to statistically analyze the lncRNA in bone marrow cells of newly diagnose AL children and control children. Ninty-seren differentially expressed lncRNAs were selected. The bone marrow specimens of ALL children (21 cases), AML children (22 cases) and control children (21 cases) were verified and compared by using qRT-PCR; then the lncRNA with maximum differential expression-lncRNA AC002454.1 was selected and used to analyze the relation of relative expression level with clinical indicators. RESULTS: The microarray gene chip detection showed that 1 884 differentially expressed lncRNA were found in ALL children, and 4 289 differentically expressed lncRNA were found in AML children. The results confirming these differentically expressed lncRNA by qRT-PCR showed that 9 lncRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in ALL children, and 12 lncRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in AML children. Among these up-regulated lncRNA, the difference of AC002454.1 expression was most significant in ALL and AML children (P0.05, P0.01). The detection showed that there was a significant difference, in AC002454.1 relative expression level of newly diagnosed T-ALL and B-ALL children (P0.01), moreover, this difference also was found in ALL and AML children (P0.05). The detection analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in AC002454.1 relative expression level among the different sex, age, WBC count at initial diagnosis, chromosome, fusion gene, and risk stratification (P0.05 for all).

Oprozomib (Cpd 21) was chosen for the subsequent experiments. The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was then performed to identify the responsible pathway relative to apoptosis and the results showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones were upregulated. Apoptosis was attributed to a joint effect of calcium leakage andPERK and IRE1alpha phosphorylation. The PERK branch was responsible for the first wave of cell death that occurred within 24 hours. The later wave of apoptosis was mediated by IRE1alpha, which transmit apoptotic signals through the ASK-JNK-BIM axis. Release of Ca2+ from ER into cytosol resulted in activation of calpain, which, in turn, cleaved caspase-12. Our data also explained the selective killing effects of oprozomib on CML cells, which relied on proteasome activity. The present study demonstrated that prolonged inhibition of proteasome to trigger unfolded protein response could be an alternative strategy for treating CML in light of tyrosine kinase inhibitors resistance.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

However, the panoramic picture of pepsinogen gene family in human cancer is not clear. This study focused on elucidating the expression profile, activated pathway, immune cells infiltration, mutation, and copy number variation of PGs and their potential role in human cancer. METHOD: Based on the next generation sequence data from TCGA, Oncomine, and CCLE, the molecular changes and clinical correlation of PGs in 33 tumor types were analyzed systematically by R language, including the expression, mutation, and copy number variation of PGs and their correlation with cancer-related signal transduction pathway, immune cell infiltration, and prognostic potential in different cancers. RESULTS: PGs expression profiles appear different in 33 tumors. The transcriptional expression of PGs was detected in 16 of all 33 tumors. PGC was highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma and breast cancer, while decreased in stomach adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal carcinoma. PGA3, PGA4, and PGA5 were expressed in most normal tissues, but decreased in cancer tissues. PGs expression was significantly related to the activation or inhibition of many signal transduction pathways, in which PGC and PGA5 are more likely to be associated with cancer-related pathways. PGC participated in 33 regulatory network pathways in pan-cancer, mainly distributed in stomach adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. PGC and PGA3 expression were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration. The results of survival analysis showed that different PGs expression play significantly different prognostic roles in different cancers. PGC was correlated with poor survival in brain lower grade glioma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and higher survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, mesothelioma, and uveal melanoma. PGA4 was only associated with higher survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Genetic variation analysis showed that PGC gene often mutated in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma had extensive copy number amplification in various tumor types. PGC expression was upregulated with the increase of copy number in cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, while in stomach adenocarcinoma, PGC was upregulated regardless of whether the copy number was increased or decreased. CONCLUSIONS: PGs was expressed unevenly in a variety of cancer tissues and was related to many carcinogenic pathways and involved in the immune regulation. PGC participated in 33 regulatory pathways in human cancer. Different PGs expression play significantly different prognostic roles in different cancers. The variation of copy number of PGC gene could affect the PGC expression. These findings suggested that PGs, especially PGC have characteristic of broad-spectrum expression in multiple cancers rather than being confined to the gastric mucosa, which may made PGs be useful biomarkers for prediction/diagnosis/prognosis and effective targets for treatment in human cancer.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: We included children receiving cancer treatments who were 8-18 years of age. Three patient types were enrolled: inpatients receiving active cancer treatment, outpatients receiving maintenance acute lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapy, and outpatients in survivorship. Amount of bother due to feeling scared or worried yesterday or today was self-reported using the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi) on a 0-4 scale. Risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 502 children included, 225 (45.0%) reported any degree of bother (score >/= 1) and 29 (5.8%) reported severe bother (score >/= 3) for feeling scared or worried. In multiple regression evaluating any bother, boys were less likely to be bothered (odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.87) and inpatients receiving active cancer treatment were more likely to be bothered compared to outpatients in survivorship (OR 3.58, 95% CI 2.00-6.52). The only factor associated with being severely bothered by feeling scared or worried was clinic visit or admission due to fever (OR 4.57, 95% CI 1.24-13.60).

In this case-control study nested in a cohort of 859 leukemia patients, cases (n = 17) were patients diagnosed with intracranial hemorrhage who were matched with control patients (n = 55). We documented platelet counts and transfusions for seven days before the intracranial hemorrhage in cases and in a ""matched"" week for control patients. Three measures of platelet count exposure were assessed in four potentially important time periods before hemorrhage. Among these leukemia patients, we observed the cumulative incidence of intracranial hemorrhage of 3.5%. Low platelet counts were, especially in the three to seven days preceding intracranial hemorrhage, associated with the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, although with wide confidence intervals. Platelet transfusions during the week preceding the hemorrhage were associated with higher incidences of intracranial hemorrhage; rate ratios (95% confidence interval) for one or two platelet transfusions and for more than two transfusions compared with none were 4.04 (0.73 to 22.27) and 8.91 (1.53 to 51.73) respectively.

Although ECD is not commonly recognized to have overt peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) disease, we recently identified that ECD patients have a high frequency of a concomitant myeloid malignancy. We thus conducted a systematic clinical and molecular analysis of the BM from 120 ECD patients. Surprisingly, 42.5% of ECD patients (51 of 120) had clonal hematopoiesis whereas 15.8% of patients (19 of 120) developed an overt hematologic malignancy (nearly all of which were a myeloid neoplasm). The most frequently mutated genes in BM were TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, and NRAS. ECD patients with clonal hematopoiesis were more likely to be older (P < .0001), have retroperitoneal involvement (P = .02), and harbor a BRAFV600E mutation (P = .049) than those without clonal hematopoiesis. The presence of the TET2 mutation was associated with a BRAFV600E mutation in tissue ECD lesions (P = .0006) and TET2-mutant ECD patients were more likely to have vascular involvement than TET2 wild-type ECD patients. Clonal hematopoiesis mutations in ECD were detected in cells derived from CD34+CD38- BM progenitors and PB monocytes but less frequently present in PB B and T lymphocytes. These data identify a heretofore unrecognized high frequency of clonal hematopoiesis in ECD patients, reaffirm the development of additional high risk of myeloid neoplasms in ECD, and provide evidence of a BM-based precursor cell of origin for many patients with ECD.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cohen Aubart, Fleur', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Armand, Marine', 'Marceau-Renaut, Alice', 'Emile, Jean-Francois', 'Duployez, Nicolas', 'Charlotte, Frederic', 'Poulain, Stephanie', 'Lhote, Raphael', 'Helias-Rodzewicz, Zofia', 'Della-Valle, Veronique', 'Bernard, Olivier', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Donadieu, Jean', 'Amoura, Zahir', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Haroche, Julien']","['Cohen Aubart F', 'Roos-Weil D', 'Armand M', 'Marceau-Renaut A', 'Emile JF', 'Duployez N', 'Charlotte F', 'Poulain S', 'Lhote R', 'Helias-Rodzewicz Z', 'Della-Valle V', 'Bernard O', 'Maloum K', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Donadieu J', 'Amoura Z', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Haroche J']","['Service de Medecine Interne 2, Centre National de Reference Histiocytoses, and.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France."", 'Gustave Roussy, Unite 1170, INSERM, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Unite 1170, INSERM, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Contre le Cancer de Lille, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 9020, and.', 'Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies (CANTHER), UMR-S 1277, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Lille, INSERM, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', 'EA4340, Universite Versailles-Saint Quentin, Versailles, France.', 'Departement de Pathologie, Hopital Ambroise Pare, AP-HP, Boulogne, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Contre le Cancer de Lille, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 9020, and.', 'Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies (CANTHER), UMR-S 1277, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Lille, INSERM, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', ""Service d'Anatomopathologie and."", 'Institut de Recherche Contre le Cancer de Lille, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 9020, and.', 'Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies (CANTHER), UMR-S 1277, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Lille, INSERM, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne 2, Centre National de Reference Histiocytoses, and.', 'EA4340, Universite Versailles-Saint Quentin, Versailles, France.', 'Departement de Pathologie, Hopital Ambroise Pare, AP-HP, Boulogne, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Unite 1170, INSERM, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy, Unite 1170, INSERM, Villejuif, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Pediatrique, Hopital Trousseau, AP-HP, Paris, France; and."", 'Service de Medecine Interne 2, Centre National de Reference Histiocytoses, and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Service de Medecine Interne 2, Centre National de Reference Histiocytoses, and.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Clonal Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Erdheim-Chester Disease/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics']",PMC8555377,,2020/10/18 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2020/10/17 05:30'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/28 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/17 05:30 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00143-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020005101 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jan 28;137(4):485-492. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020005101.,485-492,,,,,,,['Blood. 2021 Jan 28;137(4):434-436.

Patients (age >/=1 year or <18 years) received 3 doses of InO (days 1, 8, and 15) per course. Dose escalation was based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during course 1. Dose level 1 (DL1) was 1.4 mg/m2 (0.6, 0.4, 0.4 mg/m2) and DL2 was 1.8 mg/m2 (0.8, 0.5, 0.5 mg/m2). Secondary end points included safety, antileukemic activity, and pharmacokinetics. Twenty-five patients (23 evaluable for DLTs) were enrolled. In course 1, the first cohort had 1 of 6 (DL1) and 2 of 5 (DL2) patients who experienced DLTs; subsequent review considered DL2 DLTs to be non-dose-limiting.

Twenty-three patients experienced grade 3 to 4 adverse events; hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was reported in 2 patients after subsequent chemotherapy.

Therapeutic targeting of multiple BCL2 family proteins enhances tumor killing but is also associated with increased systemic toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the dual targeting of MCL1 and BCL2 proteins using the small molecules S63845 and venetoclax induces durable remissions in mice that harbor human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors but is accompanied by hematologic toxicity and weight loss. To mitigate these toxicities, we encapsulated S63845 or venetoclax into nanoparticles that target P-selectin, which is enriched in tumor endothelial cells. In vivo and ex vivo imaging demonstrated preferential targeting of the nanoparticles to lymphoma tumors over vital organs.

Despite advances in the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to induce a durable deep molecular response, more than half of patients relapse upon treatment discontinuation. This clinical finding supports the paradigm that leukemia stem cells feed the neoplasm, resist tyrosine kinase inhibition, and reactivate upon drug withdrawal depending on the fitness of the patient's immune surveillance. This concept lends support to the idea that treatment-free remission is not achieved solely with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and that new molecular targets independent of BCR-ABL1 signaling are needed in order to develop adjuvant therapy to more efficiently eradicate the leukemia stem cell population responsible for chemoresistance and relapse. Future efforts must focus on the identification of new targets to support the discovery of potent and safe small molecules able to specifically eradicate the leukemic stem cell population. In this review, we briefly discuss molecular maintenance in leukemia stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia and provide a more in-depth discussion of the dual-specificity kinase DYRK2, which has been identified as a novel actionable checkpoint in a critical leukemic network. DYRK2 controls the activation of p53 and proteasomal degradation of c-MYC, leading to impaired survival and self-renewal of leukemia stem cells; thus, pharmacological activation of DYRK2 as an adjuvant to standard therapy has the potential to induce treatment-free remission.",,"['Park, Chun Shik', 'Lacorazza, H Daniel']","['Park CS', 'Lacorazza HD']","[""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA. hdl@bcm.edu.""]",['eng'],['R01 CA207086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Dyrk kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Energy Metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC8080801,,2020/10/18 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2020/10/17 05:28'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/17 05:28 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s12276-020-00515-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s12276-020-00515-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2020 Oct;52(10):1663-1672. doi: 10.1038/s12276-020-00515-5.

Residual signaling pathways that maintain survival of CLL cells might be targeted to improve ibrutinib's therapeutic activity, but the nature of these pathways is unclear. Ongoing activation of IFN receptors in patients on ibrutinib was suggested by the presence of type I and II IFN in blood together with the cycling behavior of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products when IFN signaling was blocked intermittently with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib. IFN signaling in CLL cells from human patients was not prevented by ibrutinib in vitro or in vivo, but ISG expression was significantly attenuated in vitro. ISGs such as CXCL10 that require concomitant activation of NF-kappaB were decreased when this pathway was inhibited by ibrutinib. Other ISGs, exemplified by LAG3, were decreased as a result of inhibited protein translation. Effects of IFN on survival remained intact as type I and II IFN-protected CLL cells from ibrutinib in vitro, which could be prevented by ruxolitinib and IFNR blocking Abs. These observations suggest that IFNs may help CLL cells persist and specific targeting of IFN signaling might deepen clinical responses of patients on ibrutinib.","['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Xia, Meihui', 'Luo, Tina Yuxuan', 'Shi, Yonghong', 'Wang, Guizhi', 'Tsui, Hubert', 'Harari, Daniel', 'Spaner, David E']","['Xia M', 'Luo TY', 'Shi Y', 'Wang G', 'Tsui H', 'Harari D', 'Spaner DE']","['Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, First Hospital, Jilin University, 130021 Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Jilin University, 130021 Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, Ontario M4C 3E7, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100 Rehovot, Israel.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada; david.spaner@sunnybrook.ca.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2C4, Canada.']",['eng'],['374817/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Nitriles', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Receptors, Interferon/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2020/10/18 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/10/17 05:25'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/17 05:25 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.2000478 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.2000478 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Nov 15;205(10):2629-2639. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2000478.

The outgrowth of tumor subclones carrying mutations in genes responsible for resistance to therapy has led to a Darwinian model of clonal selection. Previous work has indicated that alterations in the epigenome might contribute to clonal selection, yet the extent to which the chromatin state is altered under the selective pressures of therapy is unknown. To address this, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation, gene expression analysis, and enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on a cohort of paired diagnosis and relapse samples from individual patients who all but one relapsed within 36 months of initial diagnosis. The chromatin state at diagnosis varied widely among patients, while the majority of peaks remained stable between diagnosis and relapse. Yet a significant fraction was either lost or newly gained, with some patients showing few differences and others showing massive changes of the epigenetic state. Evolution of the epigenome was associated with pathways previously linked to therapy resistance as well as novel candidate pathways through alterations in pyrimidine biosynthesis and downregulation of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets.

Data indicates the unfavorable success rate of TFR. This study aimed to compare and evaluate the clinical value of dd-PCR in predicting relapse in CML patients entering TFR. Using dd-PCR and RT-qPCR technology, dynamic BCR/ABL transcripts were detected in 13 CML patients who discontinued TKI treatment after sustaining undetectable BCR-ABL levels for a median time of 25 months. The results showed that in 13 patients, only 2 cases (22.2%) of 9 patients who executed planned discontinuation achieved TFR within 12 months. In the first 6 months, the detection rate of BCR/ABL transcripts by dd-PCR was higher than that by RT-qPCR and the two methods kept a positive correlation (r=0.9651, P=0.0349). Meanwhile, the time of detectable BCR/ABL by dd-PCR were significantly shorter (P<0.05), which was an average of 2.98 months earlier than RT-qPCR. The total TKI therapy and MR4.5 duration time related with TFR were longer in patients with intermediate or high Sokal risk scores (p<0.05). The dd-PCR could be more sensitive than RT-qPCR for monitoring BCR/ABL transcripts of CML patients with deep molecular response to TKI. The technique can be used as a preferred method to detect the transcripts in the first 6 months after TKI cessation.","['(c) 2020 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Zhu, Guiyang', 'Yang, Yuchao', 'Wang, Hongwei', 'Xie, Juan', 'Hu, Jinjun', 'Guo, Wenzheng', 'Zhang, Lingli', 'Liu, Zhuang', 'Chen, Xiuhua', 'Chang, Jianmei', 'Xu, Jing', 'Tan, Yanhong']","['Zhu G', 'Yang Y', 'Wang H', 'Xie J', 'Hu J', 'Guo W', 'Zhang L', 'Liu Z', 'Chen X', 'Chang J', 'Xu J', 'Tan Y']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China tanyh2010@163.com tanyanhong@sxmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/analysis/blood', 'China', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods']",,,2020/10/18 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/10/17 05:24'],"['2020/10/17 05:24 [entrez]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['50/5/591 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2020 Sep;50(5):591-599.,591-599,,,['NOTNLM'],"['RT-qPCR', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'deep molecular response', 'droplet digital PCR', 'treatment-free remission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal bone marrow-derived Fibs (nFibs) do not express CD34 or CD45; however, nFibs may express hematopoietic markers with some specific stimulations. CD34 expression was detected in nFib cultures following the addition of a culture supernatant of blood mononuclear cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-P. To identify the molecules responsible for inducing CD34 expression in nFibs, cDNA clones were isolated using functional expression cloning with a library constructed from PHA-P-stimulated human blood mononuclear cells. Positive clones inducing CD34 transcription in nFibs were selected. We confirmed that an isolated positive cDNA clone encoded human interleukin (IL)-1 beta (beta). CD34 expression was observed in the nFib cultures with recombinant human (rh) IL-1beta protein. And CD34 transcription was suppressed when a rhIL-1beta neutralizing antibody was added to the IL-1beta-stimulated nFib cultures. nFibs expressed gp130 and IL-6 receptors, and CD45 expression was detected in nFibs cultured with rhIL-1beta and rhIL-6. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells reportedly respond well to IL-1beta. When CML-derived Fibs were cultured with rhIL-1beta and rhIL-6, CD45-positive cells increased in number.

The pattern of rare communicable diseases that can affect people returning to EU/EEA from travel abroad, visiting EU/EEA or establishing in the EU/EEA is of special relevance. The objective of this manuscript is to give an overview about the EURaDMoG study and discuss the feasibility of establishing a European network on rare communicable diseases and other rare conditions linked to mobility and globalization. METHODS: We undertook a three-steps process where we first conducted a narrative review to estimate the prevalence and incidence and to list rare communicable and non-communicable diseases linked to mobility and globalization in the EU/EEA; second, we organized an international consultation workshop with experts in the diseases previously selected; and finally, the feasibility study analysed how successful a European expert network on rare diseases linked to mobility and globalization focused on health care provision would be, accounting for different operational and also sustainability criteria. RESULTS: First, considering the areas or topics that the network should cover, it was concluded that communicable and non-communicable rare diseases linked to mobility and globalization should be differentiated. Second, since all non-communicable rare diseases linked to mobility and globalization identified are already covered by different European Reference Networks (ERNs), there is no need for them to be included in a new European network. Three scenarios were considered for establishing a potential European network for rare communicable diseases linked to Mobility and Globalisation with a focus on Health Care provision: 1) To maintain the current situation ""Status Quo"" scenario; 2) to create a specific European expert network (EEN) on rare communicable diseases linked to mobility and globalisation; 3) to develop a new ERN on communicable rare diseases linked to mobility and globalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Since the focus is the provision of health care, an ERN could have the potential to better boost the quality of care being facilitated by technological tools and online platforms that permit the safe and ethically acceptable exchange of data. However, this potential new network should not eclipse current existing networks and they should be complementary.",,"['Requena-Mendez, Ana', 'Bisoffi, Zeno', 'Vives-Corrons, Joan-Lluis', 'Gascon, Joaquim', 'Plasencia, Antoni']","['Requena-Mendez A', 'Bisoffi Z', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Gascon J', 'Plasencia A']","['Barcelona Institute for Global Health (Hospital Clinic- Universitat de Barcelona), Barcelona, Spain. ana.requena@isglobal.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden. ana.requena@isglobal.org.', 'Department of Infectious - Tropical Diseases and Microbiology, IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital, Negrar (Verona), Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Institute for Leukaemia Research Josep Carreras (IJC), Badalona (Barcelona), Spain.', 'Barcelona Institute for Global Health (Hospital Clinic- Universitat de Barcelona), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Institute for Global Health (Hospital Clinic- Universitat de Barcelona), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,,IM,"['*Communicable Diseases/epidemiology', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Europe', 'European Union', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', '*Rare Diseases/epidemiology']",PMC7563907,,2020/10/18 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/10/17 05:19'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/17 05:19 [entrez]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13023-020-01534-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13023-020-01534-1 [pii]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2020 Oct 16;15(1):291. doi: 10.1186/s13023-020-01534-1.,291,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4422-241X'],20201016,['NOTNLM'],"['*Communicable diseases', '*Globalisation', '*Imported diseases', '*Mobility', '*Rare diseases', '*Rare infections']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, traditional approaches for managing burn infections are not always effective. High-voltage, pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment shortly after a burn injury has demonstrated an antimicrobial effect in vivo; however, the working parameters and long-term effects of PEF treatment have not yet been investigated. Approach: Nine sets of PEF parameters were investigated to optimize the applied voltage, pulse duration, and frequency or pulse repetition for disinfection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in a stable mouse burn wound model. The bacterial load after PEF administration was monitored for 3 days through bioluminescence imaging. Histological assessments and inflammation response analyses were performed at 1 and 24 h after the therapy. Results: Among all tested PEF parameters, the best disinfection efficacy of P. aeruginosa infection was achieved with a combination of 500 V, 100 mus, and 200 pulses delivered at 3 Hz through two plate electrodes positioned 1 mm apart for up to 3 days after the injury. Histological examinations revealed fewer inflammatory signs in PEF-treated wounds compared with untreated infected burns. Moreover, the expression levels of multiple inflammatory-related cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1alpha/beta, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1alpha/beta and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]), and inflammation-related factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) were significantly decreased in the infected burn wound after PEF treatment. Innovation: We showed that PEF treatment on infected wounds reduces the P. aeruginosa load and modulates inflammatory responses.

We aimed to identify the incidence, causes, and risk factors of readmission following inpatient chemotherapy among ALL patients, using 2016 National Readmission Database. We applied three different definitions of 30-day readmission: (1) nonelective readmission based on readmission type, (2) unplanned readmission defined by CMS, and (3) unintentional readmission, combining (1) and (2). We used unweighted multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance estimates for risk factors analysis, including patient-, hospital-, and admission-related characteristics. Percentage for nonelective, unplanned, and unintentional readmission were 33.3%, 22.4%, and 18.5%, respectively. The top three causes for unplanned readmissions were neutropenia/agranulocytosis (27.8%), septicemia (15.3%), and pancytopenia (11.5%). Risk ratios for unintentional readmission were 1.21 (1.08-1.36) for nonelective vs. elective admission, 1.19 (1.06-1.33) for public vs. private insurance enrollees, 0.96 (0.95-0.98) for each day of hospital stay, 0.77 (0.62-0.95) for large teaching and 0.87 (0.70-1.08) for small teaching vs. nonteaching hospitals. Possible strategies to reduce readmission among ALL patients could be shortening the gap in quality of care among teaching vs. non-teaching hospitals, understanding the difference between privately vs. publicly insured patients, and avoiding aggressive discharge after chemotherapy.",,"['Tran, Phuong T', 'Slayton, William B', 'Dalal, Mansi', 'Brown, Joshua']","['Tran PT', 'Slayton WB', 'Dalal M', 'Brown J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology-HUTECH, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32608, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Safety, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Healthcare (Basel),"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",101666525,,,,PMC7720128,,2020/10/18 06:00,2020/10/18 06:01,['2020/10/17 01:04'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/17 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/18 06:01 [medline]']","['healthcare8040401 [pii]', '10.3390/healthcare8040401 [doi]']",epublish,Healthcare (Basel). 2020 Oct 14;8(4). pii: healthcare8040401. doi: 10.3390/healthcare8040401.,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2973-1021'],20201014,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'quality of care', 'readmission', 'risk factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reportedly exert anti-cancer effects in CCA and lower the risk of CCA; however, the underlying mechanism of these effects remains unclear. The proliferative and oncogenic activities of the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) are driven by its association with the TEA domain (TEAD) of transcription factors; thereby, upregulating genes that promote cell growth, inhibit apoptosis, and confer chemoresistance. This study investigated the effects of atorvastatin in combination with gemcitabine on the progression of human CCA associated with YAP oncogenic regulation. Both atorvastatin and gemcitabine concentration-dependently suppressed the proliferation of HuCCT-1 and KKU-M213 human CCA cells. Moreover, both agents induced cellular apoptosis by upregulating the pro-apoptotic marker BAX and downregulating the anti-apoptotic markers MCL1 and BCL2. Atorvastatin also significantly decreased the mRNA expression of the TEAD target genes CTGF, CYR61, ANKRD1, and MFAP5 in both CCA cell lines. A xenograft tumor growth assay indicated that atorvastatin and gemcitabine potently repressed human CCA cell-derived subcutaneous tumor growth by inhibiting YAP nuclear translocation and TEAD transcriptional activation. Notably, the anti-cancer effects of the individual agents were significantly enhanced in combination. These results indicate that gemcitabine plus atorvastatin could serve as a potential novel treatment option for CCA.",,"['Kitagawa, Koh', 'Moriya, Kei', 'Kaji, Kosuke', 'Saikawa, Soichiro', 'Sato, Shinya', 'Nishimura, Norihisa', 'Namisaki, Tadashi', 'Akahane, Takemi', 'Mitoro, Akira', 'Yoshiji, Hitoshi']","['Kitagawa K', 'Moriya K', 'Kaji K', 'Saikawa S', 'Sato S', 'Nishimura N', 'Namisaki T', 'Akahane T', 'Mitoro A', 'Yoshiji H']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Nara Medical University, 840 Shijo-cho, Kashihara, Nara 634-8522, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Ankrd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (CCN1 protein, human)', '0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine-Rich Protein 61)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MFAP5 protein, human)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (YES1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticholesteremic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Atorvastatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Contractile Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cysteine-Rich Protein 61/genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7589854,,2020/10/18 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/10/17 01:04'],"['2020/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/17 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21207588 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21207588 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Oct 14;21(20). pii: ijms21207588. doi: 10.3390/ijms21207588.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3158-5318', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6675-0475']",20201014,['NOTNLM'],"['HMG-CoA reductase', 'TEAD transcriptional activation', 'atorvastatin', 'cholangiocarcinoma', 'gemcitabine', 'yes-associated protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic lesion as well as the clinical phenotype are extremely variable; many patients present hematological malignancies, especially MDS with the possibility to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. Variable immune dysfunction, especially resulting in B- and NK-cell lymphopenia, lead to severe infections, including generalized warts and mycobacterial infection. Defects of alveolar macrophages lead to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis through inadequate clearance of surfactant proteins. Currently, there are no clear guidelines for the monitoring and treatment of patients with GATA2 mutations. In patients with MDS, the only curative treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) that restores normal hematopoiesis preventing the progression to acute myeloid leukemia and clears long-standing infections.

The aim of this study was to analyze mutations in the BLV LTR region and tax gene to determine their association with transcriptional activity. LTRs were obtained from one hundred and six BLV isolates and analyzed for their genetic variability. Fifteen variants were selected and characterized based on mutations in LTR regulatory elements, and further used for in vitro transcription assays. Reporter vectors containing the luciferase gene under the control of each variant BLV promoter sequence, in addition to variant Tax expression vectors, were constructed. Both types of plasmids were used for cotransfection of HeLa cells and the level of luciferase activity was measured as a proxy of transcriptional activity. Marked differences in LTR promoter activity and Tax transactivation activity were observed amongst BLV variants.

This study aimed to assess HRQoL in children with ALL, affecting factors, and the relationship between parent proxy-report and child self-report HRQoL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 59 children and their parents (both mother and father) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Turkish version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Modules were used to determine HRQoL. RESULTS: According to subscales of the self-report form, nausea and operational anxiety scores differed significantly by the treatment status; communication score varied considerably by the hospitalization length of stay; pain and hurt, cognitive problems, and perceived physical appearance scores differed significantly by the maternal chronic disease status (P<0.05). The presence of maternal chronic disease was significantly related to the total score of the parent-proxy report (mother) (P<0.05). There was a moderate correlation between total scores of child and mother (P<0.05, r=0.419) but not with the father. CONCLUSION: Children on-treatment had significant problems in nausea and procedural anxiety subscales; however, children who were hospitalized more had fewer issues in the communication subscale. Also, children whose mother had chronic disease had poorer HRQoL regarding pain and hurt cognitive problems and treatment anxiety. Given the importance of assessment and monitoring HRQoL in children with ALL, health professionals should be aware of how parents' chronic disease affects HRQoL. Psychosocial support should be provided to children and their parents, especially for those whose parents have a chronic illness.",,"['Ocak, Ece', 'Yozgat, Ayca K', 'Kacar, Dilek', 'Sucakli, Iclal A', 'Ozbek, Namik Y', 'Uneri, Ozden S', 'Yarali, Nese']","['Ocak E', 'Yozgat AK', 'Kacar D', 'Sucakli IA', 'Ozbek NY', 'Uneri OS', 'Yarali N']","['Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pediatric Hematology.', 'Pediatric Hematology.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pediatric Hematology.', ""Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Ankara City Hospital Children's Hospital."", 'Pediatric Hematology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', '*Self Report', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/10/17 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/10/16 20:19'],"['2020/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/16 20:19 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001959 [doi]', '00043426-202101000-00024 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jan;43(1):e56-e63. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001959.,e56-e63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In-depth immune profiling of NK cells can predict therapeutic response in these patients. In the present study, we showed that CD56-negative (CD56(neg) ) NK cells increased exclusively in cytomegalovirus-seropositive (CMV(+) ) patients treated with dasatinib. The increase longitudinally paralleled with progressive differentiation of CD56(dim) NK cells during dasatinib therapy driven by CMV reactivation as shown by principal component analysis on 19 NK cell markers. The CD56(neg) NK cells showed downregulation of NK-activating receptors, upregulation of PD-1, and lower cytotoxicity and cytokine production, indicating that these cells are anergic and dysfunctional as seen in chronic infections with HIV-1 or hepatitis C virus. Moreover, cytolytic activity of CD56(dim) and CD56(neg) NK cells against leukemia cells was partially restored by nivolumab in proportion to the frequency of PD-1(+) NK cells. The proportion of patients who achieved deep molecular responses at 2 years was significantly higher in dasatinib-treated patients with >/=3% CD56(neg) NK cells than in those with fewer CD56(neg) NK cells (54.5% vs 15.8%, P = .0419). These findings suggest that CD56(neg) NK cells may be an exhausted population induced by chronic activation through CMV reactivation during dasatinib therapy. Expansion of CD56(neg) NK cells is a hallmark of chronic NK cell activation in patients treated with dasatinib and may predict a better clinical outcome. Furthermore, PD-1 blockade may enhance anti-leukemia responses of such NK cells.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Small-molecule splicing modulators have recently attracted considerable attention as a novel class of cancer therapeutics. CDC-like kinases (CLKs) are central to exon recognition in mRNA splicing and CLK inhibitors exhibit anti-tumour activities. Most importantly, molecular mechanism-based combination strategies for cancer therapy must be considered. However, it remains unclear whether CLK inhibitors modulate expression and splicing of apoptosis-related genes, and whether CLK inhibitors enhance cytotoxicity in combination with apoptosis inducers. Here we report an appropriate mechanism-based drug combination approach. Unexpectedly, we found that the CLK inhibitor T3 rapidly induced apoptosis in A2780 cells and G2/M cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. Regardless of the different phenotypes of the two cancer cell types, T3 decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, cFLIP and Mcl-1) for a short period of exposure and altered the splicing of the anti-apoptotic MCL1L and CFLAR isoform in A2780 and HCT116 cells. In contrast, other members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., Bcl-xL and Bcl-2) were resistant to T3-induced expression and splicing modulation. T3 and a Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitor synergistically induced apoptosis. Taken together, the use of a CLK inhibitor is a novel therapeutic approach to sensitise cancer cells to Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitors.",,"['Murai, Aiko', 'Ebara, Shunsuke', 'Sasaki, Satoshi', 'Ohashi, Tomohiro', 'Miyazaki, Tohru', 'Nomura, Toshiyuki', 'Araki, Shinsuke']","['Murai A', 'Ebara S', 'Sasaki S', 'Ohashi T', 'Miyazaki T', 'Nomura T', 'Araki S']","['Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Research, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Clk dual-specificity kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA Precursors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7567398,"[""In accordance with the journal's policy regarding conflicts of interest: AM, SE,"", 'SS, TO, TM, TN and SA are/were employees of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.

Methods: The DNA-TG assay was developed based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, with isotope-labeled TG-d3 and guanine-d3 as internal standards. This method was applied to 257 samples of pediatric ALL patients. The DNA-TG level was compared with erythrocyte TG nucleotide (RBC-TGN) level in relation to the TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes, which affect thiopurine metabolism, using Spearman's rank test and repeated measure ANOVA. Results: For DNA-TG quantification, a linearity range of 10.0-5,000.0 fmol TG/mug DNA; bias for accuracy of -10.4% -3.5%; coefficient of variation for intra- and inter-day precision of 3.4% and 5.8% at 80 fmol TG/mug DNA and of 4.9% and 5.3% at 800 fmol TG/mug DNA, respectively; and recovery of 85.7%-116.2% were achieved without matrix effects or carry-over. The median DNA-TG level in the 257 samples was 106.0 fmol TG/mug DNA (interquartile range, 75.8-150.9). There was a strong correlation between DNA-TG and RBC-TGN levels (rho=0.68, P<0.0001). The DNA-TG/RBC-TGN ratio was significantly higher in NUDT15 intermediate metabolizers (*1/*2 and *1/*3) than in patients with wild-type alleles (P<0.0001).

Mostly diagnosed in chronic phase (CML-CP), the disease progresses without treatment to accelerated phase (CML-AP) and finally to life-limiting blastic phase (CML-BP). Contrasting the therapy of other leukemia types, CML-CP is not treated by intense chemotherapy but with oral drugs -termed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)- for an unlimited duration. This therapy may be associated with general and developmental-specific side effects. The rarity of pediatric-CML is limiting the experience in assessment of the disability rating (DR) as an administrative health authority procedure. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent out evaluating the procedures and results associated with the application of a disabled person's pass. RESULTS: 34 out of 70 patients (49%; median age 11 yrs., range 3-17 yrs.; CML-CP/-AP/-BP: N= 28/3/3) replied to the questionnaire. Median duration of TKI therapy was 33 months (range 4-163) and associated in 71% (24/34) of the patients with side effects. 5/34 (15%) patients did not apply for a pass. DR 100 was assigned to all patients with CML-BP and to 2/3 patients with CML-AP; the 3(rd) patient was assigned DR 60. In the 21 patients with CML-CP the assigned DR varied from 20-100; 9/28 patients (32%) were assigned to DR 50. Special identifier label H (helpless) was assigned to 5/28 patients (18%) with CML-CP. CONCLUSION: Compared to other pediatric malignancies, the broad range of DR in CML-CP points to unsureness when assessing the limitations exerted by the disease and its therapy. Guidelines for adults with CML offer little orientation only as pediatric patients frequently suffer from developmental-specific side effects.",['Thieme.

In this study, recombinant human lactoferrin carrying humanized glycosylation (rhLf-h-glycan) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris SuperMan5, which is genetically glycoengineered to efficiently produce functional humanized glycoproteins inclosing (Man)5(GlcNAc)2 Asn-linked glycans, was analyzed, inspecting its potential toxicity against cancer cells. The live-cell differential nuclear staining assay was used to quantify the rhLf-h-glycan cytotoxicity, which was examined in four human cell lines: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) CCRF-CEM, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma SUP-T1, cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa, and as control, non-cancerous Hs27 cells. The defined CC50 values of rhLf-h-glycan in CCRF-CEM, SUP-T1, HeLa, and Hs27 cells were 144.45 +/- 4.44, 548.47 +/- 64.41, 350 +/- 14.82, and 3359.07 +/- 164 microg/mL, respectively. The rhLf-h-glycan exhibited a favorable selective cytotoxicity index (SCI), preferentially killing cancer cells: 23.25 for CCRF-CEM, 9.59 for HeLa, and 6.12 for SUP-T1, as compared with Hs27 cells. Also, rhLf-h-glycan showed significant antiproliferative activity (P < 0.0001) at 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation on CCRF-CEM cells. Additionally, it was observed via fluorescent staining and confocal microscopy that rhLf-h-glycan elicited apoptosis-associated morphological changes, such as blebbing, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic bodies in ALL cells. Furthermore, rhLf-h-glycan-treated HeLa cells revealed shrinkage of the microfilament structures, generating a speckled/punctuated pattern and also caused PARP-1 cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis. Moreover, in ALL cells, rhLf-h-glycan altered cell cycle progression inducing the G2/M phase arrest, and caused apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Overall, our findings revealed that rhLf-h-glycan has potential as an anticancer agent and therefore deserves further in vivo evaluation.",,"['Nakamura-Bencomo, Sayuri', 'Gutierrez, Denisse A', 'Robles-Escajeda, Elisa', 'Iglesias-Figueroa, Blanca', 'Siqueiros-Cendon, Tania S', 'Espinoza-Sanchez, Edward A', 'Arevalo-Gallegos, Sigifredo', 'Aguilera, Renato J', 'Rascon-Cruz, Quintin', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando']","['Nakamura-Bencomo S', 'Gutierrez DA', 'Robles-Escajeda E', 'Iglesias-Figueroa B', 'Siqueiros-Cendon TS', 'Espinoza-Sanchez EA', 'Arevalo-Gallegos S', 'Aguilera RJ', 'Rascon-Cruz Q', 'Varela-Ramirez A']","['Laboratorio de Biotecnologia I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua, Circuito Universitario s/n, Campus II, C.

Physical functions were assessed in terms of pain level, fatigue level, handgrip strength, and motor proficiency. Fine motor activities and lower extremity performance were assessed to determine activity limitations. Participation was assessed with a patient-reported questionnaire. Thirty children with ALL (mean age: 8.45 +/- 3.33 years) were included. Pain and fatigue level were mild. Poor handgrip strength was found; their mean handgrip strength was 60% of the normative. Fifty-six percent of the children had below-average motor performance. Participation scores were considerably high, except for sport and physical functioning sub-score. Participation level was positively associated with bilateral coordination and duration after diagnosis, while negatively correlated with pain and fatigue level (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The ICF-CY-based evaluation was useful to understand children's limitations in everyday life. Children with ALL need supportive interventions during treatments in terms of physical functioning and participation in activities. Children with ALL with higher pain and fatigue, poor bilateral coordination, and who were in earlier period after diagnosis had higher risk for participation restriction. What is Known: * Children with ALL had physical functioning limitations on treatments. * Participation restrictions were described in children with ALL off treatment. What is New: * The ICY-CY-based health and functioning evaluation allows health care professionals to globally determine limitations of everyday life in children with ALL on treatment. * Impairments in physical functions, pain severity, fatigue severity, and duration after diagnosis are associated with participation to everyday life in children with ALL on treatment.",,"['Yildiz Kabak, Vesile', 'Ipek, Fulya', 'Unal, Sule', 'Atasavun Uysal, Songul', 'Duger, Tulin']","['Yildiz Kabak V', 'Ipek F', 'Unal S', 'Atasavun Uysal S', 'Duger T']","['Hacettepe University Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, 06100, Ankara, Turkey. vesile_yldz@hotmail.com.', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Hacettepe University Faculty of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disability Evaluation', '*Disabled Children', 'Hand Strength', 'Humans', 'International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,,2020/10/17 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/10/16 05:58'],"['2020/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/16 05:58 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00431-020-03833-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00431-020-03833-y [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2021 Apr;180(4):1081-1088. doi: 10.1007/s00431-020-03833-y.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus may lead to implantation failure. The effect of diabetes and its therapeutic drugs on implantation is still largely unclear. Objective: To assess the endometrial expression changes of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), at the time of implantation in diabetic rats following treatment with Metformin and Pioglitazone. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight 6-8-wk-old Wistar female rats weighing 200-250 gr were divided into four groups (n = 7/each). Type 2 diabetes was induced and Metformin and Pioglitazone were applied for 4 wk. The expression of VEGFA and LIF was measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Results: The relative expression of VEGFA transcript was higher in the diabetic (p = 0.02) and Metformin-treated (p = 0.04) rats compared to the control group. Furthermore, the VEGFA transcript level significantly reduced in Pioglitazone-treated diabetic rats (p = 0.03). LIF expression was elevated in the Metformin- and the Pioglitazone-treated rats and reduced in the diabetic group in comparison with the control group. Compared to the diabetic rats, the expression of LIF was significantly elevated in the Metformin- (p = 0.01) and Pioglitazone-treated (p = 0.03) groups. Conclusion: The expressions of LIF and VEGFA were altered in diabetic rats during implantation which may be associated with diabetic-related infertility. Pioglitazone is able to restore the VEGFA and LIF expressions to their baseline levels more efficiently than Metformin.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Zarei et al.'],"['Zarei, Ronak', 'Aboutorabi, Roshanak', 'Rashidi, Bahman', 'Eskandari, Nahid', 'Nikpour, Parvaneh']","['Zarei R', 'Aboutorabi R', 'Rashidi B', 'Eskandari N', 'Nikpour P']","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Child Growth and Development Research Center, Research Institute for Primordial Prevention of Non-Communicable Disease, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Reprod Biomed,International journal of reproductive biomedicine,101679102,,,,PMC7521161,['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.'],2020/10/17 06:00,2020/10/17 06:01,['2020/10/16 05:57'],"['2019/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/16 05:57 [entrez]', '2020/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.18502/ijrm.v13i9.7666 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Reprod Biomed. 2020 Sep 20;18(9):713-722. doi: 10.18502/ijrm.v13i9.7666. eCollection 2020 Sep.,713-722,,20200920,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'Pioglitazone', 'Embryo implantation', 'Metformin', 'Rats', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor A']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, T cell exhaustion might lead to the possibility of immune escape of hematological malignancies. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells can restore the activity of exhausted T cell through reprogramming and is widely used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory (r/r) hematological malignancies. Of note, CD19, CD20, CD30, CD33, CD123, and CD269 as ideal targets have shown extraordinary potential for CAR-T cell therapy and other targets such as CD23 and SLAMF7 have brought promising future for clinical trials. However, CAR-T cells can also produce some adverse events after treatment of hematological malignancies, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and on-target/off-tumor toxicity, which may cause systemic immune stress inflammation, destruction of the blood-brain barrier, and even normal tissue damage. In this review, we aim to summarize the composition of CAR-T cell and its application in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Dynamic computational models may be instrumental for the comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying complex differentiation processes and provide novel prediction/intervention platforms to reinvigorate the system. Methods: By reconstructing a three-module regulatory network including genetic transcription, intracellular transduction, and microenvironment communication, we have investigated the early B lineage cell fate decisions in normal and pathological settings. The early B cell differentiation network was simulated as a Boolean model and then transformed, using fuzzy logic, to a continuous model. We tested null and overexpression mutants to analyze the emergent behavior of the network. Due to its importance in inflammation, we investigated the effect of NFkB induction at different early B cell differentiation stages. Results: While the exhaustive synchronous and asynchronous simulation of the early B cell regulatory network (eBCRN) reproduced the configurations of the hematopoietic progenitors and early B lymphoid precursors of the pathway, its simulation as a continuous model with fuzzy logics suggested a transient IL-7R(+) ProB-to-Pre-B subset expressing pre-BCR and a series of dominant B-cell transcriptional factors. This conspicuous differentiating cell population up-regulated CXCR7 and reduced CXCR4 and FoxO1 expression levels. Strikingly, constant but intermediate NFkB signaling at specific B cell differentiation stages allowed stabilization of an aberrant CXCR7(+) pre-B like phenotype with apparent affinity to proliferative signals, while under constitutive overactivation of NFkB, such cell phenotype was aberrantly exacerbated from the earliest stage of common lymphoid progenitors. Our mutant models revealed an abnormal delay in the BCR assembly upon NFkB activation, concomitant to sustained Flt3 signaling, down-regulation of Ebf1, Irf4 and Pax5 genes transcription, and reduced Ig recombination, pointing to a potential lineage commitment blockage. Discussion: For the first time, an inducible CXCR7(hi) B cell precursor endowed with the potential capability of shifting central lymphoid niches, is inferred by computational modeling. Its phenotype is compatible with that of leukemia-initiating cells and might be the foundation that bridges inflammation with blockage-related malignancies and a wide range of immunological diseases. Besides the predicted differentiation impairment, inflammation-inducible phenotypes open the possibility of newly formed niches colonized by the reported precursor. Thus, emergent bone marrow ecosystems are predicted following a pro-inflammatory induction, that may lead to hematopoietic instability associated to blockage pathologies.",['(c)2020 Enciso et al.'],"['Enciso, Jennifer', 'Mendoza, Luis', 'Alvarez-Buylla, Elena R', 'Pelayo, Rosana']","['Enciso J', 'Mendoza L', 'Alvarez-Buylla ER', 'Pelayo R']","['Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente, Delegacion Puebla, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Metepec, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Centro de Ciencias de la Complejidad, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Bioquimicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Ecologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente, Delegacion Puebla, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Metepec, Puebla, Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC7531334,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],2020/10/17 06:00,2020/10/17 06:01,['2020/10/16 05:55'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/16 05:55 [entrez]', '2020/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.9902 [doi]', '9902 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2020 Sep 29;8:e9902. doi: 10.7717/peerj.9902. eCollection 2020.,e9902,,20200929,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell development', 'Bone marrow', 'Boolean networks', 'CXCR7', 'Dynamical modeling', 'Early lymphoid precursor', 'Hematopoietic microenvironment', 'Inflammation', 'Lymphoid niche', 'NFkB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: A total of 27,833 AS events were detected in 8337 genes in 178 AML patients, with exon skip being the predominant type. Approximately 11% of the AS events were significantly related to prognosis, and the prediction models based on various events demonstrated high classification efficiencies. Splicing factors correlation networks further altered the diversity of AS events through epigenetic regulation and clarified the potential mechanism of the splicing pathway. Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed significant correlations between AS and immune features, molecular mutations, immune checkpoints and clinical outcome. The results suggested that AS clusters could be used to identify patient subgroups with different survival outcomes in AML, among which C1 was both associated with good outcome in overall survival. Interestingly, C1 was associated with lower immune scores compared with C2 and C3, and favorable-risk cytogenetics was rarely distributed in C2, but much more common in C1. Conclusions: This study revealed a comprehensive landscape of AS events, and provides new insight into molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy strategy for AML.",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],"['Zhang, Nan', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Chen, Ying', 'Lou, Shifeng', 'Zeng, Hanqing', 'Deng, Jianchuan']","['Zhang N', 'Zhang P', 'Chen Y', 'Lou S', 'Zeng H', 'Deng J']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 76 Linjiang Road, Chongqing, 400010 People's Republic of China.grid.412461.4"", 'Hematology Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010 China.grid.412461.4', ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 76 Linjiang Road, Chongqing, 400010 People's Republic of China.grid.412461.4"", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 76 Linjiang Road, Chongqing, 400010 People's Republic of China.grid.412461.4"", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 76 Linjiang Road, Chongqing, 400010 People's Republic of China.grid.412461.4"", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 76 Linjiang Road, Chongqing, 400010 People's Republic of China.grid.412461.4""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,PMC7552347,['Competing interestsThe author reports no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2020/10/17 06:00,2020/10/17 06:01,['2020/10/16 05:54'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/16 05:54 [entrez]', '2020/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-020-00481-5 [doi]', '481 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2020 Oct 12;10:118. doi: 10.1186/s13578-020-00481-5. eCollection 2020.,118,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9927-579X'],20201012,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Alternative splicing', 'Genome-wide analysis', 'Microenvironment', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the cytotoxicity of the methanol extract (HRB), fractions (HRBa, HRBb, and HRBa1-5), and compounds from the bark of Hypericum roeperianum (HRB) was evaluated towards a panel of 9 cancer cell lines. The mode of action of the HRB and trichadonic acid (1) was also studied. Column chromatography was applied to isolate the constituents of HRB. The cytotoxicity of botanicals and phytochemicals was evaluated by the resazurin reduction assay (RRA). Caspase-Glo assay was used to evaluate the activity of caspases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA) were assessed by flow cytometry. Phytochemicals isolated from HRB were trichadonic acid (1), fridelan-3-one (2), 2-hydroxy-5-methoxyxanthone (3), norathyriol (4), 1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (5), betulinic acid (6), 3'-hydroxymethyl-2'-(4''-hydroxy-3'',5''-dimethoxyphenyl)-5',6':5,6-(6,8-dihydrox yxanthone)-1',4'-dioxane (7), and 3'-hydroxymethyl-2'-(4''-hydroxy-3'',5''-dimethoxyphenyl)-5',6':5,6-(xanthone)-1' ,4'-dioxane (8).

The recorded IC50 values ranged from 11.43 microg/mL (against the P-glycoprotein (gp)-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) to 26.75 microg/mL (against HCT116 (p53(+/+)) colon adenocarcinoma cells) for the crude extract HRB. Compounds 1, 5, and doxorubicin displayed cytotoxic effects towards the 9 tested cancer cell lines with IC50 values varying from 14.44 microM (against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 44.20 microM (against the resistant HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells) for 1 and from 38.46 microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 112.27 microM (against the resistant HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells) for 5. HRB and compound 1 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells. The apoptotic process was mediated by enhanced ROS production for HRB or via caspases activation and enhanced ROS production for compound 1.

Our previous microarray analysis indicated miR-550-1 was significantly downregulated in AML. The specific biological roles of miR-550-1 and its indirect interactions and regulation of m(6)A in AML, however, remain poorly understood. At the present study, we found that miR-550-1 was significantly down-regulated in primary AML samples from human patients, likely owing to hypermethylation of the associated CpG islands. When miR-550-1 expression was induced, it impaired AML cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, thus suppressing tumor development. When ectopically expressed, miR-550-1 drove the G0/1 cell cycle phase arrest, differentiation, and apoptotic death of affected cells. We confirmed mechanistically that WW-domain containing transcription regulator-1 (WWTR1) gene was a downstream target of miR-550-1. Moreover, we also identified Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), a vital component of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex, as a target of miR-550-1. These data indicated that miR-550-1 might mediate a decrease in m(6)A levels via targeting WTAP, which led to a further reduction in WWTR1 stability. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we were able to determine that miR-550-1 disrupted the proliferation and tumorigenesis of AML cells at least in part via the direct targeting of WWTR1. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that miR-550-1 acts as a tumor suppressor in the context of AML pathogenesis, suggesting that efforts to bolster miR-550-1 expression in AML patients may thus be a viable clinical strategy to improve patient outcomes.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Hu, Chao', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Li, Chenying', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Li, Xia', 'Ulrich, Bryan', 'Su, Rui', 'Dong, Lei', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Jiang, Xi', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Jin, Jie']","['Hu C', 'Yu M', 'Li C', 'Wang Y', 'Li X', 'Ulrich B', 'Su R', 'Dong L', 'Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Jiang X', 'Chen J', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, P.R.

However, association of T-LGLL with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is extremely rare. Here, we describe a case of an 80-year-old man admitted with suspected Felty's syndrome. The blood count showed white blood cells at 2.2x10(9)/L, with 3% neutrophils, 88% lymphocytes, and at 0.66x10(9)/L LGLs. The spleen had been removed 43 months prior to the admission due to suspected B-cell splenic lymphoma. Re-examination of the spleen revealed cyclin D1+ and SOX11- lymphocytes in the inner part of the unexpanded mantle zones of the white pulp follicles, thus displaying a so-called in situ histologic pattern of MCL, and in small clusters in the red pulp. The splenic cords were moderately expanded by lymphocytes expressing CD3, TIA1, and granzyme B but not CD4 and CD8. Monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and the T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma and delta chain genes, polyclonal rearrangements of the TCR beta chain gene, mutation of the signal transducer and activator of transctiption 3 gene (c.1940A>T; p.N647I), and t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation were identified in the spleen sample. Flow cytometry of bone marrow revealed a population of TCR gammadelta+, CD3+, CD4-, CD5-, CD7+, CD8-, CD16-, CD56-, and CD57- lymphocytes. Fragment analysis demonstrated identical TCR gene clonal rearrangement patterns in the spleen and bone marrow samples. In this study, we describe the first case of simultaneous presentation of gammadelta T-LGLL and leukemic non-nodal MCL (L-NN-MCL) in a patient with RA and present morphological findings of L-NN-MCL in the spleen.",['(c) 2020 Gorodetskiy et al.'],"['Gorodetskiy, Vadim R', 'Probatova, Natalya A', 'Kupryshina, Natalia A', 'Palshina, Svetlana G', 'Obukhova, Tatiana N', 'Sidorova, Yulia V', 'Ryzhikova, Natalya V', 'Sudarikov, Andrey B']","['Gorodetskiy VR', 'Probatova NA', 'Kupryshina NA', 'Palshina SG', 'Obukhova TN', 'Sidorova YV', 'Ryzhikova NV', 'Sudarikov AB']","['Department of Intensive Methods of Therapy, V.A.

PI3K is one of the most important kinases at the crossroad to the B-cell receptor and cytokine receptor which play a key role in CLL cell survival, proliferation and migration. Idelalisib is the first in class PI3Kdelta inhibitor approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL in combination with rituximab. Idelalisib activity in heavily treated patients is balanced by recurrent adverse events which limit its long-term use. These limitations prompt the investigation on novel PI3K inhibitors, also targeting different protein isoforms, and alternative schedule strategies. In this regard, duvelisib is the only PI3K gamma and delta inhibitor approved as single agent for relapsed CLL. In this review, we will address novel insights on PI3K structure, isoforms, regulating signaling and the most updated data of next-generation PI3K inhibitors in CLL.",['(c) 2020 Visentin et al.'],"['Visentin, Andrea', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Severin, Filippo', 'Imbergamo, Silvia', 'Pravato, Stefano', 'Romano Gargarella, Leila', 'Manni, Sabrina', 'Pizzo, Serena', 'Ruggieri, Edoardo', 'Facco, Monica', 'Brunati, Anna Maria', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Visentin A', 'Frezzato F', 'Severin F', 'Imbergamo S', 'Pravato S', 'Romano Gargarella L', 'Manni S', 'Pizzo S', 'Ruggieri E', 'Facco M', 'Brunati AM', 'Semenzato G', 'Piazza F', 'Trentin L']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC7532889,"['LT and FP won Italian Gilead fellowship program.

Here, we studied the impact of calcipotriol, a vitamin D3 analogue, on the activation of human pancreatic CAFs and T cells using 2- and 3-dimensional (2D, 3D) cell culture models. We found that calcipotriol decreased CAF proliferation and migration and reduced the release of the pro-tumorigenic factors prostaglandin E2, IL-6, periostin, and leukemia inhibitory factor. However, calcipotriol promoted PD-L1 upregulation, which could influence T cell mediated tumour immune surveillance. Calcipotriol reduced T cell proliferation and production of IFN-gamma, granzyme B and IL-17, but increased IL-10 secretion. These effects were even more profound in the presence of CAFs in 2D cultures and in the presence of CAFs and pancreatic tumour cell line (PANC-1) spheroids in 3D cultures. Functional assays on tumour infiltrating lymphocytes also showed a reduction in T cell activation by calcipotriol. This suggests that calcipotriol reduces the tumour supportive activity of CAFs but at the same time reduces T cell effector functions, which could compromise the patients' tumour immune surveillance. Thus, vitamin D3 analogues appear to have dual functions in the context of pancreatic cancer, which could have important clinical implications.",,"['Gorchs, Laia', 'Ahmed, Sultan', 'Mayer, Chante', 'Knauf, Alisa', 'Fernandez Moro, Carlos', 'Svensson, Mattias', 'Heuchel, Rainer', 'Rangelova, Elena', 'Bergman, Peter', 'Kaipe, Helen']","['Gorchs L', 'Ahmed S', 'Mayer C', 'Knauf A', 'Fernandez Moro C', 'Svensson M', 'Heuchel R', 'Rangelova E', 'Bergman P', 'Kaipe H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. laia.gorchs@ki.se.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathology/Cytology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Centre for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Pancreatic Surgery Unit, Centre for Digestive Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Infectious Disease Clinic, The Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. helen.kaipe@ki.se.', 'Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. helen.kaipe@ki.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['143NQ3779B (calcipotriene)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreas/*immunology/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Young Adult']",PMC7562723,,2020/10/17 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/10/16 05:44'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/16 05:44 [entrez]', '2020/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-74368-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-74368-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Oct 15;10(1):17444. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-74368-3.,17444,,20201015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with ALL and 35 non-ALL controls recruited in this study were genotyped utilizing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. RESULTS: The MTHFR 677CT genotype was significantly more frequently found in patients with ALL having a 2-fold increase in risk (P <0.01).

The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis of PRES was 8.95+/-3.66 years. Most patients (80.4%) had a primary diagnosis of acute leukemia. Patients received chemotherapy (71.4%) and/or used steroids within 14 days before the diagnosis of PRES (85.7%). Hypertension was found in 83.9% of the patients. Twenty-six patients had infections and 22 of them had febrile neutropenia. The most common electrolyte disorders were hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypopotassemia. Six patients had tumor lysis syndrome and 4 had inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging was used for diagnosis in all patients. The most commonly involved regions by magnetic resonance imaging were occipital (58%), parietal (51%), and frontal lobes (45%), respectively. Twenty-five patients required intensive care and 7 patients were intubated. In conclusion, PRES may develop during the follow-up and treatment of hematological diseases. In addition to steroid and intense combined chemotherapies, immunosuppressive agents and hypertension are also factors that may be responsible for PRES.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Patients reaching undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) after 12 cycles of IV are randomised 1:2 to continue ibrutinib or stop treatment. The persistence of uMRD after stopping IV is studied. In addition, in patients who become positive for MRD again after stopping, IV treatment is reinitiated. The efficacy of this approach with regard to progression-free survival 12 months after randomisation is the primary endpoint of the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol respects the Helsinki declaration and has been approved by the ethical committee of the Amsterdam Medical Center. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed papers. All patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and no-exclusion criteria, and have signed the informed consent form are included in the study.

The present study compared the effect of chemotherapy with unmanipulated haplo-HSCT as treatment of patients with IR-AML in first complete remission (CR1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 80 children with IR-AML and compared the effects of chemotherapy (n = 47) with those of haplo-HSCT (n = 33) as treatment in CR1. RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival, event-free survival (EFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 85.4% +/- 4.1%, 73.2% +/- 5.0%, and 25.4% +/- 4.5%, respectively. Compared with the chemotherapy group, the patients in the haplo-HSCT group had a lower CIR (P = .059) and better EFS (P = .108), but roughly equivalent overall survival (P = .841). Multivariate analysis revealed chemotherapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) of >/= 10(-3) after induction therapy as independent risk factors affecting CIR and EFS. EFS (P = .045) and CIR (P = .045) differed significantly between the 2 treatment groups in patients with MRD of >/= 10(-3) after induction therapy. CONCLUSION: Haplo-HSCT might be a feasible option for children with IR-AML in CR1, especially for patients with MRD of >/= 10(-3) after induction therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Cytarabine (ara-C) is currently the main drug used to treat AML patients and is usually combined with different chemotherapeutic agents. However, due to resistance to ara-C, a new combination is needed to reduce ara-C resistance and improve treatment outcome. As is known to all, ginseng is a traditional Chinese herb; compound K is the principal metabolic product of ginsenoside which also has anti-cancer activity in some cancer cells, while the mechanism is unclear. In our previous study, we found that compound K inhibited AML cell viability and induced apoptosis, and compound K combined with ara-C synergistically induced AML cell proliferation arrest. Thus, we sought to investigate the reason for this by focusing on the mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage. In this paper, our results provide a foundation for the clinical evaluation of concomitant administration of compound K and ara-C in order to reduce the resistance to ara-C and improve AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Karyotypes are recorded as text written in the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). Downstream analysis of karyotypes is conducted manually, due to the visual nature of analysis and the linguistic structure of the ISCN. The ISCN has not been computer-readable and, as such, prevents the full potential of these genomic data from being realized. In response, we developed CytoGPS, a platform to analyze large volumes of cytogenetic data using a Loss-Gain-Fusion model that converts the human-readable ISCN karyotypes into a machine-readable binary format. As proof of principle, we applied CytoGPS to cytogenetic data from the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer, a National Cancer Institute hosted database of over 69,000 karyotypes of human cancers. Using the Jaccard coefficient to determine similarity between karyotypes structured as binary vectors, we were able to identify novel patterns from 4,968 Mitelman CML karyotypes, such as the co-occurrence of trisomy 19 and 21.

Of the 31 patients who had had an antecedent malignancy, 14 (45 %) had had breast cancer or DCIS and 22 (71 %) had received anthracycline-based systemic chemotherapy.

To determine its impact on leukaemic haematopoiesis, we induced acute or chronic myeloid leukaemias (AML or CML) in mice by enforced expression of MLL-AF9 or BCR-ABL, respectively, in Tgif1(+/+) or Tgif1(-/-) haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and transplanted them into syngeneic recipients. We find that loss of Tgif1 accelerates leukaemic progression and shortens survival in mice with either AML or CML. Leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) occur with higher frequency in AML among mice transplanted with MLL-AF9-transduced Tgif1(-/-) HSPCs than with Tgif1(+/+) BMCs. Moreover, AML in mice generated with Tgif1(-/-) HSPCs are chemotherapy resistant and relapse more rapidly than those whose AML arose in Tgif1(+/+) HSPCs. Whole transcriptome analysis shows significant alterations in gene expression profiles associated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and retinoic acid (RA) signalling pathways because of Tgif1 loss. These findings indicate that Tgif1 has a protective role in myeloid leukaemia initiation and progression, and its anti-leukaemic contributions are connected to TGF-beta- and RA-driven functions.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

However, clonality testing in these cases has often not been supportive of neoplasia. HYPOTHESIS: English bulldogs have a syndrome of nonneoplastic B-cell expansion. ANIMALS: Eighty-four English bulldogs with small-sized CD21+ B-cell lymphocytosis in the blood as determined by flow cytometry. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. We characterized this syndrome by assessing B-cell clonality, clinical presentation, flow cytometric features, and immunoglobulin gammopathy patterns. We identified 84 cases with CD21+ lymphocytosis among 195 English bulldogs with blood samples submitted to the Colorado State University-Clinical Immunology laboratory for immunophenotyping between 2010 and 2019. Flow cytometry features were compared to normal B-cells and BCLL cases. PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) by multiple immunoglobulin primers was performed to assess B-cell clonality. A subset of cases with gammopathy were examined by protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and immunoglobulin subclass ELISA quantification. RESULTS: Seventy percent (58/83) of cases had polyclonal or restricted polyclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, suggesting nonmalignant B-cell expansion. The median age of all dogs in the study was 6.8 years and 74% were male. The median (range) lymphocyte count was 22 400/muL (2000-384 400/muL) and B-cells had low expression of class II MHC and CD25. Splenomegaly or splenic masses were detected in 57% (26/46) of cases and lymphadenopathy in 11% (7/61). Seventy-one percent (52/73) of cases had hyperglobulinemia and 77% (23/30) with globulin characterization had IgA +/- IgM polyclonal or restricted polyclonal gammopathy patterns. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in English bulldogs is characterized by low B-cell class II MHC and CD25 expression, splenomegaly and hyperglobulinemia consisting of increased IgA +/- IgM. We hypothesize that this syndrome has a genetic basis.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

To investigate the regulatory role of CTCF boundary in aberrant HOX gene expression and the therapeutic sensitivity of BETi in AML, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to delete 47 base pairs of the CTCF binding motif which is located between HOXA7 and HOXA9 genes (CBS7/9) in different subtypes of AML with either MLL-rearrangement or NPM1 mutation. Our results revealed that HOXA9 is significantly downregulated in response to the CBS7/9 deletion. Moreover, CBS7/9 boundary deletion sensitized the BETi treatment reaction in both MOLM-13 and OCI-AML3 cells. To further examine whether BETi therapeutic sensitivity in AML is depended on the expression level of the HOXA9 gene, we overexpressed the HOXA9 in the CBS7/9 deleted AML cell lines, which can rescue and restore the resistance to BETi treatment of the CBS7/9 KO cells by activating MAPK signaling pathway. Deletion of CBS7/9 specifically decreased the recruitment of BRD4 and RNA pol II to the posterior HOXA genes, in which, a transcription elongation factor ELL3 is the key factor in regulating HOXA gene transcription monitored by CBS7/9 chromatin boundary.

Herein, we aimed to characterize the immune landscape of TP53-mutated AML and determine whether TP53 abnormalities identify a patient subgroup that may benefit from immunotherapy with flotetuzumab, an investigational CD123 x CD3 bispecific dual-affinity retargeting antibody (DART) molecule. The NanoString PanCancer IO360 assay was used to profile 64 diagnostic bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with TP53-mutated (n = 42) and TP53-wild-type (TP53-WT) AML (n = 22) and 45 BM samples from patients who received flotetuzumab for relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML (15 cases with TP53 mutations and/or 17p deletion). The comparison between TP53-mutated and TP53-WT primary BM samples showed higher expression of IFNG, FOXP3, immune checkpoints, markers of immune senescence, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt and NF-kappaB signaling intermediates in the former cohort and allowed the discovery of a 34-gene immune classifier prognostic for survival in independent validation series. Finally, 7 out of 15 patients (47%) with R/R AML and TP53 abnormalities showed complete responses to flotetuzumab (<5% BM blasts) on the CP-MGD006-01 clinical trial (NCT #02152956) and had significantly higher tumor inflammation signature, FOXP3, CD8, inflammatory chemokine, and PD1 gene expression scores at baseline compared with nonresponders. Patients with TP53 abnormalities who achieved a complete response experienced prolonged survival (median, 10.3 months; range, 3.3-21.3 months). These results encourage further study of flotetuzumab immunotherapy in patients with TP53-mutated AML.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Vadakekolathu, Jayakumar', 'Lai, Catherine', 'Reeder, Stephen', 'Church, Sarah E', 'Hood, Tressa', 'Lourdusamy, Anbarasu', 'Rettig, Michael P', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Godwin, John', 'Wieduwilt, Matthew J', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Muth, John', 'Yau, Tung On', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Sweet, Kendra', 'Altmann, Heidi', 'Foulds, Gemma A', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Middeke, Jan Moritz', 'Ciciarello, Marilena', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Davidson-Moncada, Jan K', 'Rutella, Sergio']","['Vadakekolathu J', 'Lai C', 'Reeder S', 'Church SE', 'Hood T', 'Lourdusamy A', 'Rettig MP', 'Aldoss I', 'Advani AS', 'Godwin J', 'Wieduwilt MJ', 'Arellano M', 'Muth J', 'Yau TO', 'Ravandi F', 'Sweet K', 'Altmann H', 'Foulds GA', 'Stolzel F', 'Middeke JM', 'Ciciarello M', 'Curti A', 'Valk PJM', 'Lowenberg B', 'Gojo I', 'Bornhauser M', 'DiPersio JF', 'Davidson-Moncada JK', 'Rutella S']","['John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', ""MedStar Georgetown University Hospital's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC."", 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA.', 'School of Medicine, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Earle A.

We recently reported that tumor cell lines and patient specimens from adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) are susceptible to specific cell death by visible light exposure after a short-term culture with 5-aminolevulinic acid, indicating that extracorporeal photopheresis could eradicate hematological tumor cells circulating in peripheral blood. As a bridge from basic research to clinical trial of PDT for hematological malignancies, we here examined the efficacy of ALA-PDT on various lymphoid malignancies with circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood. We also examined the effects of ALA-PDT on tumor cells before and after conventional chemotherapy. With 16 primary blood samples from 13 patients, we demonstrated that PDT efficiently killed tumor cells without influencing normal lymphocytes in aggressive diseases such as acute ATL. Importantly, PDT could eradicate acute ATL cells remaining after standard chemotherapy or anti-CCR4 antibody, suggesting that PDT could work together with other conventional therapies in a complementary manner. The responses of PDT on indolent tumor cells were various but were clearly depending on accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, which indicates the possibility of biomarker-guided application of PDT.

Here, we discovered that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), itself a cap-binding protein, drives the expression of the capping machinery and increased capping efficiency of approximately 100 coding and noncoding RNAs. To quantify this, we developed enzymatic (cap quantification; CapQ) and quantitative cap immunoprecipitation (CapIP) methods. The CapQ method has the further advantage that it captures information about capping status independent of the type of 5' cap, i.e., it is not restricted to informing on m(7)G caps. These methodological advances led to unanticipated revelations: 1) Many RNA populations are inefficiently capped at steady state ( approximately 30 to 50%), and eIF4E overexpression increased this to approximately 60 to 100%, depending on the RNA; 2) eIF4E physically associates with noncoding RNAs in the nucleus; and 3) approximately half of eIF4E-capping targets identified are noncoding RNAs. eIF4E's association with noncoding RNAs strongly positions it to act beyond translation. Coding and noncoding capping targets have activities that influence survival, cell morphology, and cell-to-cell interaction. Given that RNA export and translation machineries typically utilize capped RNA substrates, capping regulation provides means to titrate the protein-coding capacity of the transcriptome and, for noncoding RNAs, to regulate their activities. We also discovered a cap sensitivity element (CapSE) which conferred eIF4E-dependent capping sensitivity. Finally, we observed elevated capping for specific RNAs in high-eIF4E leukemia specimens, supporting a role for cap dysregulation in malignancy. In all, levels of capping RNAs can be regulated by eIF4E.",['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Several studies comparing Haplo-SCT and MUD-SCT have reported inconsistent clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to synthesize the existing evidence regarding outcomes of stem cell transplantations comparing Haplo-SCT with MUD-SCT. METHODS: We searched for titles of articles in MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane library, EMBASE database that compared transplantation with Haplo-SCT versus MUD-SCT. To compare clinical outcomes between Haplo-SCT and MUD-SCT, we performed a meta-analysis of 17 studies and reported the pooled odd ratios (OR) of 6 endpoints including overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse rate (RR), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and chronic graft- versus-host disease (cGVHD). RESULTS: We found that Haplo-SCT was associated with a comparable OS (pooled OR of 0.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.86-1.14), PFS (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88-1.15), NRM (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65-1.04) and RR (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95-1.22) compared to MUD-SCT. We also found a significantly decreased risk of aGVHD (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.88) and cGVHD (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38-0.66) in Haplo-SCT group. CONCLUSION: Results of this meta-analysis demonstrates that Haplo-SCT achieves comparable clinical outcomes compared to MUD-SCT in terms of OS, PFS, TRM and RR, but is better than MUD-SCT in terms of decreased aGVHD and cGVHD risk. Haplo-SCT is a valid option for patient needing urgent transplantation.",,"['Ma, Liyuan', 'Han, Xue', 'Jiang, Suyu', 'Meng, Qingqi', 'Zhang, Liubo', 'Bao, Hongyu']","['Ma L', 'Han X', 'Jiang S', 'Meng Q', 'Zhang L', 'Bao H']","[""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121# Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121# Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121# Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121# Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121# Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 121# Jiangjiayuan Road, Nanjing 210011, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Systematic Review', 'Video-Audio Media']",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/therapy', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Transplantation Conditioning', '*Unrelated Donors']",,,2020/10/16 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/10/15 17:08'],"['2020/10/15 17:08 [entrez]', '2020/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1831292 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):356-365. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1831292.,356-365,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'acute leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'hematologic malignancies', 'lymphoma', 'matched related donor transplantation', 'matched unrelated donor transplantation', 'meta-analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further investigations show that knockdown of LINC00467 inhibits the malignant phenotypes of AML cells. Consistently, LINC00467 knockdown slows AML progression in immunodeficient mice. Interestingly, microRNA-339 (miR-339) is upregulated and its target gene SKI, an oncogene, is downregulated in AML cells after LINC00467 knockdown. More importantly, inhibition of miR-339 can largely abolish the effect of LINC00467 knockdown on AML cells.

IKZF1 deletions and CRLF2 expression were assessed in bone marrow samples from 117 children with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL. Sixteen (13.7%) patients were found to harbor IKZF1 deletions, which was associated with inferior outcomes. The event-free survival (EFS) for patients with high -CRLF2 expression was significantly worse than that for low -CRLF2 expression.

As a result, ULF LC-FAIMS-MS brought unprecedented sensitivity levels and high reproducibility in bottom-up proteomic profiling. In addition, FAIMS improved the dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratios, and detection limits in ULF LC-MS-based measurements by significantly reducing chemical noise in comparison to the conventional nanoESI interface used with the same ULF LC-MS setup. Two, three, or four compensation voltages separated by at least 15 V were tested within a single LC-MS run using the FAIMS interface. The optimized ULF LC-ESI-FAIMS-MS/MS conditions resulted in identification of 2,348 +/- 42 protein groups, 10,062 +/- 285 peptide groups, and 15,734 +/- 350 peptide-spectrum matches for 1 ng of a HeLa digest, using a 1 h gradient at the flow rate of 12 nL/min, which represents an increase by 38%, 91%, and 131% in respective identifications, as compared to the control experiment (without FAIMS). To evaluate the practical utility of the ULF LC-ESI-FAIMS-MS platform in proteomic profiling of limited samples, approximately 100, 1,000, and 10,000 U937 myeloid leukemia cells were processed, and a one-tenth of each sample was analyzed. Using the optimized conditions, we were able to reliably identify 251 +/- 54, 1,135 +/- 80, and 2,234 +/- 25 protein groups from injected aliquots corresponding to approximately 10, 100, and 1,000 processed cells.",,"['Gregus, Michal', 'Kostas, James C', 'Ray, Somak', 'Abbatiello, Susan E', 'Ivanov, Alexander R']","['Gregus M', 'Kostas JC', 'Ray S', 'Abbatiello SE', 'Ivanov AR']","['Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.', 'Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.', 'Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.', 'Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.', 'Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave., Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA218500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM120272/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM136421/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,IM,"['Chromatography, Liquid/*methods', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Limit of Detection', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Nanotechnology', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Time Factors']",PMC7934643,,2020/10/16 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/10/15 17:04'],"['2020/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/15 17:04 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03262 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2020 Nov 3;92(21):14702-14712. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03262.

In vivo, LV-10 cells do not cause graft vs host disease while mediating graft vs leukemia (GvL) effect against adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since pediatric AML (pAML) and adult AML are different on a genetic and epigenetic level, we investigate herein whether LV-10 cells also efficiently kill pAML cells. We show that the majority of primary pAML are killed by LV-10 cells, with different levels of sensitivity to killing. Transcriptionally, pAML sensitive to LV-10 killing expressed a myeloid maturation signature. Overlaying the signatures of sensitive and resistant pAML onto the public NCI TARGET pAML dataset revealed that sensitive pAML clustered with M5 monocytic pAML and pAML with MLL rearrangement. Resistant pAML clustered with myelomonocytic leukemias and those bearing the core binding factor translocations inv(16) or t(8;21)(RUNX1-RUNX1T1). Furthermore, resistant pAML upregulated the membrane glycoprotein CD200, which binds to the inhibitory receptor CD200R1 on LV-10 cells. To examine if CD200 expression on target cells can impair LV-10 cell function, we overexpressed CD200 in myeloid leukemia cell lines ordinarily sensitive to LV-10 killing. Indeed, LV-10 cells degranulated less and killed fewer CD200-overexpressing cells compared to controls, indicating that pAML can utilize CD200 expression for immune evasion. Altogether, the majority of pAML are killed by LV-10 cells in vitro, supporting further LV-10 cell development as an innovative cell therapy for pAML.",,"['Cieniewicz, Brandon', 'Uyeda, Molly Javier', 'Chen, Ping Pauline', 'Sayitoglu, Ece Canan', 'Liu, Jeffrey Mao-Hwa', 'Andolfi, Grazia', 'Greenthal, Katharine', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Gregori, Silvia', 'Bacchetta, Rosa', 'Lacayo, Norman James', 'Cepika, Alma-Martina', 'Roncarolo, Maria Grazia']","['Cieniewicz B', 'Uyeda MJ', 'Chen PP', 'Sayitoglu EC', 'Liu JM', 'Andolfi G', 'Greenthal K', 'Bertaina A', 'Gregori S', 'Bacchetta R', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Cepika AM', 'Roncarolo MG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Milan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Milan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford. mg1@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Child', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', '*T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC8485690,,2020/10/16 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/10/15 10:30'],"['2020/09/28 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/15 10:30 [entrez]', '2020/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.263129 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Oct 1;106(10):2588-2597. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.263129.,2588-2597,,20211001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the early promise of differentiation therapy did not translate into clinical benefit for other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia, in which cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens remained the standard of care. Recent advances, including insights from sequencing of acute myeloid leukemia genomes, have led to the development of targeted therapies, comprising agents that induce differentiation of leukemic cells in preclinical models and clinical trials, thus rejuvenating interest in differentiation therapy. These agents act on various cellular processes including dysregulated metabolic programs, signaling pathways, epigenetic machinery and the cell cycle. In particular, inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 and FLT3 have shown clinical benefit, leading to approval by regulatory bodies of their use. Besides the focus on recently approved differentiation therapies, this review also provides an overview of differentiation- inducing agents being tested in clinical trials or investigated in preclinical research. Combinatorial strategies are currently being tested for several agents (inhibitors of KDM1A, DOT1L, BET proteins, histone deacetylases), which were not effective in clinical studies as single agents, despite encouraging anti-leukemic activity observed in preclinical models.

We conducted a non-randomized, phase II, single-arm study to determine the efficacy of eltrombopag for patients with CML or MF with persistent thrombocytopenia while on TKI or ruxolitinib. Eltrombopag was initiated at 50 mg/day, with dose escalation up to 300 mg daily allowed every 2 weeks. Twenty-one patients were enrolled (CML=15, MF=6); median age 60 years (range, 31-97 years). The median platelet count was 44x109/L (range, 3-49x109/L) in CML and 62x109/L (range, 21-75x109/L) in MF. After a median of 18 months (range, 5-77 months), 12/15 patients with CML achieved complete platelet response. The median peak platelet count among responders was 154x109/L (range, 74-893x109/L). Among CML patients 5 could re-escalate the TKI dose and 9 improved their response. None of the 6 patients with MF had a sustained response. Therapy was generally well tolerated. One patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity (elevated transaminases). One patient with CML developed significant thrombocytosis (>1000x109/L).

We aimed to determine the reactive or neoplastic origin of pDCs in pDC-AML, and their link with the CD34+ blasts, monocytes or conventional DCs (cDCs) associated in the same sample, by phenotypic and molecular analyses (targeted NGS, 70 genes). We compared 15 pDC-AML at diagnosis with 21 BPDCN and 11 normal pDCs from healthy donors. CD45low CD34+ blasts were found in all cases (10-80% of medullar cells), associated with pDCs (4-36%), monocytes in 14 cases (1-10%) and cDCs (2 cases, 4.8-19%). pDCs in pDC-AML harbor a clearly different phenotype from BPDCN: CD4+ CD56- in 100% of cases, most frequently CD303+, CD304+ and CD34+; lower expression of cTCL1 and CD123 with isolated lymphoid markers (CD22/CD7/CD5) in some cases, suggesting a pre-pDC stage. In all cases, pDCs, monocytes and cDC are neoplastic since they harbor the same mutations as CD34+ blasts. RUNX1 is the most commonly mutated gene: detected in all AML with minimal differentiation (M0-AML) but not in the other cases. Despite low number of cases, the systematic association between M0-AML, RUNX1 mutations and an excess of pDC is puzzling. Further evaluation in a larger cohort is required to confirm RUNX1 mutations in pDC-AML with minimal differentiation and to investigate whether it represents a proliferation of blasts with macrophage and DC progenitor potential.",,"['Zalmai, Loria', 'Viailly, Pierre-Julien', 'Biichle, Sabeha', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Soret, Lou', 'Angelot-Delettre, Fanny', 'Petrella, Tony', 'Collonge-Rame, Marie-Agnes', 'Seilles, Estelle', 'Geffroy, Sandrine', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Daguindau, Etienne', 'Bouyer, Sabrina', 'Dindinaud, Elodie', 'Baunin, Victor', 'Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Wagner-Ballon, Orianne', 'Salaun, Veronique', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Brun, Sophie', 'Drenou, Bernard', 'Mayeur-Rousse, Caroline', 'Okamba, Patricia', 'Dorvaux, Veronique', 'Tichionni, Michel', 'Rose, Johann', 'Rubio, Marie Therese', 'Jacob, Marie Christine', 'Raggueneau, Victoria', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Saas, Philippe', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Adotevi, Olivier', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Jardin, Fabrice', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Renosi, Florian']","['Zalmai L', 'Viailly PJ', 'Biichle S', 'Cheok M', 'Soret L', 'Angelot-Delettre F', 'Petrella T', 'Collonge-Rame MA', 'Seilles E', 'Geffroy S', 'Deconinck E', 'Daguindau E', 'Bouyer S', 'Dindinaud E', 'Baunin V', 'Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Roos-Weil D', 'Wagner-Ballon O', 'Salaun V', 'Feuillard J', 'Brun S', 'Drenou B', 'Mayeur-Rousse C', 'Okamba P', 'Dorvaux V', 'Tichionni M', 'Rose J', 'Rubio MT', 'Jacob MC', 'Raggueneau V', 'Preudhomme C', 'Saas P', 'Ferrand C', 'Adotevi O', 'Roumier C', 'Jardin F', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Renosi F']","[""Service d'hematologie biologique, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris."", 'INSERM U1245, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen.', 'Univ.

We conducted a multicenter phase II clinical trial (NCT01920737) investigating a pediatric-inspired regimen, based on the augmented arm of the Children's Cancer Group 1882 protocol, incorporating 6 doses of pegaspargase 2000 IU/m2, rationally synchronized to avoid overlapping toxicity with other agents. We treated 39 adults ages 20-60 years (median, 38 years) with newly-diagnosed ALL (n=31) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (n=8). Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred frequently and at higher rates in patients 40-60 (n=18) vs 18-39 (n=21) years (44 vs 10%, p=0.025). However, 8/9 patients re-challenged with pegaspargase did not experience recurrent grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia. Grade 3-4 hypertriglyceridemia and hypofibrinogenemia were common (each 59%). Asparaginase activity at 7-days post-infusion reflected levels associated with adequate asparagine depletion, even among those with antibodies to pegaspargase. Complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery was observed post-induction in 38/39 (97%) patients. Among patients with ALL, rates of MRD negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry were 33% and 83% following Induction Phase I and Phase II, respectively. Event-free and overall survival at 3 years (67.8 and 76.4%) compare favorably to outcomes observed in other series. These results demonstrate pegaspargase can be administered in the context of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy to adults age </=60 with manageable toxicity.

Genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of the molecular taxonomy of ALL, and these advances have led the push to implement genome and transcriptome characterization in the clinical management of ALL to facilitate more accurate risk-stratification and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Although mutation- or pathway-directed targeted therapy (e.g., using tyrosine kinase inhibitors to treat Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positive and Phlike B-cell-ALL) is currently available for only a minority of children with ALL, many of the newly identified molecular alterations have led to the exploration of approaches targeting deregulated cell pathways. The efficacy of cellular or humoral immunotherapy has been demonstrated with the success of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and the bispecific engager blinatumomab in treating advanced disease.

Several criteria are felt to be necessary to consider discontinuation, while others may predict a better chance of achieving treatment-free remission. Criteria for discontinuation include patients in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia, a minimum duration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy of 3 years, sustained deep molecular response for at least 2 years and a molecular response of at least MR4. In addition, proper education of the patient on the need for more frequent monitoring, possible side effects related to stopping and having a reliable real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction laboratory are paramount to the safety and success of treatment-free remission. Realistically though, a maximum of only 20-30% of newly diagnosed patients will be able to achieve a successful treatment-free remission.

The initial response to therapy provides a sensitive measure of future clinical outcome. Measurement of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction standardized to the international reporting scale is now the principal recommended monitoring strategy. The method is used to assess early milestone responses and provides a guide for therapeutic intervention. When patients successfully traverse the critical first 12 months of TKI therapy, most will head towards another milestone response, deep molecular response (DMR, BCR-ABL1 </=0.01%). DMR is essential for patients aiming to achieve treatment-free remission and a prerequisite for a trial of TKI discontinuation. The success of discontinuation trials has led to new treatment strategies in order for more patients to reach this milestone response. DMR has been incorporated into endpoints of clinical trials and is considered by some expert groups as the optimal treatment response. But is DMR a stable response and does it provide the ultimate protection against TKI resistance and death? Do we need to increase the sensitivity of detection of BCR-ABL1 to better identify the patients who would likely remain in treatment-free remission after TKI discontinuation? Is it necessary to switch current TKI therapy to a more potent inhibitor if the goal is to achieve DMR?

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of recurrent molecular abnormalities in patients with CLL. Therefore, we assessed their incidences and associations with other clinical and genetic markers in the prospective multicenter COMPLEMENT1 trial (treatment naive patients not eligible for intensive treatment randomized to chlorambucil (CHL) vs. ofatumumab-CHL (O-CHL)). Baseline samples were available from 383 patients (85.6%) representative of the total trial cohort. Mutations were analyzed by amplicon-based targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS). In 52.2% of patients we found at least one mutation and the incidence was highest in NOTCH1 (17.0%), followed by SF3B1 (14.1%), ATM (11.7%), TP53 (10.2%), POT1 (7.0%), RPS15 (4.4%), FBXW7 (3.4%), MYD88 (2.6%) and BIRC3 (2.3%). While most mutations lacked prognostic significance, TP53 (HR2.02,p<0.01), SF3B1 (HR1.66,p=0.01) and NOTCH1 (HR1.39,p=0.03) were associated with inferior PFS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic role of TP53 for PFS (HR1.71,p=0.04) and OS (HR2.78,p=0.02) and of SF3B1 for PFS only (HR1.52,p=0.02). Notably, NOTCH1 mutation status separates patients with a strong and a weak benefit from ofatumumab addition to CHL (NOTCH1wt:HR0.50,p<0.01, NOTCH1mut:HR0.81,p=0.45). In summary, TP53 and SF3B1 were confirmed as independent prognostic and NOTCH1 as a predictive factor for reduced ofatumumab efficacy in a randomized chemo (immune)therapy CLL trial. These results validate NGS-based mutation analysis in a multicenter trial and provide a basis for expanding molecular testing in the prognostic workup of patients with CLL.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities has been shown to be an effective anti-tumor strategy as demonstrated for example by the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib, for treatment of various blood cancers. Here, we characterize a new multiple kinase inhibitor, ARQ531, and evaluate its mechanism of action in preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia. Treatment with ARQ531, by producing global signaling pathway deregulation, resulted in impaired cell cycle progression and survival in a large panel of leukemia cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells, regardless of the specific genetic background and/or the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that ARQ531 constrained tumor cell proliferation and survival through Bruton's tyrosine kinase and transcriptional program dysregulation, with proteasome-mediated MYB degradation and depletion of short-lived proteins that are crucial for tumor growth and survival, including ERK, MYC and MCL1. Finally, ARQ531 treatment was effective in a patient-derived leukemia mouse model with significant impairment of tumor progression and survival, at tolerated doses.

The zebrafish has emerged as a robust alternative xenograft model but, like mice, lack specific cytokines that mimic the microenvironment found in human patients. To address this critical gap, we generated the first humanized zebrafish that express human hematopoietic-specific cytokines (GM-CSF, SCF, and SDF1alpha). Termed GSS fish, these zebrafish promote survival, self-renewal and multilineage differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and result in enhanced proliferation and hematopoietic niche-specific homing of primary human leukemia cells.

However, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, clinical benefits of differentiation therapies are negligible in acute myeloid leukemia except for mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyses the fourth step of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. ASLAN003 is a highly potent dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor that induces differentiation, as well as reduces cell proliferation and viability, of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts including in chemo-resistant cells. Apoptotic pathways are triggered by ASLAN003, and it also significantly inhibits protein synthesis and activates AP-1 transcription, contributing to its differentiation promoting capacity. Finally, ASLAN003 substantially reduces leukemic burden and prolongs survival in acute myeloid leukemia xenograft mice and acute myeloid leukemia patient-derived xenograft models. Notably, the drug has no evident effect on normal hematopoietic cells and exhibits excellent safety profiles in mice, even after a prolonged period of administration.

Deregulation, including epigenetic deregulation, of the HOXA gene cluster drives transformation of about 50% of acute myeloid leukemia. We recently showed that the Histone 3 Lysine 9 methyltransferase SETDB1 negatively regulates the expression of the pro-leukemic genes Hoxa9 and its cofactor Meis1 through deposition of promoter H3K9 trimethylation in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells. Here, we investigated the biological impact of altered SETDB1 expression and changes in H3K9 methylation on acute myeloid leukemia. We demonstrate that SETDB1 expression is correlated to disease status and overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia patients. We recapitulated these findings in mice, where high expression of SETDB1 delayed MLL-AF9 mediated disease progression by promoting differentiation of leukemia cells. We also explored the biological impact of treating normal and malignant hematopoietic cells with an H3K9 methyltransferase inhibitor, UNC0638. While myeloid leukemia cells demonstrate cytotoxicity to UNC0638 treatment, normal bone marrow cells exhibit an expansion of cKit+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Consistent with these data, we show that bone marrow treated with UNC0638 is more amenable to transformation by MLL-AF9. Next generation sequencing of leukemia cells shows that high expression of SETDB1 induces repressive changes to the promoter epigenome and downregulation of genes linked with acute myeloid leukemia, including Dock1 and the MLL-AF9 target genes Hoxa9, Six1, and others. These data reveal novel targets of SETDB1 in leukemia that point to a role for SETDB1 in negatively regulating pro-leukemic target genes and suppressing acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Ropa, James', 'Saha, Nirmalya', 'Hu, Hsiangyu', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Muntean, Andrew G']","['Ropa J', 'Saha N', 'Hu H', 'Peterson LF', 'Talpaz M', 'Muntean AG']","['University of Michigan Medical School.', 'University of Michigan Medical School.', 'University of Michigan Medical School.', 'University of Michigan Medical School.', 'University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'University of Michigan Medical School.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL136420/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA140044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SIX1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lysine', 'Methylation', 'Mice', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism']",PMC7556517,,2020/10/16 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/10/15 09:52'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [aheadofprint]', '2020/10/15 09:52 [entrez]', '2020/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2019.223883 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2020 Sep 1;105(9):2273-2285. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.223883.,2273-2285,,20200901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although chemotherapy is the first-line treatment of AML, it exerts toxicity in noncancerous cells when used in high doses, thus necessitating the development of novel compounds with a high therapeutic window. This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of several compounds derived from the fruits of Melia azedarach (a tree with medicinal properties). Among them, 1-cinnamoyltrichilinin (CT) was found to strongly suppress the viability of HL-60 human leukemia cells. CT treatment induced apoptosis and increased nuclear fragmentation and fractional DNA content in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CT induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38), though not of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and activated Bcl-2 family proteins towards the proapoptosis and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Both CT-mediated apoptosis and apoptotic protein expression were reversed by treatment with the p38 inhibitor, thereby indicating the p38 pathway to be critical in CT-stimulated apoptosis. The results collectively indicated CT to suppress HL-60 survival by activating the p38 pathway and inducing apoptosis, hence being a novel potential therapeutic agent for AML.",,"['Jeong, Hoibin', 'Park, SeonJu', 'Kim, Seo-Young', 'Cho, Su-Hyeon', 'Jeong, Myeong Seon', 'Kim, Song-Rae', 'Seo, Jong Bok', 'Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Kim, Kil-Nam']","['Jeong H', 'Park S', 'Kim SY', 'Cho SH', 'Jeong MS', 'Kim SR', 'Seo JB', 'Kim SH', 'Kim KN']","['Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Seoul Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Seoul 02841, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Yonsei Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Yonsei University, Incheon 21983, Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Chuncheon 24341, Korea.']",['eng'],"['C030360/Korea Basic Science Institute', 'C08200/Korea Basic Science Institute']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Limonins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (trichilinin D)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Limonins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Melia azedarach/*chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC7589825,,2020/10/16 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/10/15 01:02'],"['2020/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/15 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21207506 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21207506 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Oct 12;21(20). pii: ijms21207506. doi: 10.3390/ijms21207506.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0784-5386', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2058-5045', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2613-0674']",20201012,['NOTNLM'],"['1-cinnamoyltrichilinin', 'Melia azedarach', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'limonoid', 'natural compound', 'p38 pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study objective was to evaluate comorbidities, the cardiovascular risk profile, and events throughout the chronic myeloid leukaemia disease course. METHODS: Retrospective data from adults who experienced haematology treatment at a single centre were continuously updated and followed throughout the disease course. A total of 43 subjects conforming with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study protocol were finally recruited. The median disease course was 77.0 +/- 17.5 months. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: More than three CV risk factors were identified in 41.9% of cases. Almost half of the cases had relevant comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) >/= 4), and no statistically significant comorbidities were found when comparing the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment subgroups (p = 0.53). The patients at high and very high CV risk, according to Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) risk classification, had 75.0% CV events (12/22 patients), p = 0.45. Throughout the disease course, 19 cardiovascular events were reported in 37.2% patients (13 males/3 females, p < 0.03). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring cardiovascular risk factors in Romanian chronic myeloid leukaemia patients. This study reinforces the need for close long-term follow-up that should be performed by a multidisciplinary team. The target should be not only the disease and specific drug-related toxicities but, also, the identification of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors before the commencement of and throughout TKI therapy.",,"['Varga, Andreea', 'Tilea, Ioan', 'Petra, Dorina Nastasia', 'Tilinca, Mariana-Cornelia', 'Gliga, Mirela Liana', 'Demian, Smaranda']","['Varga A', 'Tilea I', 'Petra DN', 'Tilinca MC', 'Gliga ML', 'Demian S']","['Department ME2, Faculty of Medicine in English, ""G.

Sechium edule, an edible species of chayote, has phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity and antineoplastic activity. A Sechium hybrid shows one thousand times greater antineoplastic activity than edible species, but its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and the content of phenolic compounds are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of the extract of fruits of the Sechium hybrid in vitro and in vivo. Phytochemical analysis using HPLC showed that the extract of the Sechium hybrid has at least 16 phenolic compounds; galangin, naringenin, phloretin and chlorogenic acid are the most abundant. In an in vitro assay, this extract inhibited 2,2-diphenyl-L-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity and protected the dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) phospholipid model cell membrane from oxidation mediated by hypochlorous acid (HClO). In vivo, it was identified that the most abundant metabolites in the extract enter the bloodstream of the treated mice.

Here, we demonstrated that DDA synergistically enhanced the toxicity of anthracyclines in AML cells but not in normal hematopoietic cells. Combination index of DDA treatment with either daunorubicin or idarubicin indicated a strong synergism in KG1a, KG1 and MV4-11 cell lines. This was confirmed in vivo using immunodeficient mice engrafted with MOLM-14 cells as well as in a panel of 20 genetically diverse AML patient samples. This effect was dependent on Liver X Receptor beta, a major target of DDA. Furthermore, DDA plus idarubicin strongly increased p53BP1 expression and the number of DNA strand breaks in alkaline comet assays as compared to idarubicin alone, whereas DDA alone was non-genotoxic. Mechanistically, DDA induced JNK phosphorylation and the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, thereby maximizing DNA damage induced by idarubicin and decreasing DNA repair. This activated autophagic cell death machinery in AML cells. Overall, this study shows that the combination of DDA and idarubicin is highly promising and supports clinical trials of dendrogenin A in AML patients.",,"['Mouchel, Pierre-Luc', 'Serhan, Nizar', 'Betous, Remy', 'Farge, Thomas', 'Saland, Estelle', 'De Medina, Philippe', 'Hoffmann, Jean-Sebastien', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Poirot, Marc', 'Silvente-Poirot, Sandrine', 'Recher, Christian']","['Mouchel PL', 'Serhan N', 'Betous R', 'Farge T', 'Saland E', 'De Medina P', 'Hoffmann JS', 'Sarry JE', 'Poirot M', 'Silvente-Poirot S', 'Recher C']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, 31059 Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Team ""Cholesterol Metabolism and Therapeutic Innovations"", Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR 1037, Inserm-Universite de Toulouse 3, Equipe labellisee par la ligue contre le cancer, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'CRCT, Universite de Toulouse, Inserm, CNRS, UPS, 31000 Toulouse, France.', ""Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer, 31037 Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Affichem SAS, 31400 Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence Toulouse Cancer (TOUCAN), Laboratoire de pathologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Toulouse, Oncopole, 31037 Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Team ""Cholesterol Metabolism and Therapeutic Innovations"", Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR 1037, Inserm-Universite de Toulouse 3, Equipe labellisee par la ligue contre le cancer, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Team ""Cholesterol Metabolism and Therapeutic Innovations"", Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR 1037, Inserm-Universite de Toulouse 3, Equipe labellisee par la ligue contre le cancer, 31037 Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, 31059 Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7601603,,2020/10/16 06:00,2020/10/16 06:01,['2020/10/15 01:01'],"['2020/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/15 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/16 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102933 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102933 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Oct 12;12(10). pii: cancers12102933. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102933.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7832-9146', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2222-354X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5711-6624', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3332-4525']",20201012,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CLDX', 'DDA', 'DNA damage', 'LXR', 'anthracycline', 'autophagy', 'dendrogenin A', 'primary sample', 'synergy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, polyclonal Tregs can be non-specifically immunosuppressive. Based on the advancements with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy in leukemia, we previously engineered Tregs to express a T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for a myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide. These TCR-engineered specific Tregs suppressed the proliferation of MBP-reactive T effector cells and ameliorated myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Herein, we extend this approach by creating human regulatory T cells expressing functional single-chain chimeric antigen receptors (scFv CAR), targeting either MBP or MOG. These scFv CAR-transduced Tregs retained FoxP3 and Helios, characteristic of Treg cells, after long-term expansion in vitro. Importantly, these engineered CNS targeting CAR-Tregs were able to suppress autoimmune pathology in EAE, demonstrating that these Tregs have the potential to be used as a cellular therapy for MS patients.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the impact of HLA heterozygosity, supertypes, and surface expression on outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent 8/8 HLA-matched, T cell replete, unrelated, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) from 2000 to 2015 using patient data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. HLA class I heterozygosity and HLA expression were not associated with overall survival, relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and acute graft-versus-host disease following HCT. The HLA-B62 supertype was associated with decreased TRM in the entire patient cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90; P = .00053). The HLA-B27 supertype was associated with worse DFS in patients with AML (HR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.32; P = .00005). These findings suggest that the survival benefit of HLA heterozygosity seen in solid tumor patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors does not extend to patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. Certain HLA supertypes, however, are associated with TRM and DFS, suggesting that similarities in peptide presentation between supertype members play a role in these outcomes. Beyond implications for prognosis following HCT, these findings support the further investigation of these HLA supertypes and the specific immune peptides important for transplant outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, VCR possesses dose-dependent neurotoxicity, which is the main factor restricting its application. Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) not only limits the dose of VCR and leads to the discontinuation of treatment but also triggers serious damage to the physical and mental health of patients. In addition, VIPN brings huge healthcare costs to patients and society. Individuals with VIPN often exhibit mechanical allodynia, sensory/tactile disorders, and numbness in the hands and feet. Unfortunately, VIPN is easily ignored due to its variable symptoms, which gives rise to insufficient research on the aetiology and pathogenesis of this disease, thereby resulting in a lack of appropriate preventive and therapeutic management. We performed a comprehensive review of the latest findings on VIPN in terms of symptoms, risk factors, potential mechanisms, and prevention and treatment measures.

These nuclei contain inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons, whose molecular diversity and development remain largely unraveled. Many tegmental neurons originate in the embryonic ventral rhombomere 1 (r1), where GABAergic fate is regulated by the transcription factor (TF) Tal1. We used single-cell mRNA sequencing of the mouse ventral r1 to characterize the Tal1-dependent and independent neuronal precursors. We describe gene expression dynamics during bifurcation of the GABAergic and glutamatergic lineages and show how active Notch signaling promotes GABAergic fate selection in post-mitotic precursors. We identify GABAergic precursor subtypes that give rise to distinct tegmental nuclei and demonstrate that Sox14 and Zfpm2, two TFs downstream of Tal1, are necessary for the differentiation of specific tegmental GABAergic neurons. Our results provide a framework for understanding the development of cellular diversity in the tegmental nuclei.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we examined the role of CD226 in the function of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and resistance to immunotherapy. In murine tumors, a large proportion of CD8(+) TILs had decreased surface expression of CD226 and exhibited features of dysfunction, whereas CD226(hi) TILs were highly functional. This correlation was seen also in TILs isolated from HNSCC patients. Mutation of CD226 at tyrosine 319 (Y319) led to increased CD226 surface expression, enhanced anti-tumor immunity and improved efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Mechanistically, tumor-derived CD155, the ligand for CD226, initiated phosphorylation of Y319 by Src kinases, thereby enabling ubiquitination of CD226 by CBL-B, internalization, and proteasomal degradation. In pre-treatment samples from melanoma patients, CD226(+)CD8(+) T cells correlated with improved progression-free survival following ICB.

Targeting alternative splicing by either increasing pro-apoptotic proteins or inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins in tumor cells may be an effective approach for gastric cancer (GC) therapy. However, the role of modulation of alternative splicing in GC remains poorly understood. In this study, to the best of our knowledge, the unbalanced expression of the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) splicing variants, Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S, was identified in GC patients for the first time. Increasing anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L and decreasing pro-apoptotic Mcl-1S expression levels were correlated with tumor proliferation and poor survival. In vitro data showed that a shift in splicing from Mcl-1L to Mcl-1S induced by treatment with Mcl-1-specific steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) efficiently decreased Mcl-1L expression, increased Mcl-1S expression, and accelerated tumor cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, mouse xenotransplant models confirmed that modification of Mcl-1 alternative splicing increased tumor cell death and suppressed tumor proliferation. This study demonstrated that the modification of Mcl-1 splicing might stimulate the pro-apoptotic factor and inhibit the anti-apoptotic protein to induce significant apoptosis.

This study aimed to determine safety and tolerability of iadademstat as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML). METHODS: This phase I, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation (DE), and extension-cohort (EC) trial included patients with R/R AML and evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antileukemic activity of this orally bioavailable first-in-class lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were treated with iadademstat on days 1 to 5 (5-220 microg/m(2)/d) of each week in 28-day cycles in a DE phase that resulted in a recommended dose of 140 microg/m(2)/d of iadademstat as a single agent. This dose was chosen to treat all patients (n = 14) in an EC enriched with patients with MLL/KMT2A-rearranged AML. Most adverse events (AEs) were as expected in R/R AML and included myelosuppression and nonhematologic AEs, such as infections, asthenia, mucositis, and diarrhea. PK data demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in plasma exposure, and PD data confirmed a potent time- and exposure-dependent induction of differentiation biomarkers. Reductions in blood and bone marrow blast percentages were observed, together with induction of blast cell differentiation, in particular, in patients with MLL translocations. One complete remission with incomplete count recovery was observed in the DE arm. CONCLUSION: Iadademstat exhibits a good safety profile together with signs of clinical and biologic activity as a single agent in patients with R/R AML. A phase II trial of iadademstat in combination with azacitidine is ongoing (EudraCT No.: 2018-000482-36).",,"['Salamero, Olga', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Willekens, Christophe', 'Perez-Simon, Jose Antonio', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Recher, Christian', 'Popat, Rakesh', 'Carpio, Cecilia', 'Molinero, Cesar', 'Mascaro, Cristina', 'Vila, Joaquim', 'Arevalo, M Isabel', 'Maes, Tamara', 'Buesa, Carlos', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Somervaille, Tim C P']","['Salamero O', 'Montesinos P', 'Willekens C', 'Perez-Simon JA', 'Pigneux A', 'Recher C', 'Popat R', 'Carpio C', 'Molinero C', 'Mascaro C', 'Vila J', 'Arevalo MI', 'Maes T', 'Buesa C', 'Bosch F', 'Somervaille TCP']","[""Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, UAB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hospital Universitari I Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif Cedex, France.', 'Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (Insitituto de Biomedicina De Sevilla/Consejo Superior De Investigaciones Cientificas/Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer), Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire CHU Bordeaux, Hopital du Haut Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'National Institute for Health Research UCLH Clinical Research Facility, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', ""Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, UAB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Oryzon Genomics, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Oryzon Genomics, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Oryzon Genomics, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Oryzon Genomics, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Oryzon Genomics, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Oryzon Genomics, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, UAB, Barcelona, Spain."", 'The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['C5759/A20971/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",PMC7768337,,2020/10/15 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/10/14 17:58'],"['2020/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/14 17:58 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.03250 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Dec 20;38(36):4260-4273. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.03250.

Preclinical evidence strongly supports the feasibility of this target and, although dozens of CK2 inhibitors have been described in the literature so far, CX-4945 (silmitasertib) was the first that entered into clinical trials for the treatment of both human haematological and solid tumours. However, kinase inhibitor monotherapies turned out to be effective only in a limited number of malignancies, probably due to the multifaceted causes that underlie them, supporting the emerging view that multi-targeted approaches to treat human tumours could be more effective. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we will address combined anti-cancer therapeutic strategies described so far which involve the use of CX-4945. Data from preclinical studies clearly show the ability of CX-4945 to synergistically cooperate with different classes of anti-neoplastic agents, thereby contributing to an orchestrated anti-tumour action against multiple targets. Overall, these promising outcomes support the translation of CX-4945 combined therapies into clinical anti-cancer applications.",,"[""D'Amore, Claudio"", 'Borgo, Christian', 'Sarno, Stefania', 'Salvi, Mauro']","[""D'Amore C"", 'Borgo C', 'Sarno S', 'Salvi M']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. claudio.damore@unipd.it.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. mauro.salvi@unipd.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Phenazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'C6RWP0N0L2 (silmitasertib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Casein Kinase II/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Naphthyridines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Phenazines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC7717057,,2020/10/15 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2020/10/14 12:46'],"['2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/14 12:46 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13402-020-00566-w [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-020-00566-w [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2020 Dec;43(6):1003-1016. doi: 10.1007/s13402-020-00566-w.

Cytostatics, abdominal radiotherapy, total body irradiation (TBI) and some agents used in supportive care may induce acute kidney injury (AKI) or lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are increased in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. METHOD: The study cohort consisted of 86 patients (42 females) previously treated for ALL. The median time after cessation of treatment was 6.55 (IQR: 1.96-9.93) years and median age at the time of study: 12 (IQR: 6.76-16.00). The control group included 53 healthy peers. Immunoenzymatic ELISA commercial kits were used to measure urine KIM-1 and NGAL levels. RESULTS: The median levels of urine uNGAL (p < 0.05), uNGAL/creatinine (cr.) ratio (p < 0.0001) and uKIM-1/creatinine ratio (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in ALL survivors in comparison with healthy controls. Female patients had significantly higher levels of NGAL and NGAL/cr. than males (mean 8.42 +/- 7.1 vs. 4.59 +/- 4.5 ng/mL and 86.57 +/- 77 vs. 37.7 +/- 37 ng/mg, respectively; p < 0.01). Of all the study participants, 11 (13%) presented eGFR below 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The NGAL/cr. ratio seemed to be the best predictor of decreased eGFR (AUC = 0.65). The cumulative dose of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide did not predict the values of the urine NGAL, NGAL/cr., KIM-1/cr. and eGFR. Five years after the end of treatment, the patients had higher levels of uKIM-1 (1.02 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.6 ng/mL, p < 0.01), uNGAL (7.9 +/- 6.7 vs. 4.6 +/- 5 ng/mL, p < 0.01) and lower eGFR (114 +/- 29 vs. 134 +/- 35 mL/min/1.73 m(2), p < 0.01) in comparison with ALL survivors with the observation period of less than 5 years. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that ALL survivors have higher levels of urine NGAL, NGAL/cr. and uKIM-1/cr. ratio as compared to the control group. Further long-term follow-up studies are necessary to assess the significance of the NGAL and KIM-1 and their relationship to kidney damage after anticancer treatment in childhood.",,"['Latoch, Eryk', 'Kononczuk, Katarzyna', 'Taranta-Janusz, Katarzyna', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Szymczak, Edyta', 'Wasilewska, Anna', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna']","['Latoch E', 'Kononczuk K', 'Taranta-Janusz K', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Szymczak E', 'Wasilewska A', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, ul.

How caregiving affects the larger family system is less understood, yet knowing this is vital to developing supportive resources for caregivers, patients, and their families. To better understand how blood cancer caregiving impacts the family system, we explored the experiences of adult child caregivers of diagnosed parents and parent caregivers of diagnosed children. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 39 midlife parent and adult child caregivers of patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Using a family systems theory lens, we conducted a thematic analysis using the constant comparative method to identify how caregiving impacts the larger family system. RESULTS: Caregivers ranged from age 30 to 64 (M = 43). They described four ways that caregiving impacted themselves and the larger family system: (1) disruption of home life, (2) emotional (dis)connection, (3) juggling competing roles, and (4) developing resiliency and intimacy. Perspectives within each category differed based on their relational role to the patient or in the broader family. CONCLUSIONS: Themes identify ways to provide support to both caregiver types. Support care resources could help families navigate gains and losses impacting the family system after a blood cancer diagnosis. Both caregiver types described experiencing (and/or their family experiencing) a loss in relational connection, feeling alone, and members distancing themselves. Both caregiver types also described gains in family functioning, like strengthened bonds and togetherness. Findings validate the need for family-centered support with key areas to address for healthy family functioning.",,"['Fisher, Carla L', 'Mullis, Michaela D', 'Kastrinos, Amanda', 'Wollney, Easton', 'Weiss, Elisa S', 'Sae-Hau, Maria', 'Bylund, Carma L']","['Fisher CL', 'Mullis MD', 'Kastrinos A', 'Wollney E', 'Weiss ES', 'Sae-Hau M', 'Bylund CL']","['College of Journalism & Communications, UF Health Cancer Center, UF Health Center for Arts in Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. carlalfisher@ufl.edu.', 'College of Journalism & Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'College of Journalism & Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'College of Journalism & Communications, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.', 'College of Journalism & Communications, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2020/10/15 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/10/14 09:18'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/14 09:18 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05811-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05811-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Jun;29(6):3069-3076. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05811-4.

METHODS: A multicenter single-arm feasibility study that included patients newly diagnosed with acute leukemia (n = 36) and patient ambassadors previously treated for acute leukemia (n = 25). Prior to the intervention, all patient ambassadors attended a 6-h group training program. In the intervention, patient ambassadors provided 12 weeks of support for patients within 2 weeks of being diagnosed. Outcome measures included feasibility (primary outcome), safety, anxiety, and depression measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, and symptom burden by MD Anderson Symptom Inventory, the Patient Activation Measure, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. RESULTS: Patient ambassador support was feasible and safe in this population. Patients and patient ambassadors reported high satisfaction with the individually adjusted support, and patients improved in psychosocial outcomes over time. Patient ambassadors maintained their psychosocial baseline level, with no adverse events, and used the available support to exchange experiences with other patient ambassadors and to manage challenges. CONCLUSION: The patient ambassador support program is feasible and has the potential to be a new model of care incorporated in the hematology clinical care setting, creating an active partnership between patients and former patients. This may strengthen the existing supportive care services for patients with acute leukemia.

METHODS: The clinical data of 1 055 AL patients with BSI admitted to the hematology ward of three large-scale hospitals in Hunan Province from January 2010 to December 2018 were collected. The etiology, antibiotic susceptibility data and clinical features of patients with G(-) bacterial infection were analyzed. RESULTS: G(-) bacterial infection accounted for 622 AL patients with BSI, and the main pathogens were Escherichia coli (277 strains, 44.53%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (138 strains, 22.19%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains, 13.02%). Most G(-) bacteria were highly sensitive to carbapenems and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor. State of disease, Pitt score >/=4, treatment with vasoactive agents and sensitive antibiotic >48 h were independent risk factors of 30-day mortality.

Several inhibitors targeting the expression of XBP-1s have been reported; however, the cytotoxicity exerted by each inhibitor against cancer cells is highly variable. To design better therapeutic strategies for B-cell cancer, we systematically compared the ability of these compounds to inhibit the RNase activity of IRE-1 in vitro and to suppress the expression of XBP-1s in mouse and human MM cell lines. Tricyclic chromenone-based inhibitors B-I09 and D-F07, prodrugs harboring an aldehyde-masking group, emerged as the most reliable inhibitors for potent suppression of XBP-1s expression in MM cells. The cytotoxicity of B-I09 and D-F07 against MM as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma could be further enhanced by combination with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Here, we investigated whether the consensus VH CDR3 sequences from CLL stereotyped subsets can be exploited for immunotherapy approaches. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunogenic epitopes from the consensus VH CDR3 sequence of the clinically aggressive subsets #1 and #2 and from Emu-TCL1 mice, which spontaneously develop CLL with BcR IG stereotypy, were identified and used to generate specific HLA class I- and II-restricted T cells in vitro. T-cell reactivity was assayed in vitro as IFNgamma production. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells loaded with the peptides were used as vaccination strategy to restrain leukemia development in the Emu-TCL1 mouse model. RESULTS: These stereotyped epitopes were naturally processed and presented by CLL cells to the VH CDR3-specific T cells. Furthermore, we validated the efficacy of VH CDR3 peptide-based immunotherapy in the Emu-TCL1 transplantable mouse model. Immunization of mice against defined VH CDR3 peptide epitopes, prior to the challenge with the corresponding leukemia cells, resulted in the control of CLL development in a significant fraction of mice, and increased overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the immunogenicity of stereotyped VH CDR3 sequences and support the feasibility and efficacy of their use for novel cancer vaccine in CLL. Such approach has the advantage to generate ""off-the-shelf"" therapeutic vaccines for relevant groups of patients belonging to stereotyped subsets.See related commentary by Seiffert, p. 659.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Rovida, Alessandra', 'Maccalli, Cristina', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Dellabona, Paolo', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Rovida A', 'Maccalli C', 'Scarfo L', 'Dellabona P', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ghia P']","['Unit of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Immuno-biotherapy of melanoma and solid tumors, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Experimental Immunology, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious diseases, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

To identify new AR regulators, we focused on Mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5), a histone-regulating enzyme, because significantly higher MLL5 expression was detected in prostate cancer tissues than in matching normal tissues. When we expressed shRNAs targeting MLL5 gene in prostate cancer cell line, the growth rate and AR activity were reduced compared to those in control cells, and migration ability of the knockdown cells was reduced significantly. To determine the molecular mechanisms of MLL5 on AR activity, we proved that AR physically interacted with MLL5 and other co-factors, including SET-1 and HCF-1, using an immunoprecipitation method. The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed reduced binding of MLL5, co-factors, and AR enzymes to AR target gene promoters in MLL5 shRNA-expressing cells. Histone H3K4 methylation on the AR target gene promoters was reduced, and H3K9 methylation at the same site was increased in MLL5 knockdown cells. Finally, xenograft tumor formation revealed that reduction of MLL5 in prostate cancer cells retarded tumor growth. Our results thus demonstrate the important role of MLL5 as a new epigenetic regulator of AR in prostate cancer.

It is a form of cancer that is difficult to treat and much research is being done to identify new molecular entities and to tackle drug resistance issues. In recent years, drug resistance of Abl1 tyrosine kinase has become a major healthcare concern. Second and third-generation TKI reported better responses against the resistant forms; still they had no impact on long-term survival prolongation. New compounds derived from natural products and organic small molecule inhibitors can lay the foundation for better clinical therapies in the future. Computational methods, experimental and biological studies can help us understand the mechanism of drug resistance and identify novel molecule inhibitors. ADMET parameters analysis of reported drugs and novel small molecule inhibitors can also provide valuable insights. In this review, available therapies, point mutations, structure-activity relationship and ADMET parameters of reported series of Abl1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and drugs are summarised. We summarise in detail recent computational and molecular biology studies that focus on designing drug molecules, investigation of natural product compounds and organic new chemical entities. Current ongoing research suggests that selective targeting of Abl1 tyrosine kinase at the molecular level to combat drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia is promising.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Sobhia, Masilamani Elizabeth', 'Kumar, G Siva', 'Mallick, Antara', 'Singh, Harmanpreet', 'Kumar, Kranthi', 'Chaurasiya, Meenakshi', 'Singh, Monica', 'Gera, Narendra', 'Deverakonda, Sindhuja', 'Baghel, Vinay']","['Sobhia ME', 'Kumar GS', 'Mallick A', 'Singh H', 'Kumar K', 'Chaurasiya M', 'Singh M', 'Gera N', 'Deverakonda S', 'Baghel V']","['Department of Pharmacoinformatics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, S.A.S.

Several reports have described the generation of canine somatic cell-derived iPSCs; however, none have described the canine somatic cell reprogramming using a non-integrating and self-replicating RNA transfection method. The purpose of this study was to investigate the optimal strategy using this approach and characterize the transition stage of ciPSCs. In this study, fibroblasts obtained from a 13-year-old dog were reprogrammed using a non-integrating Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) RNA virus replicon, which has four reprogramming factors (collectively referred to as T7-VEE-OKS-iG and comprised of hOct4, hKlf4, hSox2, and hGlis1) and co-transfected with the T7-VEE-OKS-iG RNA and B18R mRNA for 4 h. One day after the final transfection, the cells were selected with puromycin (0.5 microg/mL) until day 10. After about 25 days, putative ciPSC colonies were identified showing TRA-1-60 expression and alkaline phosphatase activity. To determine the optimal culture conditions, the basic fibroblast growth factor in the culture medium was replaced with a modified medium supplemented with murine leukemia inhibitory factor (mLIF) and two kinase inhibitors (2i), PD0325901(MEK1/2 inhibitor) and CHIR99021 (GSK3beta inhibitor). The derived colonies showed resemblance to naive iPSCs in their morphology (dome-shaped) and are dependent on mLIF and 2i condition to maintain an undifferentiated phenotype. The expression of endogenous pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Nanog, and Rex1 transcripts were confirmed, suggesting that induced ciPSCs were in the late intermediate stage of reprogramming. In conclusion, the non-integrating and self-replicating VEE RNA replicon system can potentially make a great contribution to the generation of clinically applicable ciPSCs, and the findings of this study suggest a new method to utilize the VEE RNA approach for canine somatic cell reprogramming.",,"['Kim, Mirae', 'Hwang, Seon-Ung', 'Yoon, Junchul David', 'Jeong, Yeon Woo', 'Kim, Eunhye', 'Hyun, Sang-Hwan']","['Kim M', 'Hwang SU', 'Yoon JD', 'Jeong YW', 'Kim E', 'Hyun SH']","['Veterinary Medical Center and College of Veterinary Medicine, Laboratory of Veterinary Embryology and Biotechnology (VETEMBIO), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Institute of Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Veterinary Medical Center and College of Veterinary Medicine, Laboratory of Veterinary Embryology and Biotechnology (VETEMBIO), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Institute of Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Veterinary Medical Center and College of Veterinary Medicine, Laboratory of Veterinary Embryology and Biotechnology (VETEMBIO), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Institute of Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Abu Dhabi Biotech Research Foundation, 64 Kyungin-ro, Guro-gu, Seoul, Korea.', 'Veterinary Medical Center and College of Veterinary Medicine, Laboratory of Veterinary Embryology and Biotechnology (VETEMBIO), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Veterinary Medical Center and College of Veterinary Medicine, Laboratory of Veterinary Embryology and Biotechnology (VETEMBIO), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.', 'Institute of Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM), Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.']",['eng'],"['2020R1A2C2008276/National Research Foundation of Korea', '318016-5/Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food,', 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries', '819029-2/Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food,', 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries', '320005-4/Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food,', 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries', '2017K1A4A3014959/National Research Foundation of Korea', '2017020681010101/Korea Small and Medium Business Administration']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Animals (Basel),Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,101635614,,,,PMC7601034,,2020/10/15 06:00,2020/10/15 06:01,['2020/10/14 01:04'],"['2020/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/14 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/15 06:01 [medline]']","['ani10101848 [pii]', '10.3390/ani10101848 [doi]']",epublish,Animals (Basel). 2020 Oct 11;10(10). pii: ani10101848. doi: 10.3390/ani10101848.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5276-4374', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7293-9322']",20201011,['NOTNLM'],"['VEE RNA', 'canine', 'iPSCs', 'integration-free', 'reprogramming']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients commonly present acutely with fever, constitutional symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, and often disseminated intravascular coagulation or hemophagocytic syndrome. This acute clinical presentation and the variable pathologic and immunophenotypic features of ANKL overlap with other diagnostic entities, making it challenging to establish a timely and accurate diagnosis of ANKL. Since its original recognition in 1986, substantial progress in understanding this disease using traditional pathologic approaches has improved diagnostic accuracy. This progress, in turn, has facilitated the performance of recent high-throughput studies that have yielded insights into pathogenesis. Molecular abnormalities that occur in ANKL can be divided into three major groups: JAK/STAT pathway activation, epigenetic dysregulation, and impairment of TP53 and DNA repair. These high-throughput data also have provided potential therapeutic targets that promise to improve therapy and outcomes for patients with ANKL. In this review, we provide a historical context of the conception and evolution of ANKL as a disease entity, we highlight advances in diagnostic criteria to recognize this disease, and we review recent understanding of pathogenesis as well as biomarker discoveries that are providing groundwork for innovative therapies.",,"['El Hussein, Siba', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['El Hussein S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Khoury JD']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7600035,,2020/10/15 06:00,2020/10/15 06:01,['2020/10/14 01:04'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/14 01:04 [entrez]', '2020/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/15 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102900 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102900 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Oct 9;12(10). pii: cancers12102900. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102900.,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2621-3584'],20201009,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cell', '*biomarker', '*immunohistochemistry', '*leukemia', '*molecular']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical presentation depends on a host's immunity and can be localized or disseminated. Since there are few reports of disseminated fusariosis in children, we described an unusual case of Fusarium solani infection in a 9-year-old child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This patient presented a deep wound in the elbow at diagnosis. During the induction phase of chemotherapy, he developed multiple skin lesions and severe pneumonia; Fusarium solani was cultured from the skin lesions. He was treated with a high dose of liposomal amphotericin B, followed by voriconazole. Starting from this peculiar case, we collected all patients with acute leukemia affected by Fusarium infection, treated in the pediatric Onco-Hematology Division of Padua University Hospital during the last 20 years. We identified another six cases: all these patients were affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and five of them presented a relapsed/refractory disease. Two out of seven patients died because of infection; five patients recovered from infection, but three out of seven died because of leukemia. Skin lesions in immunocompromised patients should rise the suspicion of disseminated fusariosis. Furthermore, considering the emergence of filamentous fungi in immunocompromised patients, we all should be aware of Fusarium infection, reminding us that the diagnosis is important to cure the infection.",,"['Biddeci, Giada', 'Dona, Daniele', 'Geranio, Giulia', 'Spadini, Silvia', 'Petris, Maria Grazia', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Biffi, Alessandra', 'Putti, Maria Caterina']","['Biddeci G', 'Dona D', 'Geranio G', 'Spadini S', 'Petris MG', 'Pillon M', 'Biffi A', 'Putti MC']","['Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Infectious Disease Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Maternal and Child Health Department, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Division, Padua University Hospital, 35128 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Switzerland,J Fungi (Basel),"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",101671827,,,,PMC7712314,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2020/10/15 06:00,2020/10/15 06:01,['2020/10/14 01:03'],"['2020/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/14 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/15 06:01 [medline]']","['jof6040212 [pii]', '10.3390/jof6040212 [doi]']",epublish,J Fungi (Basel). 2020 Oct 9;6(4). pii: jof6040212. doi: 10.3390/jof6040212.,,,20201009,['NOTNLM'],"['Fusarium infection', 'leukemia', 'mycosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, ruxolitinib continues to be studied in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). The benefits of JAK inhibition in terms of splenomegaly and symptoms in patients with MF are undeniable, and ruxolitinib prolongs the survival of persons with higher risk MF. Despite this, however, ""disease-modifying"" effects of JAK inhibitors in MF, i.e., bone marrow fibrosis and mutant allele burden reduction, are limited. Similarly, in HU-resistant/intolerant PV, while ruxolitinib provides excellent control of the hematocrit, symptoms and splenomegaly, reduction in the rate of thromboembolic events has not been convincingly demonstrated. Furthermore, JAK inhibitors do not prevent disease evolution to MF or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Frontline cytoreductive therapy for PV generally comprises HU and interferons, which have their own limitations. Numerous novel agents, representing diverse mechanisms of action, are in development for the treatment of these three classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). JAK inhibitor-based combinations, all of which are currently under study for MF, have been covered elsewhere in this issue.

Mechanistically, magnolol increased ATF4-dependent DR5 expression at the transcription level, and knockdown of ATF4 markedly inhibited magnolol-induced DR5 upregulation. Silencing DR5 with siRNA prevented combined treatment with magnolol and TRAIL-induced apoptosis and PARP cleavage. Magnolol induced proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 downregulation, while magnolol-induced c-FLIP downregulation was regulated, at least in part, by lysosomal degradation.

We conducted this study to examine the prognostic impact of UC/inconclusive cytogenetic analysis on outcomes in patients with AML undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo HSCT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all adults undergoing Allo HSCT for AML from January 2011 to August 2019. Patients with any documented cytogenetic abnormalities were excluded. Baseline characteristics and transplant outcomes were compared between patients with normal cytogenetics and those with UC. RESULTS: Overall, 243 AML patients (median age, 55 years; 55.1% female) were included. UC were reported in 79 patients, whereas 164 patients had a normal karyotype. The two groups were similar to each other in terms of baseline demographics, treatment received, and transplant related variables. There was no difference between patients with UC and normal cytogenetics in terms of relapse-free survival (66 months vs. 42 months, p = .53) or overall survival (OS; 77 months vs. 76 months, p = .72). Survival parameters remained similar even in subgroup analysis based on NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status. Significant predictors of OS after Allo HSCT in AML patients with UC were increased age at time of Allo HSCT (hazard ratio [HR] = -1.049; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.005-1.095), favorable (NPM1(Mut)/FLT3(wt)) mutation profile (HR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.84), neutrophil engraftment < 17 days, and absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (HR = 3.27; 95% CI, 1.20-8.60). CONCLUSION: Outcomes after Allo HSCT are comparable between AML patients with UC analysis and patients with normal cytogenetics even after stratification based on molecular risk factors. Allogeneic Allo HSCT may mitigate the poor prognosis of UC analysis in patients with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre. Published', 'by Elsevier Ltd.

Rd continuous similarly extended PFS vs fixed-duration Rd for 18 cycles (Rd18). Outcomes in the Canadian/US subgroup (104 patients per arm) are reported in this analysis. Rd continuous demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS vs MPT (median, 29.3 vs 20.2 months; HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.49-0.97]; p = 0.03326) and an improvement vs Rd18 (median, 21.9 months). Median OS was 56.9 vs 46.8 months with Rd continuous vs MPT (p = 0.15346) and 59.5 months with Rd18. The overall response rate was higher with Rd continuous and Rd18 (78.8% and 79.8%) vs MPT (65.4%).

Donor T cells not only facilitate engraftment and protect against opportunistic pathogens and residual disease, but can also cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with significant morbidity and mortality. Complete T-cell depletion can not only substantially reduce GVHD rates but can also delay immune reconstitution and increase rates of opportunistic infections and relapse. Murine models have shown that naive T cells (TNs) consistently cause severe GVHD, whereas memory T cells cause milder or no GVHD and have critical graft-versus-tumor function. Informed by experiments performed in murine models of HCT, clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate TN-depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. These trials are showing very low rates of chronic GVHD and of serious acute GVHD in the HLA-matched HCT setting, with lower frequencies of opportunistic infections than after fully T-cell-depleted HCT and no apparent increase in relapse rates. Randomized clinical trials are ongoing, comparing standard unselected HCT with TN-depleted PBSCs and other promising GVHD-reduction strategies. Correlative laboratory studies will clarify how antitumor function is retained in TN-depleted HCT and inform strategies to further augment graft-versus-leukemia in patients at a high risk of relapse. TN depletion of donor lymphocyte infusions and of haploidentical stem cell grafts is also being investigated.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bleakley, Marie']",['Bleakley M'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Animals', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC7556126,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/13 17:13'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31231-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001888 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Oct 13;4(19):4980. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001888.,4980,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03779854'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this post hoc subgroup analysis from the trial, we evaluated the impact of midostaurin in 163 patients with FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. At a median follow-up of 60.7 months (95% CI, 55.0-70.8), the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was significantly higher in patients treated with midostaurin than in those treated with placebo (45.2% vs 30.1%; P = .044). A trend toward improved disease-free survival was also observed with midostaurin (67.3% vs 53.4%; P = .089), whereas overall survival (OS) was similar in the 2 groups. Patients with AML and NPM1mut/FLT3-TKDmut or core binding factor (CBF)-rearranged/FLT3-TKDmut genotypes had significantly prolonged OS with or without censoring at hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), compared with NPM1WT/CBF-negative AMLs.

Several HLA-A allotypes also exhibit the Bw4 epitope. Studies with natural killer (NK) cell clones have demonstrated NK inhibition via KIR3DL1 by HLA-A Bw4+ allotypes, but did not delineate strengths of inhibition or hierarchies of NK education. Using primary NK cells from healthy donors, we demonstrate that HLA-A*23, HLA-A*24, and HLA-A*32 proteins are expressed at different densities and exhibit different capacities to educate and inhibit KIR3DL1-expressing NK cells in vitro. Among the HLA-A Bw4+ allotypes, HLA-A*24 and HLA-A*32 demonstrate the strongest inhibitory capacity. To determine if HLA-A allotypes with strong inhibitory capacity have similar negative impact in allogeneic HCT as HLA-B Bw4+ allotypes, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1729 patients with AML who received an allogeneic HCT from a 9/10 or 10/10 HLA allele-matched unrelated donor. Examination of the donor-recipient pairs whose Bw4 epitope was exclusively contributed from HLA-A*24 and A*32 allotypes revealed that patients with HLA-A*24 who received an allograft from a KIR3DL1+ donor experienced a higher risk of disease relapse (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.32; P = .004) when compared with patients without a Bw4 epitope. These findings indicate that despite weak affinity interactions with KIR3DL1, common HLA-A allotypes with the Bw4 epitope can interact with KIR3DL1+ donor NK cells with clinically meaningful impact and provide additional insight to donor NK alloreactivity in HLA-matched HCT.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['van der Ploeg, Kattria', 'Le Luduec, Jean-Benoit', 'Stevenson, Philip A', 'Park, Soo', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Petersdorf, Effie W', 'Shaffer, Brian C', 'Hsu, Katharine C']","['van der Ploeg K', 'Le Luduec JB', 'Stevenson PA', 'Park S', 'Gooley TA', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Shaffer BC', 'Hsu KC']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI125651/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI069197/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 HL140134/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (HLA-A Antigens)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7556125,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/13 17:13'],"['2020/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31229-5 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002086 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Oct 13;4(19):4955-4964. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002086.,4955-4964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression of NKL homeobox gene subclass members have been reported in several hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we analyzed the oncogenic role of the HMX-group of NKL homeobox genes in AML. Public expression profiling data-available for HMX1 and HMX2-indicate aberrant activity of HMX2 in circa 2% AML patients overall, rising to 31% in those with KMT2A/MLL rearrangements whereas HMX1 expression remains inconspicuous. AML cell lines EOL-1, MV4-11 and MOLM-13 expressed both, HMX2 and neighboring HMX3 genes, and harbored KMT2A aberrations, suggesting their potential functional association. Surprisingly, knockdown experiments in these cell lines demonstrated that KMT2A inhibited HMX2/3 which, in turn, did not regulate KMT2A expression. Furthermore, karyotyping and genomic profiling analysis excluded rearrangements of the HMX2/3 locus in these cell lines. However, comparative expression profiling and subsequent functional analyses revealed that IRF8, IL7- and WNT-signalling activated HMX2/3 expression while TNFa/NFkB- signalling proved inhibitory. Whole genome sequencing of EOL-1 identified two mutations in the regulatory upstream regions of HMX2/3 resulting in generation of a consensus ETS-site and transformation of a former NFkB-site into an SP1-site. Reporter-gene assays demonstrated that both mutations contributed to HMX2/3 activation, modifying ETS1/ELK1- and TNFalpha-mediated gene regulation. Moreover, DMSO-induced eosinophilic differentiation of EOL-1 cells coincided with HMX2/3 downregulation while knockdown of HMX2 induced cell differentiation, collectively supporting a fundamental role for these genes in myeloid differentiation arrest. Finally, target genes of HMX2/3 were identified in EOL-1 and included suppression of differentiation gene EPX, and activation of fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRA and receptor-encoding gene HTR7, both of which enhanced oncogenic ERK-signalling. Taken together, our study documents a leukemic role for deregulated NKL homeobox genes HMX2 and HMX3 in AML, revealing molecular mechanisms of myeloid differentiation arrest.",,"['Nagel, Stefan', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Nagel S', 'Pommerenke C', 'Meyer C', 'MacLeod RAF', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HMX3 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcriptome']",PMC7553312,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2020/10/14 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/13 17:12'],"['2020/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 17:12 [entrez]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0240120 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-18850 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Oct 13;15(10):e0240120. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0240120. eCollection 2020.,e0240120,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4431-8988'],20201013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first formulate two general problems to unify various special cases studied in the literature: 1) the horizon length is a priori fixed and 2) the horizon length is unspecified but finite for given destination states. Notably, both problems can incorporate time-variant costs, which are rarely considered in existing work, and a variety of constraints. The existence of an optimal control sequence is analyzed under mild assumptions. Motivated by BCNs' finite state space and control space, we approach the two general problems intuitively and efficiently under a graph-theoretical framework. A weighted state transition graph and its time-expanded variants are developed, and the equivalence between the FHOC problem and the shortest-path (SP) problem in specific graphs is established rigorously. Two algorithms are developed to find the SP and construct the optimal control sequence for the two problems with reduced computational complexity, though technically, a classical SP algorithm in graph theory is sufficient for all problems. Compared with existing algebraic methods, our graph-theoretical approach can achieve state-of-the-art time efficiency while targeting the most general problems. Furthermore, our approach is the first one capable of solving Problem 2) with time-variant costs. Finally, a genetic network in the bacterium E. coli and a signaling network involved in human leukemia are used to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The results of two common tasks for both networks show that our approach can dramatically reduce the running time.

Expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in B-ALL is well-described and it has been recognized that a diagnosis of mixed phenotype acute leukemia should be made cautiously if MPO expression is the sole myeloid feature in these cases. We sought to determine whether MPO expression in pediatric B-ALL was associated with differences in laboratory, immunophenotypic, or clinical features. METHODS: We reviewed clinical, diagnostic bone marrow flow cytometry, and laboratory data for all new B-ALL diagnoses at our pediatric institution in 5 years. Cases were categorized as MPO positive (MPO+) or negative (MPO-) using a threshold of >/=20% blasts expressing MPO at intensity greater than the upper limit of normal lymphocytes on diagnostic bone marrow flow cytometry. RESULTS: A total of 148 cases were reviewed, 32 of which (22%) were MPO+. MPO+ B-ALL was more frequently hyperdiploid and less frequently harbored ETV6-RUNX1; no MPO+ cases had KMT2A rearrangements or BCR-ABL1. Although not significantly so, MPO+ B-ALL was less likely than MPO- B-ALL to have positive end-of-induction minimal residual disease studies (9.4 and 24%, respectively), but relapse rates and stem cell transplantation rates were similar between groups. Aberrant expression of other more typically myeloid markers was similar between these groups. CONCLUSION: In our study cohort, MPO+ B-ALL showed minimal residual disease persistence less often after induction chemotherapy but otherwise had similar clinical outcomes to MPO- B-ALL, with similar rates of additional myeloid antigen aberrancy.",['(c) 2020 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['McGinnis, Eric', 'Yang, David', 'Au, Nicholas', 'Morrison, Douglas', 'Chipperfield, Kate M', 'Setiadi, Audi F', 'Liu, Lorraine', 'Tsang, Angela', 'Vercauteren, Suzanne M']","['McGinnis E', 'Yang D', 'Au N', 'Morrison D', 'Chipperfield KM', 'Setiadi AF', 'Liu L', 'Tsang A', 'Vercauteren SM']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', ""Division of Hematopathology, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

This study was aimed at characterizing genetic variation related to adult body mass index (BMI) among survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: Genetic associations of BMI among 1458 adult survivors of childhood ALL (median time from diagnosis, 20 years) were analyzed by multiple approaches. A 2-stage genome-wide association study in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE) was performed. BMI was a highly polygenic trait in the general population. Within the known loci, the BMI percent variance explained was estimated, and additive interactions (chi-square test) with CRT in the CCSS were evaluated. The role of DNA methylation in CRT interaction was further evaluated in a subsample of ALL survivors. RESULTS: In a meta-analysis of the CCSS and SJLIFE, 2 novel loci associated with adult BMI among survivors of childhood ALL (LINC00856 rs575792008 and EMR1 rs62123082; PMeta < 5E-8) were identified. It was estimated that the more than 700 known loci explained 6.2% of the variation in adult BMI in childhood ALL survivors. Within the known loci, significant main effects for 23 loci and statistical interactions with CRT at 9 loci (P < 7.0E-5) were further identified. At 2 CRT-interacting loci, DNA methylation patterns may have differed by age. CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood ALL have genetic heritability for BMI similar to that observed in the general population. This study provides evidence that treatment with CRT can modify the effect of genetic variants on adult BMI in childhood ALL survivors.",['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],"['Richard, Melissa A', 'Brown, Austin L', 'Belmont, John W', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Arroyo, Vidal M', 'Foster, Kayla L', 'Kern, Kathleen D', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Sapkota, Yadav', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Morton, Lindsay M', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Kamdar, Kala Y']","['Richard MA', 'Brown AL', 'Belmont JW', 'Scheurer ME', 'Arroyo VM', 'Foster KL', 'Kern KD', 'Hudson MM', 'Leisenring WM', 'Okcu MF', 'Sapkota Y', 'Yasui Y', 'Morton LM', 'Chanock SJ', 'Robison LL', 'Armstrong GT', 'Bhatia S', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Lupo PJ', 'Kamdar KY']","[""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Clinical Research and Public Health Sciences Divisions, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", ""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adiposity/genetics', 'Adult', '*Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events', '*Body Mass Index', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*epidemiology/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC7790879,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/10/13 12:14'],"['2020/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/13 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33258 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Jan 15;127(2):310-318. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33258.

Distinct metabolic pathways lead to the generation of Cer species with distinguishable roles in oncogenesis. Deregulation of Cer pathways has emerged as an important mechanism for acquired chemotherapeutic resistance. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells are defective in Cer synthesis. ATL is an aggressive neoplasm that develops following infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) where the viral oncogene Tax contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. ATL cells, resistant to all-trans-retinoic acid, are sensitive to pharmacologically achievable concentrations of the synthetic retinoid ST1926. We studied the effects of ST1926 on Cer pathways in ATL cells. ST1926 treatment resulted in early Tax oncoprotein degradation in HTLV-1-treated cells. ST1926 induced cell death and a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of Cer in malignant T cells. The kinetics and degree of Cer production showed an early response upon ST1926 treatment. ST1926 enhanced de novo Cer synthesis via activation of ceramide synthase CerS(s) without inhibiting dihydroceramide desaturase, thereby accumulating Cer rather than the less bioactive dihydroceramide. Using labeling experiments with the unnatural 17-carbon sphinganine and measuring the generated Cer species, we showed that ST1926 preferentially induces the activities of a distinct set of CerS(s). We detected a delay in cell death response and interruption of Cer generation in response to ST1926 in Molt-4 cells overexpressing Bcl-2. These results highlight the potential role of ST1926 in inducing Cer levels, thus lowering the threshold for cell death in ATL cells.",['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],"['Ghandour, Botheina', 'Pisano, Claudio', 'Darwiche, Nadine', 'Dbaibo, Ghassan']","['Ghandour B', 'Pisano C', 'Darwiche N', 'Dbaibo G']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Biogem Research Institute, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Center for Infectious Diseases Research, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"[""0 (3-(4'-hydroxy-3'-adamantylbiphenyl-4-yl)acrylic acid)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.- (dihydroceramide desaturase)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', 'Cinnamates/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Oxidoreductases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",PMC7593536,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/10/13 12:12'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/13 12:12 [entrez]']","['226649 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20200050 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2020 Oct 30;40(10). pii: 226649. doi: 10.1042/BSR20200050.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adamantyl retinoid', '*Adult T cell leukemia', '*Ceramide', '*ST1926', '*T lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, several reports have shown that infections account for most of the therapy-related mortality during cancer treatment in AYAs. Thus, we hypothesized that chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is more severe in AYAs than in children, and the state of neutropenia was compared between children and AYAs using the D-index, a numerical value calculated from the duration and depth of neutropenia. PROCEDURE: This study retrospectively analyzed 95 patients newly diagnosed with ALL at our institution between 2007 and 2019. Of these, 81 were children (<15 years old) and 14 were AYAs (>/=15 years old). The D-index and duration of neutropenia during induction chemotherapy for ALL were compared between children and AYAs. RESULTS: The median D-index of children was significantly higher than that of AYAs (8187 vs 6446, respectively, P = .017). Moreover, the median duration of neutropenia was also significantly longer in children than in AYAs (24.0 days vs 11.5 days, respectively, P = .007).

For assays used to evaluate immune-mediated platelet (PLT) transfusion refractoriness, prozone-like phenomenon has been described in solid-phase human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody testing and can be mitigated by diluting samples or pretreating samples with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or dithiothreitol. Prozone phenomenon has not yet been described in solid-phase red blood cell (RBC) adherence PLT crossmatch assays. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old female with myeloid sarcoma and PLT transfusion refractoriness underwent repeated solid-phase PLT crossmatches; however, crossmatch-compatible PLTs units did not yield adequate PLT count responses. Class I HLA antibody testing with neat, diluted, and EDTA-pretreated serum demonstrated significant prozone-like effect and the presence of numerous high strength HLA antibodies. Based on this HLA antibody profile, HLA antigen-negative PLTs gave an adequate PLT count response. It was noted that the HLA types of her crossmatch-compatible PLTs were incompatible with her HLA antibody profile (eg, HLA-A2). With ABO-identical, HLA-A2-positive PLT units, a solid-phase PLT crossmatch was repeated using undiluted and diluted EDTA plasma. Undiluted EDTA plasma demonstrated negative or weakly positive PLT crossmatches while the diluted EDTA plasma demonstrated strongly positive PLT crossmatches. CONCLUSION: The prozone phenomenon can cause false-negative results in solid-phase RBC adherence PLT crossmatch assays, which can be mitigated with sample dilution.

Current smoking was associated with lower QOL at baseline (p < 0.01) and at FU3 (p < 0.01). Meeting the American Cancer Society PA guidelines was associated with better functional wellbeing and overall QOL at FU3 (p < 0.01). An increase in PA from baseline to FU3 was associated with improvement in physical, functional wellbeing and overall QOL at FU3 compared to baseline (p < 0.01). Thus, QOL in lymphoma survivors is associated with their health behaviors and active interventions to promote positive lifestyle changes in lymphoma survivors are needed.",,"['Pophali, Priyanka A', 'Larson, Melissa C', 'Rosenthal, Allison C', 'Robinson, Dennis', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Thanarajasingam, Gita', 'Call, Timothy', 'Allmer, Cristine', 'Farooq, Umar', 'Maurer, Matthew J', 'Yost, Kathleen J', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Thompson, Carrie A']","['Pophali PA', 'Larson MC', 'Rosenthal AC', 'Robinson D', 'Habermann TM', 'Thanarajasingam G', 'Call T', 'Allmer C', 'Farooq U', 'Maurer MJ', 'Yost KJ', 'Cerhan JR', 'Thompson CA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin- Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['KL2 TR002379/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Exercise', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma/epidemiology/therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors']",PMC8063513,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2020/10/13 08:45'],"['2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/13 08:45 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1830389 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Feb;62(2):271-280. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1830389.

One of these renowned approaches is Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs are synthetic receptors with the ability to be expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and are specifically designed to target a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) of interest. CAR-expressing T cells have the capability of proliferating and maintaining their immunological functionality in the recipient body but like any other therapeutic approach, the safety, effectiveness, and specificity enhancement of CAR T cells still lingers in the ambiguity arena. Genetic manipulation methods, expansion protocols, infusion dosage, and conditioning regimens are all among crucial factors which can affect the efficacy of CAR T cell-based cancer therapy. In this article, we discuss the studies that have focused on various aspects that affect the efficacy and persistence of CAR T-cell therapy for ALL treatment and provide a widespread overview regarding the practical approaches capable of elevating the effectiveness and lessening the relative toxicities attributed to it.",,"['Hashem Boroojerdi, Mohadese', 'Rahbarizadeh, Fatemeh', 'Safarzadeh Kozani, Pouya', 'Kamali, Elahe', 'Safarzadeh Kozani, Pooria']","['Hashem Boroojerdi M', 'Rahbarizadeh F', 'Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Kamali E', 'Safarzadeh Kozani P']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, P.O.

Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in the genetic characterization and risk stratification of precursor plasma cell disorders. Indeed, the clinical introduction of highly effective and well-tolerated drugs begs the question: would earlier therapeutic intervention with novel therapies in MGUS and SMM patients alter natural history, providing a potential curative option? In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of MGUS and SMM and current models for risk stratification that predict MGUS and SMM progression to MM. We further discuss genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution in MM and the interplay between tumor cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Finally, we provide an overview of the current recommendations for the management of MGUS and SMM and discuss the open controversies in the field in light of promising results from early intervention clinical trials.",,"['Ho, Matthew', 'Patel, Ashish', 'Goh, Chia Yin', 'Moscvin, Maria', 'Zhang, Li', 'Bianchi, Giada']","['Ho M', 'Patel A', 'Goh CY', 'Moscvin M', 'Zhang L', 'Bianchi G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'University College Dublin School of Medicine and Medical Science, Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. gbianchi1@BWH.HARVARD.EDU.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoldering Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/10/13 05:36'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/13 05:36 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01051-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01051-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3111-3125. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01051-x.

Immunotherapy offers an advantage in this setting. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T-cells have transformed care for patients with hematologic malignancies. CAR-T cells targeting CD-19 B-cell lymphoma cells have shown prominent activity in lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recently, the CAR-T cell platform for MM demonstrated therapeutic benefit. Hence, it is rapidly progressing. The most commonly tested target for MM is the B-cell maturation antigen. Complexities involved in the generation and use of CAR-T cells for MM include the identification of appropriate target antigens that are specific, and tumor type restricted, in addition to the optimization of CAR constructs to mitigate toxicities including cytokine release syndrome. CAR-T cells hold immense promise as a therapeutic modality for the treatment of MM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 110 children with a diagnosis of ALL treated with the Children's Oncology Group protocol from 1999 to 2014. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of 110 patients and acute complications of eligible and evaluable 105 patients were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 65 were male and 45 were female. The mean age at admission was 8.3 +/- 5.2 years. Ninety-seven patients (88.2%) had been diagnosed with pre-B-cell ALL, 11 (10%) with T-cell ALL, 1 (0.9%) with mixed phenotype acute leukemia, and 1 (0.9%) with mature B-cell acute leukemia. Of the 110 patients, 40 (36.3%) were in the standard-risk group and 70 (63.7%) were in high-risk group. Of the 110 patients, 105 had been followed up regularly and evaluated for acute complications. Infection was the most common complication (n = 93; 88.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (n = 29; 27.6%), neurologic (n = 28; 26.6%), metabolic/endocrine (n = 16; 15.2%), drug-related hypersensitivity (n = 16; 15.2%), avascular necrosis (n = 13; 12.3%), thrombotic (n = 11; 10.4%), severe psychiatric (n = 2; 1.9%), and various other (n = 12; 11.4%) complications. Of the 110 patients, 98 were assessed in terms of survival analysis. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were both 85.9% (standard error [SE], 3.6%). The relapse-free survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.9% (SE, 1.5%), 91.3% (SE, 3%), and 86.3% (SE, 3.7%), respectively.

Apoptosis is an essential feature for trophoblast invasion. Uncontrolled trophoblast apoptosis is related to some complicate pregnancies. Oxidative stress (OS) is an important inducer of trophoblast apoptosis. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to promote the activity of trophoblast cells and reduce OS-induced oxidative injury. We investigated the role and mechanism of CsA in oxidative stress-induced trophoblast cell apoptosis. METHODS: JEG-3 cells were cocultured with H2O2 and CsA. Cell viability and morphology were measured by MTT assay and DAPI staining. Cell apoptosis was tested with annexin V/PI staining. The expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and pro-caspase-3 was assayed by western blotting. The protein expression and phosphorylation of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (JNK, ERK1/2 and p38) were examined by western blotting. RESULTS: CsA increased the viability, alleviated morphological injury and reduced cell apoptosis of the H2O2-treated JEG-3 cells. CsA also attenuated the activation of p53, decreased the expression of Bax and cleavage of PARP, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 in the JEG-3 treated with H2O2. Furthermore, CsA reduced the activation of JNK and P38 but had no significant effect on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the H2O2-treated JEG-3 cells. Promoting the activation of JNK and p38 impaired the protective effect of CsA on OS-induced trophoblast apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that CsA protected trophoblast cells from OS-induced apoptosis via the inhibition of the p53 and JNK/p38 signaling pathways.",,"['He, Bin', 'Li, Qi Yue', 'Wu, Yuan Yuan', 'Ruan, Jing Ling', 'Teng, Xiao Ming', 'Li, Da Jin', 'Tang, Chuan Ling']","['He B', 'Li QY', 'Wu YY', 'Ruan JL', 'Teng XM', 'Li DJ', 'Tang CL']","['Department of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China.', 'Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital and Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, 200011, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 201204, China. ttangirl56@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['81300505/National Nature Science Foundation of China', '17ZR1422000/Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai', '81971383/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trophoblasts/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC7549196,,2020/10/14 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2020/10/13 05:28'],"['2020/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 05:28 [entrez]', '2020/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12958-020-00658-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12958-020-00658-0 [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2020 Oct 12;18(1):100. doi: 10.1186/s12958-020-00658-0.,100,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8724-2894'],20201012,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'MAPK', 'Oxidative stress', 'Trophoblast', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined enhanced anti-apoptosis identified in 3 newly established nucleoside analogue-resistant leukemic cell line variants and approaches to overcoming this resistance. METHODS: HL-60 human AML cells were used to develop the ara-C- or clofarabine (CAFdA)-resistant variants. The Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the Mcl-1 inhibitor alvocidib were tested to determine whether they could reverse these cells' resistance. RESULTS: A 10-fold ara-C-resistant HL-60 variant, a 4-fold CAFdA-resistant HL-60 variant, and a 30-fold CAFdA-resistant HL-60 variant were newly established. The variants demonstrated reduced deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase expression, but intact expression of surface transporters (hENT1, hENT2, hCNT3). The variants exhibited lower expression of intracellular nucleoside analogue triphosphates compared with non-variant HL-60 cells. The variants also overexpressed Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Venetoclax as a single agent was not cytotoxic to the resistant variants. Nevertheless, venetoclax with nucleoside analogs demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity against the variants. Alvocidib as a single agent was cytotoxic to the cells. However, alvocidib induced G1 arrest and suppressed the cytotoxicity of the co-administered nucleoside analogs. CONCLUSIONS: Three new nucleoside analogue-resistant HL-60 cell variants exhibited reduced production of intracellular analogue triphosphates and enhanced Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expressions.

METHODS: This was a single-institution retrospective study of 187 patients, ages 2 to 20 y, diagnosed with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma. We analyzed weight trends during induction therapy and predictors of weight loss. RESULTS: Significant weight loss (>/=5%) occurred in 17% of patients. Having high-risk disease, trisomy 21, overweight/obese status at the time of diagnosis, and/or hyperglycemia were positively associated with weight loss and negatively associated with weight gain during induction therapy.

In such cases, medications that target epigenetic processes could become an appealing supplementary approach. In this study, we tested the anti-leukemic activity of histone deacetylase inhibitor Belinostat (PXD101) and histone methyltransferase inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A combined with all-trans retinoic acid in APL cells NB4, promyelocytes resembling HL-60 cells and APL patients' cells. After HL-60 and NB4 cell treatment, ChIP-sequencing was performed using antibodies against hyper-acetylated histone H4. Hyper-acetylated histone H4 distribution peaks were compared in treated vs untreated HL-60 and NB4 cells. Results demonstrated that in treated HL-60 cells, the majority of peaks were distributed within the regions of proximal promoters, whereas in treated NB4 cells, hyper-acetylated histone H4 peaks were mainly localized in gene body regions. Further ChIP-seq data analysis revealed the changes in histone H4 hyper-acetylation in promoter/gene body regions of genes involved in cancer signaling pathways. In addition, quantitative gene expression analysis proved changes in various cellular pathways important for carcinogenesis. Epigenetic treatment down-regulated the expression of MTOR, LAMTOR1, WNT2B, VEGFR3, FGF2, FGFR1, TGFA, TGFB1, TGFBR1, PDGFA, PDGFRA and PDGFRB genes in NB4, HL-60 and APL patients' cells. In addition, effect of epigenetic treatment on protein expression of aforementioned signaling pathways was confirmed with mass spectrometry analysis.

Previously, we demonstrated that the mitophagy receptor BNIP3L/Nix is responsive to lipotoxicity and accumulates in response to a high-fat (HF) feeding. To provide a better understanding of this observation, we undertook gene expression array and shot-gun metabolomics studies in soleus muscle from rodents on an HF diet. Interestingly, we observed a modest reduction in several autophagy-related genes. Moreover, we observed alterations in the fatty acyl composition of cardiolipins and phosphatidic acids. Given the reported roles of these phospholipids and BNIP3L in mitochondrial dynamics, we investigated aberrant mitochondrial turnover as a mechanism of impaired myocyte insulin signaling. In a series of gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in rodent and human myotubes, we demonstrate that BNIP3L accumulation triggers mitochondrial depolarization, calcium-dependent activation of DNM1L/DRP1, and mitophagy. In addition, BNIP3L can inhibit insulin signaling through activation of MTOR-RPS6KB/p70S6 kinase inhibition of IRS1, which is contingent on phosphatidic acids and RHEB. Finally, we demonstrate that BNIP3L-induced mitophagy and impaired glucose uptake can be reversed by direct phosphorylation of BNIP3L by PRKA/PKA, leading to the translocation of BNIP3L from the mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol. These findings provide insight into the role of BNIP3L, mitochondrial turnover, and impaired myocyte insulin signaling during an overfed state when overall autophagy-related gene expression is reduced. Furthermore, our data suggest a mechanism by which exercise or pharmacological activation of PRKA may overcome myocyte insulin resistance.Abbreviations: BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BNIP3L/Nix: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like; DNM1L/DRP1: dynamin 1-like; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; IRS1: insulin receptor substrate 1; MAP1LC3A/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha; MFN1: mitofusin 1; MFN2: mitofusin 2; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; OPA1: OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase; PDE4i: phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor; PLD1: phospholipase D1; PLD6: phospholipase D family member 6; PRKA/PKA: protein kinase, AMP-activated; PRKCD/PKCdelta: protein kinase C, delta; PRKCQ/PKCtheta: protein kinase C, theta; RHEB: Ras homolog enriched in brain; RPS6KB/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; YWHAB/14-3-3beta: tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein beta.",,"['da Silva Rosa, Simone C', 'Martens, Matthew D', 'Field, Jared T', 'Nguyen, Lucas', 'Kereliuk, Stephanie M', 'Hai, Yan', 'Chapman, Donald', 'Diehl-Jones, William', 'Aliani, Michel', 'West, Adrian R', 'Thliveris, James', 'Ghavami, Saeid', 'Rampitsch, Christof', 'Dolinsky, Vernon W', 'Gordon, Joseph W']","['da Silva Rosa SC', 'Martens MD', 'Field JT', 'Nguyen L', 'Kereliuk SM', 'Hai Y', 'Chapman D', 'Diehl-Jones W', 'Aliani M', 'West AR', 'Thliveris J', 'Ghavami S', 'Rampitsch C', 'Dolinsky VW', 'Gordon JW']","['Departments of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'The Diabetes Research Envisioned and Accomplished in Manitoba (DREAM) Theme, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Departments of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'The Diabetes Research Envisioned and Accomplished in Manitoba (DREAM) Theme, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Departments of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'The Diabetes Research Envisioned and Accomplished in Manitoba (DREAM) Theme, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'The Diabetes Research Envisioned and Accomplished in Manitoba (DREAM) Theme, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Physiology and Pathophysiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'Faculty of Health Disciplines, Athabasca University, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Human Nutritional Science.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Physiology and Pathophysiology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'Departments of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'Departments of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'Agriculture and Agrifood Canada, Morden, Manitoba, Canada.', 'The Diabetes Research Envisioned and Accomplished in Manitoba (DREAM) Theme, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'Departments of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'The Diabetes Research Envisioned and Accomplished in Manitoba (DREAM) Theme, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."", 'Biological Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.', 'College of Nursing, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,,IM,,PMC8496715,,2020/10/13 06:00,2020/10/13 06:00,['2020/10/12 17:08'],"['2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/12 17:08 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2020.1821548 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2021 Sep;17(9):2257-2272. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2020.1821548.

METHODS: Fee-for-service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA) claims data were used to identify adults with a CLL/SLL diagnosis initiating 1 L ibrutinib single agent or CIT between 4 March 2016 and 30 September 2017 (index date). HRU and costs (Medicare spending) were evaluated during 1 L Oncology Care Model (1 L OCM) episodes (the first six months post-index) and over the observed 1 L duration. Patients' baseline characteristics were balanced using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Mean monthly cost differences (MMCDs) obtained from ordinary least square regressions were used to compare costs between ibrutinib and CIT cohorts. RESULTS: In the Medicare FFS dataset (ibrutinib: n = 2014; CIT: n = 2050), ibrutinib patients incurred significantly higher monthly pharmacy costs (1 L OCM: MMCD = $4878, p < .0001; 1 L duration: MMCD= $4892, p < .0001) that were fully offset by lower monthly medical costs (1 L OCM: MMCD= -$8289, p < .0001; 1 L duration: MMCD=-$5888, p < .0001), yielding a monthly total healthcare cost reduction (1 L OCM: MMCD=-$3411, p < .0001; 1 L duration: MMCD=-$996, p < .0001) relative to CIT patients. In the MA dataset (ibrutinib: n = 293; CIT: n = 303), ibrutinib was also associated with a monthly total healthcare cost reduction (1 L OCM: MMCD=-$10,459; 1 L duration: MMCD=-$5492). CONCLUSIONS: In Medicare patients with CLL/SLL, 1 L ibrutinib single agent was associated with total monthly cost savings relative to 1 L CIT, driven by lower monthly medical costs that fully offset higher monthly pharmacy costs.",,"['Huang, Qing', 'Emond, Bruno', 'Lafeuille, Marie-Helene', 'Gupta, Deepshekhar', 'Lefebvre, Patrick', 'Sundaram, Murali', 'Mato, Anthony']","['Huang Q', 'Emond B', 'Lafeuille MH', 'Gupta D', 'Lefebvre P', 'Sundaram M', 'Mato A']","['Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Horsham, PA, USA.', 'Analysis Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Analysis Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Analysis Group Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA.', 'Analysis Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Horsham, PA, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Cost Savings', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/economics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Medicare/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Piperidines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,,2020/10/13 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/10/12 17:08'],"['2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/12 17:08 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2020.1835851 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2020 Dec;36(12):2009-2018. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2020.1835851.

However, collection of optimal volumes for adequate cytomorphologic evaluation is not standardized. Our study investigated optimal CSF volumes that result in a significant diagnostic result. METHODS: A total of 4114 samples were retrospectively identified from 2014 to 2018, and 2557 samples had concurrent flow cytometry (FC) study. Each specimen was grouped as unsatisfactory, negative, atypical, or positive. Positive samples were grouped as either solid tumors, leukemia, or lymphoma by the type of malignancy detected. Demographic data as well as CSF source was recorded. Specimens with FC were separated by detection on cytology and/or FC. A t-test and ANOVA test were used to compare the average volumes for each group. RESULTS: Average volumes for negative, atypical, and positive samples are 7.48 mL (95% CI: 7.33, 7.63), 7.97 mL (95% CI: 7.37, 8.57), and 8.44 mL (95% CI: 7.46, 9.43), respectively. Average volumes for solid tumors, leukemia, and lymphoma positive samples are 12.0 mL (95% CI: 9.11, 14.89), 6.73 mL (95% CI: 5.94, 7.53), and 8.44 mL (95% CI: 6.78, 10.09). For cases with FC, the volumes are 10.11 mL (95% CI: 9.28, 10.96), 7.28 mL (95% CI: 6.87, 7.70), and 6.86 mL (95% CI: 6.25, 7.49) for positive cytology only, positive cytology/FC, and negative for both, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher volumes produce better results for analysis. We recommend an optimal volume of 8.44 mL for cytologic work-up of malignancies.

Methods This retrospective investigation included 71 patients with leukemia and lymphoma before chemotherapy and 36 healthy controls. All participants underwent echocardiographic examination before initiation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Results LV global longitudinal strain (- 20.2 +/- 1.7% vs. - 17.9 +/- 3.0%, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the patients with hematological malignancies than in controls. There was no difference in LV circumferential and radial strains between two observed groups. Subendocardial and subepicardial longitudinal strains were significantly lower in the patients with hematological malignancies (- 20.5 +/- 3.6% vs. - 22.5 +/- 3.8%, p = 0.001 for subendocardial strain; - 18.0 +/- 1.5% vs. - 15.8 +/- 2.6%, p < 0.001 for subepicardial strain).

To address these questions, we retrospectively analyzed 93 MNs patients (78 AML, 11 MDS, 4 CMML) with IDH1/2 mutations treated with AZA. After a median of 5 cycles of AZA, overall response rate was 28% (including 15% complete remission) and median OS was 12.3 months (significantly shorter in AML compared to MDS/CMML patients). In multivariate analysis of AML patients, DNMT3A mutation was associated with shorter OS while IDH1/2 mutation subtypes had no independent impact. No difference was observed in serum 2HG levels upon AZA treatment between responding and refractory patients suggesting that serum 2HG cannot be used as a surrogate marker of AZA response.",,"['Willekens, C', 'Rahme, R', 'Duchmann, M', 'Vidal, V', 'Saada, V', 'Broutin, S', 'Delahousse, J', 'Renneville, A', 'Marceau, A', 'Clappier, E', 'Uzunov, M', 'Rossignol, J', 'Pascal, L', 'Simon, L', 'Micol, J B', 'Pasquier, F', 'Raffoux, E', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Quivoron, C', 'Itzykson, R', 'Penard-Lacronique, V', 'Paci, A', 'Fenaux, P', 'Attar, E C', 'Frattini, M', 'Braun, T', 'Ades, L', 'De Botton, S']","['Willekens C', 'Rahme R', 'Duchmann M', 'Vidal V', 'Saada V', 'Broutin S', 'Delahousse J', 'Renneville A', 'Marceau A', 'Clappier E', 'Uzunov M', 'Rossignol J', 'Pascal L', 'Simon L', 'Micol JB', 'Pasquier F', 'Raffoux E', 'Preudhomme C', 'Quivoron C', 'Itzykson R', 'Penard-Lacronique V', 'Paci A', 'Fenaux P', 'Attar EC', 'Frattini M', 'Braun T', 'Ades L', 'De Botton S']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U944, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Avicenne, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bobigny, France."", 'Departement de Biologie et Pathologie medicales, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Departement de Biologie et Pathologie medicales, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Departement de Biologie et Pathologie medicales, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ""Centre de Biologie-Pathologie, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, France."", ""Centre de Biologie-Pathologie, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", ""Hematologie, Groupement des Hopitaux de l'Institut Catholique de Lille, Lille, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital universitaire d'Amiens - Picardie, Amiens, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U944, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Centre de Biologie-Pathologie, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, France."", 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U944, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Departement de Biologie et Pathologie medicales, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U944, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Avicenne, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bobigny, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France."", 'Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U944, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U1170, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

WDSTS is characterized by a distinctive facial phenotype, hypertrichosis, short stature, developmental delay, intellectual disability, congenital malformations, and skeletal anomalies. Recently, a few patients have been reported having abnormal skeletal development of the cervical spine. Here we describe 11 such individuals, all with KMT2A de novo loss-of-function variants: 10 showed craniovertebral junction anomalies, while an 11th patient had a cervical abnormality in C7. By evaluating clinical and diagnostic imaging data we characterized these anomalies, which consist primarily of fused cervical vertebrae, C1 and C2 abnormalities, small foramen magnum and Chiari malformation type I. Craniovertebral anomalies in WDSTS patients have been largely disregarded so far, but the increasing number of reports suggests that they may be an intrinsic feature of this syndrome. Specific investigation strategies should be considered for early identification and prevention of craniovertebral junction complications in WDSTS patients.",['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Giangiobbe, Sara', 'Caraffi, Stefano Giuseppe', 'Ivanovski, Ivan', 'Maini, Ilenia', 'Pollazzon, Marzia', 'Rosato, Simonetta', 'Trimarchi, Gabriele', 'Lauriello, Anna', 'Marinelli, Maria', 'Nicoli, Davide', 'Baldo, Chiara', 'Laurie, Steven', 'Flores-Daboub, Josue', 'Provenzano, Aldesia', 'Andreucci, Elena', 'Peluso, Francesca', 'Rizzo, Renata', 'Stewart, Helen', 'Lachlan, Katherine', 'Bayat, Allan', 'Napoli, Manuela', 'Carboni, Giorgia', 'Baker, Janice', 'Mendel, Alyssa', 'Piatelli, Gianluca', 'Pantaleoni, Chiara', 'Mattina, Teresa', 'Prontera, Paolo', 'Mendelsohn, Nancy J', 'Giglio, Sabrina', 'Zuffardi, Orsetta', 'Garavelli, Livia']","['Giangiobbe S', 'Caraffi SG', 'Ivanovski I', 'Maini I', 'Pollazzon M', 'Rosato S', 'Trimarchi G', 'Lauriello A', 'Marinelli M', 'Nicoli D', 'Baldo C', 'Laurie S', 'Flores-Daboub J', 'Provenzano A', 'Andreucci E', 'Peluso F', 'Rizzo R', 'Stewart H', 'Lachlan K', 'Bayat A', 'Napoli M', 'Carboni G', 'Baker J', 'Mendel A', 'Piatelli G', 'Pantaleoni C', 'Mattina T', 'Prontera P', 'Mendelsohn NJ', 'Giglio S', 'Zuffardi O', 'Garavelli L']","['Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', ""Unita Operativa di Psichiatria e Psicologia dell'Infanzia e dell'Adolescenza, DAI-SMDP, AUSL Parma, Parma, Italy."", 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Mother and Child Health Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Molecular Biology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'UOC Laboratorio di Genetica Umana, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy.', ""Clinical Genomics, Centre Nacional d'Analisi Genomica, Centre de Regulacio Genomica, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Division of Pediatric Clinical Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', ""Medical Genetics Unit, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy."", ""Medical Genetics Unit, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy."", ""Medical Genetics Unit, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy."", 'Neurobiology and Molecular Medicine, IRCCS Stella Maris, Pisa, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Oxford Centre for Genomic Medicine, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.', 'Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Southampton University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Genetics and Personalized Medicine, Danish Epilepsy Centre, Dianalund, Denmark.', 'Neuroradiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Radiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', ""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", 'Coordination of Rare Diseases at Sanford (CoRDS), Sanford Research, Sioux Falls, SD, USA.', 'UOC Neurochirurgia, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy.', 'Developmental Neurology Department, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico ""C.

Because it is considered an immunosuppressant, continuation of ibrutinib is often debated when patients have an active infection, and this becomes an especially difficult decision in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we describe a patient with CLL who was on ibrutinib then developed severe COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation. We elected to continue ibrutinib the same day he was intubated, reasoning that BTK inhibition in myeloid immune cells has been shown to reduce or even reverse influenza-mediated acute lung injury and that ITK inhibition in T cells has correlated with reduction in viral replication, and therefore may have an advantage in this setting. Ibrutinib also has been shown to block Src family kinases, which potentially could result in reduction of viral entry and the inflammatory cytokine response in the lungs. The patient was extubated after 9 days with a complex hospital course and eventually discharged on room air. The only way to rationally inform these decisions and explore similar potentially promising leads in this pandemic is to conduct carefully done clinical trials.","['(c) 2020 The Authors. eJHaem published by British Society for Haematology and', 'John Wiley & Sons Ltd.']","['Lin, Adam Yuh', 'Cuttica, Michael J', 'Ison, Michael G', 'Gordon, Leo I']","['Lin AY', 'Cuttica MJ', 'Ison MG', 'Gordon LI']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Robert H.

The FLT3 gene participates in hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. FLT3 mutations are recurrent in AML and influence prognosis. In Mexican pediatric AML patients, FLT3 mutational profile, and their clinical impact have not been evaluated. Aim of the study: This study aimed to identify the profile of FLT3 mutations in pediatric patients with de novo AML and to assess their possible influence on overall survival (OS) and other clinical features. Methods: Massive parallel target sequencing of FLT3 was performed in 80 patients. Results: FLT3 mutations [internal tandem duplication (ITD) or tyrosine kinase domain (TKD)] were identified in 24% of them. OS was significantly lower in FLT3 (POS) cases than in FLT3 (NEG) (p = 0.03). The average OS for FLT3 (POS) was 1.2 vs. 2.2 years in FLT3 (NEG). There were no significant differences in the children's sex, age, percentage of blasts in bone marrow aspirate, or white blood cell count in peripheral blood at diagnosis between both groups. No differences were identified stratifying by the mutational load (high > 0.4) or type of mutation. The negative effect of FLT3 mutations was also observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Conclusions: FLT3 mutational profile is described in Mexican pediatric AML patients for the first time. Mutated FLT3 negatively impacts the outcome of AML patients, even considering the APL group. The clinical benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the FLT3 (POS) pediatric patients needs to be assessed in clinical trials. FLT3 testing may contribute to better risk stratification in our pediatric AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Molina Garay, Carrillo Sanchez, Flores Lagunes, Jimenez', 'Olivares, Munoz Rivas,

Iron metabolism is strictly regulated and the related therapeutic approaches to date have been to restrict iron availability to tumor cells. However, since a new form of iron-catalyzed cell death has been described, termed ferroptosis, and subsequently better understood, iron excess is thought to represent an opportunity to selectively kill leukemic cells and spare normal hematopoietic cells, based on their differential iron needs. This review summarizes the physiology of iron metabolism and its deregulation in leukemia, the known ferrotoposis pathways, and therapeutic strategies to target the altered iron metabolism in leukemia for the purposes of initiating ferroptosis in these cancer cells.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Grignano, Birsen, Chapuis and Bouscary.']","['Grignano, Eric', 'Birsen, Rudy', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Grignano E', 'Birsen R', 'Chapuis N', 'Bouscary D']","['Universite de Paris, Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Centre-Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Universite de Paris, Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Centre-Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Universite de Paris, Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Centre-Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie biologique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Universite de Paris, Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Centre-Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7530268,,2020/10/13 06:00,2020/10/13 06:01,['2020/10/12 05:32'],"['2020/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 05:32 [entrez]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.586530 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 18;10:586530. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.586530. eCollection 2020.,586530,,20200918,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'ferritinophagy', 'ferroptosis', 'iron', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypothesizing that BRAFi triggered excessive MEK-ERK signaling in the MBL/CLL clone via the CRAF/RAS complex as previously described for BRAFi-induced cancers, BRAFi was discontinued inducing a rapid remission of the CLL on MEKi alone. Liquid biopsy monitoring showed a continuous increase of the MBL/CLL clone from the start of BRAFi/MEKi treatment followed by a rapid decline upon BRAFi withdrawal. Next-generation sequencing of a cohort of patients with MBL and monoclonal gammopathy of unclear significance (MGUS) revealed that almost one third of these cases harbored RAS mutations. In view of the population frequency of lymphatic pre-malignant conditions and the prevalence of RAS mutations in such cases, vigilant surveillance remains critical in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Simnica, Ittrich, Bockemeyer, Stein and Binder.']","['Simnica, Donjete', 'Ittrich, Harald', 'Bockemeyer, Carsten', 'Stein, Alexander', 'Binder, Mascha']","['Simnica D', 'Ittrich H', 'Bockemeyer C', 'Stein A', 'Binder M']","['Department of Internal Medicine IV, Oncology/Hematology, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum/UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum/UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum/UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Hematology-Oncology Practice Hamburg (HOPE), Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Oncology/Hematology, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum/UCCH, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7517330,,2020/10/13 06:00,2020/10/13 06:01,['2020/10/12 05:32'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 05:32 [entrez]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.540030 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 11;10:540030. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.540030. eCollection 2020.,540030,,20200911,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF inhibition', 'RAS mutation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'hairy cell leukemia', 'monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The memory phenotype of CAR-T has been correlated positively with a therapeutic effect on and prognosis of cancer. Method: The proliferation rates of novel CAR-T was determined by cell counting. The phenotypes of CAR-T cells were then detected by flow cytometry. The cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro was investigated by lactate dehydrogenase assay and luciferase assay. The cytokines secreted during these assays were determined by the cytometric bead array assay. The antitumor ability in vivo was evaluated in NOG mice. Results: Co-expression of an LRP6 full-length protein with anti-CD19 CAR significantly improved the memory phenotype of CAR-positive T-cells by enhancing the wnt signaling pathway. As compared with anti-CD19 CAR-T, anti-CD19 CAR-T-LRP6 exhibited more robust cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, albeit fewer cytokines were released in vitro. Moreover, the longer survival rate and robust expansion in vivo of anti-CD19 CAR-T-LRP6 cells were found to be effective in inhibiting cancer recurrence. Conclusions: CAR co-expressed with LRP6 could sustain the memory phenotype that enabled permanent relief and may further assist in the development of potent and durable T-cell therapeutics.","['Copyright (c) 2020 He, Tan, Wei, Wan and Yang.']","['He, Ping', 'Tan, Zhongqiu', 'Wei, Zhongheng', 'Wan, Cheng-Liang', 'Yang, Shan-Shan']","['He P', 'Tan Z', 'Wei Z', 'Wan CL', 'Yang SS']","['School of Laboratory Medicine, Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Guangxi, China.', ""Department of General Surgery, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an Second People's Hospital, The Affiliated Huai'an Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Huai'an, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7522530,,2020/10/13 06:00,2020/10/13 06:01,['2020/10/12 05:31'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01346 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 15;10:1346. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01346. eCollection 2020.,1346,,20200915,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'CAR-T cells', 'T memory cell', 'tumor immunotherapy', 'tumor treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening for mutations in patients with AML has shown that in many cases genes carrying mutations are involved in the alternate splicing of mRNA. These include members of the Serine Arginine (SR) family of splicing factors, as well as components of the spliceosome. Mutations in associated genes also affect the function of members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). These mutations in splicing factors can lead to changes in the expression of different isoforms whose splicing is controlled by these splicing factors. These different isoforms may have completely different functions, for example, members of the BCl-2 family are alternately spliced to give rise to pro and anti-apoptotic members. Mutations in the splicing factors that control the splicing of these mRNAs can lead to changes in the expression level of these isoforms. In this review we will examine the mechanics of the regulation of the various splice isoforms and how this drives the development of tumors.

Despite the remaining questions regarding which factors may be considered predictive for TFR, treatment interruption is a safe option provided that adequate molecular monitoring is available, with prompt re-initiation of TKIs as soon as major molecular response has been lost. Data from ongoing trials should help refine decisions as to which patients are the best candidates to attempt TKI discontinuation, frequency of a safe monitoring, optimal strategies to sustain ongoing TFR and increase the number of patients who can access to discontinuation programs.",['(c)Copyright: the Author(s).'],"['Molica, Matteo', 'Noguera, Nelida I', 'Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cerchione, Claudio', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta']","['Molica M', 'Noguera NI', 'Trawinska MM', 'Martinelli G', 'Cerchione C', 'Abruzzese E']","['Hematology, S.

The presence of multiple comorbidities makes geriatric patients ineligible for most clinical trials. Racial diversity may vary by geographical location and socio-economically backward areas may have a very different racial mix. The increase in cancer incidence in geriatric patients' raises the question of applicability of the results is such clinical trials. This study also explores the representation of different races in phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the past 10 years. Methods: Data about Phase III trials was extracted from the clinical trials.gov for 3 common solid organs and 3 hematological malignancies [breast, colon, lung, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)]. The time period studied was for the past 10 years and included only adult patients (>/=18 years). The age and race distribution of the patient population in these trials were extracted and analyzed. Results: Geriatric patients and minorities are under-represented in all phase III cancer clinical trials. The range of the proportion of geriatric patients varied from 10% to 40%. African American and Asian patients are under-represented in all phase III cancer clinical trials. Conclusions: The results of phase III clinical trials that are currently conducted on non-geriatric and Caucasian patient population may not meaningfully be applicable to geriatric patients and minorities.

However, CRIP1 expression and its regulation are little known in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression and regulation of CRIP1 and the clinical implications of CRIP1 aberration in AML. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to detect the level of CRIP1 expression in 138 AML patients and 38 controls. CRIP1 methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. Five public available AML datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were further analyzed. The level of CRIP1 expression was up-regulated in AML patients compared with controls (P = 0.045). CRIP1 (high) patients had a significantly lower complete remission (CR) rate than CRIP1 (low) patients (P = 0.020). CRIP1 (high) group had a shorter overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) than CRIP1 (low) group in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients (P = 0.007 and 0.012, respectively). Multivariate analysis further confirmed that high CRIP1 expression was an independent risk factor for LFS in CN-AML patients (P = 0.005). However, we found that CRIP1 expression was not associated with the status of its promoter, which was nearly fully unmethylated both in controls and AML patients. Furthermore, our results were validated using the published GEO datasets and TCGA datasets.

To date, it is the unique published example of a virus able to form a biofilm at the surface of infected cells. Deeply studied in bacteria, bacterial biofilms represent multicellular assemblies of bacteria in contact with a surface and shielded by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Microbial lifestyle in biofilms, either viral or bacterial, is opposed structurally and physiologically to an isolated lifestyle, in which viruses or bacteria freely float in their environment. HTLV-1 biofilm formation is believed to be promoted by viral proteins, mainly Tax, through remodeling of the ECM of the infected cells. HTLV-1 biofilm has been linked to cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. However, in comparison to bacterial biofilms, very little is known on kinetics of viral biofilm formation or dissemination, but also on its pathophysiological roles, such as escape from immune detection or therapeutic strategies, as well as promotion of leukemogenesis. The switch between production of cell-free isolated virions and cell-associated viral biofilm, although not fully apprehended yet, remains a key step to understand HTLV-1 infection and pathogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Maali, Journo, Mahieux and Dutartre.']","['Maali, Yousef', 'Journo, Chloe', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Dutartre, Helene']","['Maali Y', 'Journo C', 'Mahieux R', 'Dutartre H']","['CIRI - Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm, U1111, CNRS, UMR5308, ENS Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'CIRI - Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm, U1111, CNRS, UMR5308, ENS Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'CIRI - Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm, U1111, CNRS, UMR5308, ENS Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'CIRI - Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inserm, U1111, CNRS, UMR5308, ENS Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC7523422,,2020/10/13 06:00,2020/10/13 06:01,['2020/10/12 05:28'],"['2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 05:28 [entrez]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.02041 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Sep 15;11:2041. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.02041. eCollection 2020.,2041,,20200915,['NOTNLM'],"['cell-cell transmission', 'extracellular matrix', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'pathogenesis', 'viral biofilm']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus here on the transition from SCN to pre-leukemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Stochastic mathematical models have been conceived that attempt to explain the transition of SCN to MDS, in the most parsimonious way, using extensions of standard processes of population genetics and population dynamics, such as the branching and the Moran processes. We previously presented a hypothesis of the SCN to MDS transition, which involves directional selection and recurrent mutation, to explain the distribution of ages at onset of MDS or AML. Based on experimental and clinical data and a model of human hematopoiesis, a range of probable values of the selection coefficient s and mutation rate mu have been determined. These estimates lead to predictions of the age at onset of MDS or AML, which are consistent with the clinical data. In the current paper, based on data extracted from published literature, we seek to provide an independent validation of these estimates. We proceed with two purposes in mind: (i) to determine the ballpark estimates of the selection coefficients and verify their consistency with those previously obtained and (ii) to provide possible insight into the role of recurrent mutations of the G-CSF receptor in the SCN to MDS transition.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Dinh, Corey and Kimmel.']","['Dinh, Khanh N', 'Corey, Seth J', 'Kimmel, Marek']","['Dinh KN', 'Corey SJ', 'Kimmel M']","['Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics and Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Departments of Pediatric and Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Departments of Statistics and Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Engineering, Gliwice, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,,PMC7527629,,2020/10/13 06:00,2020/10/13 06:01,['2020/10/12 05:27'],"['2020/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 05:27 [entrez]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2020.00806 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2020 Sep 17;11:806. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2020.00806. eCollection 2020.,806,,20200917,['NOTNLM'],"['G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR)', 'Moran model', 'clinical data', 'myeloid neoplasia', 'recurrent mutation', 'selective advantage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study was a single-center, retrospective review designed to assess the frequency of bacteremia with levofloxacin prophylaxis compared with historical controls that used other, clinician-directed antibacterial prophylaxis. The primary outcome of the study was microbiologically documented bacteremia. Secondary outcomes included febrile neutropenia, clinically documented infection, duration of neutropenia, treatment antibiotic exposure days, Clostridioides difficile infection, and infection-related mortality. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients included, 24 patients with 32 hospital admissions received levofloxacin and 36 patients with 48 hospital admissions received clinician-directed prophylaxis. There was no difference found in the frequency of bacteremia between levofloxacin and clinician-directed prophylaxis (15.6% vs 10.4%, p = 0.49). There was no difference in the incidence of febrile neutropenia, clinically documented infection, treatment antibiotic exposure days, or 30-day infection-related mortality between the 2 groups. The levofloxacin group had a longer mean duration of neutropenia compared with clinician-directed prophylaxis (26.8 days vs 16.4 days, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in bacteremia between levofloxacin prophylaxis and clinician-directed prophylaxis in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia or those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Levofloxacin prophylaxis is an appropriate alternative for the prevention of serious bacterial infections in this patient population, although further studies are needed to confirm these results.","['Copyright Pediatric Pharmacy Association.

Here, several cell-signaling molecules whose genes are expressed in the endometrium during d 5 to 7 after estrus were tested for the ability to affect the competence of the embryo for further development and the characteristics of the resultant blastocysts. Molecules tested were C-natriuretic peptide (CNP), IL-8, bovine morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). None of the cell-signaling molecules tested improved the competence of the embryo to become a blastocyst; in fact, BMP-4 decreased development. All molecules modified attributes of the blastocyst formed in culture. In particular, CNP increased the number of cells in the ICM, whereas IL-8 decreased inner cell mass cell numbers and tended to increase the proportion of blastocysts that were hatching or hatched. In addition, BMP-4 decreased the proportion of blastocysts that were hatching. Interleukin-6 and, to a lesser extent, LIF activated the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in the inner cell mass, and LIF increased the percent of cells in the blastocyst that were positive for both NANOG and phosphorylated (activated) STAT3. In conclusion, our results indicate that CNP, IL-8, IL-6, LIF, and BMP-4 can modify embryonic development of the cow in a manner that affects characteristics of the resultant blastocyst. Further research is required to understand how these changes in characteristics of the blastocyst would affect competence of the embryo to establish and maintain pregnancy.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study, to identify the genes involved in the CRC clinical outcomes, the expression of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 3 (BCL-3) gene in patients with colorectal cancer was investigated along with serum level of beta-catenin. In this study, samples of 23 patients with colorectal cancer were prepared. mRNA was extracted and then cDNA was prepared for evaluation of PCR. Then, with specific primers for the BCL3, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR test was performed. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the serum level of beta-catenin. In this study, 23 men with an average age of years were included. BCL-3 expression in tumor tissue was significantly higher than its level in healthy tissue (P=0.021). BCL-3 expression at stage 0 of the tumor was significantly lower than at all other stages (P&lt;0.05), and the comparison between the rest of the CRC stages was not significant (P&gt;0.05). The median of serum beta-catenin levels in the patients was 32.83 (22.45, 46.09). There was no significant difference in the amount of serum beta-catenin between all 5 stages of the disease and in terms of lymph node metastasis. There were no relationships between age, BMI, smoking history, familial CRC history, and BCL-3 or beta-catenin serum levels (P&gt;0.05). In this study, the expression of the BCL-3 gene in tumor specimens was high. It can be said that the BCL-3 gene can act as one of the genes involved in colorectal cancer, along with some genes such as beta-catenin. While BCL-3 was associated with a higher stage of CRC, beta-catenin didn't show such a relationship with CRC.",,"['Zhang, Shanhong', 'Yin, Changqing']","['Zhang S', 'Yin C']","['Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, No.467, Zhongshan Road, Shahekou District, Dalian,116023, Liaoning Province, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, No.467, Zhongshan Road, Shahekou District, Dalian,116023, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein/*genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'beta Catenin/*genetics']",,,2020/10/13 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/10/12 05:20'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/12 05:20 [entrez]', '2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2020 Jul 31;66(5):87-91.,87-91,,20200731,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-3', 'colorectal cancer', 'beta-catenin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of UDA on Jurkat and Raji cell proliferation was examined by MTS assay. Distribution of cell cycle phases was determined by PI staining and apoptosis was examined with annexin V/PI and western blot. Results showed UDA treatment reduced cell proliferation in cells by inducing apoptosis. PI staining was associated with a higher percentage of the cell population in sub G1. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 dependent apoptosis occurred in Jurkat cells. Generally, UDA treatment resulted in cell death in ALL cell lines and induced apoptosis in the T-ALL cell line, Jurkat, through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

K562 and KCL-22 cells were modeled for imatinib resistance, so as to analyze the effects of inhibiting Twist1 and the pathway on the therapeutic effect of imatinib on imatinib-resistant CML cells, and to find the mechanism of action of Twist1 on affecting the resistance. After the CML cells were successfully resistant to imatinib, Twist1 expression increased again in the cells and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was further activated. After the silence of the Twist1 expression, the imatinib-resistant CML cells were more sensitive to imatinib, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited, and the expression level of p-AKT protein significantly reduced. According to further experiments, imatinib enhanced its inhibitory effect on the growth of the imatinib-resistant CML cells after the activation of the pathway was inhibited by an LY3023414 inhibitor. In conclusion, Twist1 and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are over-activated during the formation of the CML cells resistant to imatinib.

This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability and outcomes of pharmacist-led interventions on DRPs encountered by CML patients. METHODS: This study included participants from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial which was conducted to evaluate the effects of pharmacist-led interventions on CML patients treated with TKIs. Participants were recruited and followed up in the haematology clinics of two hospitals in Malaysia from March 2017 to January 2019. A pharmacist identified DRPs and helped to resolve them. Patients were followed-up for six months, and their DRPs were assessed based on the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe Classification for DRP v7.0. The identified DRPs, the pharmacist's interventions, and the acceptance and outcomes of the interventions were recorded. A Poisson multivariable regression model was used to analyse factors associated with the number of identified DRPs per participant. RESULTS: A total of 198 DRPs were identified from 65 CML patients. The median number of DRPs per participants was 3 (interquartile range: 2, 4). Most participants (97%) had at least one DRP, which included adverse drug events (45.5%), treatment ineffectiveness (31.5%) and patients' treatment concerns or dissatisfaction (23%). The 228 causes of DRPs identified comprised the following: lack of disease or treatment information, or outcome monitoring (47.8%), inappropriate drug use processes (23.2%), inappropriate patient behaviour (19.9%), suboptimal drug selection (6.1%), suboptimal dose selection (2.6%) and logistic issues in dispensing (0.4%). The number of concomitant medications was significantly associated with the number of DRPs (adjusted Odds Ratio: 1.100; 95% CI: 1.005, 1.205; p = 0.040). Overall, 233 interventions were made. These included providing patient education on disease states or TKI-related side effects (75.1%) and recommending appropriate instructions for taking medications (7.7%). Of the 233 interventions, 94.4% were accepted and 83.7% were implemented by the prescriber or patient. A total of 154 DRPs (77.3%) were resolved. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacist-led interventions among CML patients managed to identify various DRPs, were well accepted by both TKI prescribers and patients, and had a high success rate of resolving the DRPs.",,"['Tan, Bee Kim', 'Chua, Siew Siang', 'Chen, Li-Chia', 'Chang, Kian Meng', 'Balashanker, Sharmini', 'Bee, Ping Chong']","['Tan BK', 'Chua SS', 'Chen LC', 'Chang KM', 'Balashanker S', 'Bee PC']","[""School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Taylor's University, Subang Jaya, Malaysia."", 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, 37447University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', ""School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Taylor's University, Subang Jaya, Malaysia."", 'Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, 26691Ministry of Health Malaysia, Ampang Hospital, Ampang Jaya, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, 37447University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)'],IM,"['*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations', '*Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacists']",,,2020/10/13 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/10/12 05:19'],"['2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/12 05:19 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220964539 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Oct;27(7):1644-1656. doi: 10.1177/1078155220964539.

Length of time off of therapy is related to poorer outcomes. To date the dose at which most children tolerate these agents without drops in blood counts has not been identified. This study attempts to determine the maximum tolerated dose of both 6MP/MTX. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 77 ALL children, median age 4.5 years. Time to first interruption and dose, along with total number of interruptions were collected. Absolute neutrophil and platelet counts recorded at time of interruption. Subgroup analysis of age, sex, diagnosis and risk stratification were also completed. REB approval was gained. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients that were studied, 9 of them had no treatment interruptions. Descriptive statistics are reported using Strata software. The mean number of interruptions during maintenance was 3.2, the mean time to first interruption was 149.8 days. The mean dose percent of MTX and 6MP at first interruption was 94.4% and 106% respectively. Maintenance therapy was interrupted independent of age, sex, diagnosis or disease risk stratification. CONCLUSION: Few patients complete maintenance therapy without interruptions at the current dose escalation schedules outlined by the Children's Oncology Group protocols. The interruptions are due in part to intolerance of dose escalations of MTX and 6 MP above 100%. Future research should investigate doses of 6MP and MTX in maintenance therapy in relation to leukemia outcomes.",,"['Whiley, A C', 'Price, V', 'MacDonald, T']","['Whiley AC', 'Price V', 'MacDonald T']","['Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Professions, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Mercaptopurine', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/10/13 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/10/12 05:19'],"['2020/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/12 05:19 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220963550 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Oct;27(7):1631-1636. doi: 10.1177/1078155220963550.

Histopathological examination is commonly used for diagnosis of the disease, but observation of lymphoma alone does not confirm EBL because cattle may be affected by sporadic forms of lymphoma that are not associated with BLV. Detection of BLV in tumor cells can be definitive evidence of EBL, but currently, there is no technique available for such a purpose. In this study, we focused on a viral non-coding RNA, AS1, and developed a novel in situ hybridization assay for the detection of BLV from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. RNA-seq analysis revealed that all examined B lymphocytes derived from clinical EBL abundantly expressed AS1 RNA, indicating a possible target for detection. The in situ hybridization assay using an AS1 probe clearly detected AS1 RNA in fetal lamb kidney cells persistently infected with BLV. The utility of this assay in clinical samples was assessed using three EBL-derived lymph node specimens and one BLV-negative specimen, and AS1 RNA was detected specifically in the EBL-derived tissues. These results suggest that AS1 RNA is a useful target for the detection of BLV from FFPE specimens of tumor tissues.

Reliable burden estimates will help guide resource allocation. This study aimed to perform a nationwide cost analysis of the direct and indirect costs of the top ten most costly cancers, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as a comparison, in Taiwan. SETTING: A population-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 545 221 patients with newly diagnosed cancer (lung cancer, female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, oral cancer, leukaemia, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer) and 170 879 patients with ACS between 2007 and 2014 were identified. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct medical costs were calculated from claims recorded in the National Health Insurance Research Database . Indirect costs, comprising morbidity-associated and mortality-associated productivity losses, were estimated from public life expectancy, average wage and employment data. The costs incurred in the 3 years after diagnosis were assessed. As a comparison, the cost of ACS was also estimated using the same study frame. A cost driver analysis was conducted to identify factors impacting cancer costs. RESULTS: The cancers with the highest mean direct medical costs and total costs were leukaemia (US$28 464) and oesophageal cancer (US$81 775), respectively. Indirect costs accounted for over 50% of the total economic burden of most cancers, except for prostate cancer and female breast cancer. The costs of ACS were lower than those of most cancers. From the cost driver analysis, older age at diagnosis significantly (p<0.05) decreased the total cost of cancer; in contrast, male, tumour metastasis, comorbidities and treatment in medical centres increased the costs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the comprehensive economic burden of the top 10 most costly cancers in Taiwan. These results are valuable for optimising healthcare resource allocation.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No', 'commercial re-use.

These disease parameters also can be indicative of long-term disease progression. The objectives of this study were to determine the timing and to describe early fluctuations of BLV-detection by qPCR, ELISA, and lymphocyte counts. Fifteen Holstein steers were experimentally inoculated with 100 muL of a blood saline inoculum. Three steers served as in-pen negative controls and were housed with the experimentally infected steers to observe the potential for contract transmission. Five additional negative controls were housed separately. Steers were followed for 147 days post-inoculation (DPI). Infections were detected in experimentally infected steers by qPCR and ELISA an average of 24- and 36 DPI, respectively. Significant differences in lymphocyte counts between experimentally infected and control steers were observed from 30 to 45 DPI. Furthermore, a wide variation in peak proviral load and establishment was observed between experimentally infected steers.

AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, the cytotoxic activity of F. officinalis extracts on two leukemia and nine multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic and ferroptotic activity were examined by resazurin reduction assay. Flow cytometry, immunoblotting assay and fluorescence microscopy were used to measure cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss integrity of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and autophagy. LC-ESI/MS was used to identify chemical constituents present in F. officinalis. RESULTS: Chloroform (CF) and ethyl acetate (EF) fractions showed drastic cytotoxic effect on CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR 5000 cells. NCI-H929 cell line exhibited higher sensitivity against CF, while EF demonstrated its higher cytotoxicity on OPM-2 cells with IC50 value 14.80 +/- 1.70 and 28.13 +/- 1.38 mug/mL respectively. Flow cytometric and morphological studies confirmed that CF and EF induced apoptosis in NCI-H929 cells by loss of MMP, generation of ROS and obvious morphological variations. In DNA histograms, up to 50% of the cells were accumulated by CF and 44% by EF in the sub-G0/G1 phase following 72 h treatment. EF induced autophagic cell death, while CF stimulated iron-dependent cell death. Moreover, two isoquinoline alkaloids and four flavonoids were identified in the active fractions. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the cytotoxicity of F. officinalis extracts in MM cell lines.

Recent large-scale retrospective studies reported that CMV reactivation is an independent risk factor for poor post-transplant outcomes, although the development of CMV end-organ disease is suppressed by the CMV antiviral preemptive therapy, which has been mainly analyzed for hematopoietic malignancies, such as acute leukemia. However, it remains unclear whether CMV reactivation also has a negative effect on post-transplant outcomes in aplastic anemia (AA). Therefore, we evaluated the clinical relevance of CMV reactivation in patients with AA using the registry database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Adult patients with AA who underwent their first allo-HSCT between 2005 and 2017 and who survived with neutrophil engraftment until 100 days post-transplantation were analyzed (n = 672). Patients were monitored using pp65 antigenemia since the time of engraftment, and CMV reactivation in the analysis of this study was defined as the beginning of CMV preemptive or definitive therapy within 100 days post-transplantation. CMV reactivation occurred in 372 (55%) patients, including 19 with CMV end-organ disease. In time-dependent multivariate analysis, patients aged >/=40 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; P = .003) who underwent transplantation from HLA-matched related peripheral blood stem cells (HR, 2.85; P = .008), HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow (BM) (HR, 2.01; P = .036), and other stem cell sources (HR, 2.32; P = .007) compared to HLA-matched related BM, CMV reactivation (HR 1.65; P = .042), grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR 1.73; P = .013), and secondary graft failure (HR 7.09; P < .001) had independent risk factors that significantly decreased overall survival, indicating that CMV reactivation, one of the early events at post-transplantation, had a significant negative impact on the long-term prognosis at post-transplantation. This effect was more pronounced in patients aged >/=40 years who received a graft from other than HLA-matched related BM. Comparing the causes of death with and without CMV reactivation, no significant difference in the frequency of each cause of death was observed between the 2 groups (P = .453). Improvement of post-transplant CMV management that effectively suppresses CMV reactivation in the early stage at post-transplantation will be required to improve post-transplant outcomes, especially in high-risk patients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using ad hoc statistical analysis, we designed a multicenter retrospective study to determine outcomes in 261 patients age </=70 years at diagnosis who underwent allo-HCT (n = 119) compared with those who did not (n = 142) according to the current CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS). Categorizing patients as lower risk (CPSS low/intermediate-1) or higher risk (intermediate-2/high) showed significantly improved outcomes after transplantation in higher-risk patients, with a 37% reduced hazard for death. However, although higher CPSS was associated with worse outcomes in the nontransplantation group, the score was of limited utility for post-transplantation risk stratification. This study may provide further support for the potentially beneficial role of allo-HCT in terms of long-term survival in higher-risk patients but also underscores the need for transplantation-specific risk assessment. Recognizing limitations of retrospective comparisons, larger and prospective comparisons are needed to further refine the indication for allo-HCT and thus counseling of patients with CMML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The recommended dose of rasburicase for the management of TLS is 0.2 mg/kg per day for 5 days, which is cost prohibitive for many patients. We sought to determine the efficacy of single low-dose rasburicase in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in TLS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We planned a prospective study for the safety and efficacy of fixed (weight based) dose of rasburicase to manage TLS. Patients diagnosed with leukemia/lymphoma with laboratory or clinically confirmed TLS or presence of >/= 2 high-risk factors and serum uric acid > 7.5 mg/dL were included. The primary endpoint was uric acid normalization (< 7.5 mg/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were recruited for this study. Pediatric patients (< 18 years) accounted for 43.6% of cases. Rasburicase was provided prophylactically to 43 patients (78.2%) and for treating TLS to 12 (21.8%). Mean +/- standard deviation serum uric acid at baseline and 24 hours was 9.2 +/- 1.8 mg/dL and 3.2 +/- 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. There was significant reduction in the serum uric acid and creatinine (P < .001) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. The response was maintained up to 72 hours. A single dose of rasburicase was effective in 94.5% of patients. Single low-dose rasburicase led to 95% direct cost savings compared to the recommended dose. CONCLUSION: Single-dose rasburicase with frequent laboratory monitoring is effective in the management of TLS and offers significant cost reductions.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of different doses of SFPS on HEL cell growth was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 method, and apoptosis was detected by Hoechst staining. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry. Expression of the cell cycle gene, p53, antiapoptotic genes, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic genes, Bax, Bad, and Caspase-3, as well as the expression of the corresponding proteins, were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. The results showed that SFPS II and III decreased HEL cell viability and induced HEL cell apoptosis. Different concentrations of SFPS (I, II, and III) were detected that induced much less toxic effect in normal human embryonic lung (MRC-5) cells, and SFPS I increased cell proliferation, indicating its favorable selectivity towards cancer cells. The mechanism by which SFPS induced apoptosis was also found to be related to the induction of cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and the increased expression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins. We concluded that SFPS induces HEL cell apoptosis, possibly via activation of the Caspase pathway, providing the theoretical basis for the development of SFPS-based anti-tumor drug products.","['Copyright (c) 2020 China Pharmaceutical University.

However, additional mechanisms and events, many of which function independently of BCR-ABL1, play important roles, particularly in terms of leukemic stem cell (LSC) persistence, primary and secondary resistance, and disease progression. Promising therapeutic approaches aim to disrupt pathways which mediate LSC survival during successful TKI treatment, in the hope of improving long-term treatment-free-remission and perhaps provide a functional cure for some patients. Over the years through advances in sequencing technology frequent molecular aberrations in addition to BCR-ABL1 have been identified not only in advanced disease but also in chronic phase CML, often affecting epigenetic regulators such as ASXL1, DNMT3A and TET2. Analyses of serial samples have revealed various patterns of clonal evolution with some mutations preceding the BCR-ABL1 acquisition.

In contrast, in other myeloid neoplasms, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma, the study must be complemented with fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or microarrays, which can overcome some of the shortcomings of banding analysis to identify potential cryptic alterations or reciprocal translocations. In the genomic era, novel technologies such as next generation sequencing are now being used in clinical routine analysis, since they offer the possibility of studying mutations and copy number alterations in a single study at a higher resolution and/or sensitivity. However, they require highly qualified staff and further standardisation, especially regarding data analysis, thereby limiting their current applicability.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are no reference data to compare these approaches, and the parameters governing tumor epitope immunogenicity remain unclear. Here, we assembled a global consortium wherein each participant predicted immunogenic epitopes from shared tumor sequencing data. 608 epitopes were subsequently assessed for T cell binding in patient-matched samples. By integrating peptide features associated with presentation and recognition, we developed a model of tumor epitope immunogenicity that filtered out 98% of non-immunogenic peptides with a precision above 0.70. Pipelines prioritizing model features had superior performance, and pipeline alterations leveraging them improved prediction performance. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 310 epitopes prioritized from tumor sequencing data and assessed for T cell binding.

Epidemiological and familial studies suggest that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing MPN, but the genetic susceptibility of MPN is still not well known. Indeed, only few loci are known to have a clear role in the predisposition to this disease. Some studies reported a diagnosis of MPNs and multiple myeloma (MM) in the same patients, but the biological causes are still unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the two diseases share at least partly the same genetic risk loci. In the context of a European multicenter study with 460 cases and 880 controls, we analyzed the effect of the known MM risk loci, individually and in a polygenic risk score (PRS). The most significant result was obtained among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for PS0RS1C1-rs2285803, which showed to be associated with an increased risk (OR = 3.28, 95% CI 1.79-6.02, P = .00012, P = .00276 when taking into account multiple testing). Additionally, the PRS showed an association with MPN risk when comparing the last with the first quartile of the PRS (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.64-3.48, P = 5.98 x 10(-6) ).

Autoimmunity may also be triggered by some of the therapeutic agents used like purine analoges and these events may sometimes be severe and even fatal. Non-hematological autoimmune stigmata occur far less frequently and are rarely encountered. Here we report a 59 year-old-woman, with CLL, who complained of recurrent headache starting 1 month after completing 6 cycles of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab combination therapy. Computed tomography scan of the brain showed a contrast enhancing lesion of 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding edema in the right frontal lobe. Brain MRI revealed ring enhancing lesions in the right frontal lobe and some additional small lesions in the left parietal lobe. Brain biopsy showed an inflammatory demyelinating lesion, not associated with JC virus. The patient subsequently improved after steroid therapy. Currently, after 2 years of follow-up, she remains in complete hematologic remission, has no neurological deficits, and is carefully followed by a team of neurologists and hematologists.

33038027,NLM,MEDLINE,20201113,20201113,1469-493X (Electronic) 1361-6137 (Linking),10,,2020 Oct 10,Prophylaxis of thromboembolism during therapy with asparaginase in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,10.1002/14651858.CD013399.pub2 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased in adults and enhanced by asparaginase-based chemotherapy, and venous thromboembolism introduces a secondary risk of treatment delay and premature discontinuation of key anti-leukaemic agents, potentially compromising survival. Yet, the trade-off between benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to asparaginase-based regimens is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for first-time symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase-based therapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. The secondary objectives were to compare the benefits and harms of different groups of primary systemic thromboprophylaxis by stratifying the main results per type of drug (heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, and blood-derived products for antithrombin substitution). SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search on 02 June 2020, with no language restrictions, including (1) electronic searches of Pubmed/MEDLINE; Embase/Ovid; Scopus/Elsevier; Web of Science Core Collection/Clarivate Analytics; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and (2) handsearches of (i) reference lists of identified studies and related reviews; (ii) clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov registry; the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry; the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and pharmaceutical manufacturers of asparaginase including Servier, Takeda, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Ohara Pharmaceuticals, and Kyowa Pharmaceuticals), and (iii) conference proceedings (from the annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology (ASH); the European Haematology Association (EHA); the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)). We conducted all searches from 1970 (the time of introduction of asparaginase in ALL treatment). We contacted the authors of relevant studies to identify any unpublished material, missing data, or information regarding ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); including quasi-randomised, controlled clinical, cross-over, and cluster-randomised trial designs) comparing any parenteral/oral preemptive anticoagulant or mechanical intervention with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or comparing two different pre-emptive anticoagulant interventions in adults aged at least 18 years with ALL treated according to asparaginase-based chemotherapy regimens. For the description of harms, non-randomised observational studies with a control group were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Using a standardised data collection form, two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each outcome using standardised tools (RoB 2.0 tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies) and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included first-time symptomatic venous thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included asymptomatic venous thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism-related mortality, adverse events (i.e. clinically relevant non-major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia for trials using heparins), and quality of life. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For non-randomised studies, we evaluated all studies (including studies judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS-I domains) in a sensitivity analysis exploring confounding. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 23 non-randomised studies that met the inclusion criteria of this review, of which 10 studies provided no outcome data for adults with ALL. We included the remaining 13 studies in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, in which we identified invalid control group definition in two studies and judged outcomes of nine studies to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS-I domains and outcomes of two studies at serious risk of bias. We did not assess the benefits of thromboprophylaxis, as no RCTs were included. In the main descriptive analysis of harms, we included two retrospective non-randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at serious risk of bias. One study evaluated antithrombin concentrates compared to no antithrombin concentrates. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.19 (intention-to-treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on venous thromboembolism-related mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94 (intention-to-treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We do not know whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and quality of life in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase-based chemotherapy, as data were insufficient. The remaining study (224 participants) evaluated prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin versus no prophylaxis. However, this study reported insufficient data regarding harms including all-cause mortality, major bleeding, venous thromboembolism-related mortality, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and quality of life. In the sensitivity analysis of harms, exploring the effect of confounding, we also included nine non-randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at critical risk of bias primarily due to uncontrolled confounding. Three studies (179 participants) evaluated the effect of antithrombin concentrates and six studies (1224 participants) evaluated the effect of prophylaxis with different types of heparins. When analysing all-cause mortality; venous thromboembolism-related mortality; and major bleeding (studies of heparin only) including all studies with extractable outcomes for each comparison (antithrombin and low-molecular-weight heparin), we observed small study sizes; few events; wide CIs crossing the line of no effect; and substantial heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots. Although the observed heterogeneity could arise through the inclusion of a small number of studies with differences in participants; interventions; and outcome assessments, the likelihood that bias due to uncontrolled confounding was the cause of heterogeneity is inevitable. Subgroup analyses were not possible due to insufficient data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We do not know from the currently available evidence, if thromboprophylaxis used for adults with ALL treated according to asparaginase-based regimens is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. The existing research on this question is solely of non-randomised design, seriously to critically confounded, and underpowered with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The studies showed that the percentage of dead leukemia cells increased with the cultivation time and concentration of Au/Pt/ZnO nanoparticles. There was observed an increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase, which suggests the stoppage of G2/M leading to cell death.

Alemtuzumab has been used as part of conditioning regimens for prophylaxis against rejection and GVHD. While the mechanism of action is well understood, the pharmacokinetics of this drug in children needed to be studied in more detail especially in the setting of ex vivo T-cell-depleted hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: Serum alemtuzumab levels were measured at various time points in 13 patients who underwent haploidentical HCT utilizing ex vivo donor T-cell depletion. Alemtuzumab was administered subcutaneously at a cumulative dose of 45 mg/m(2) from days - 13 to - 11. A one-compartmental model was used to fit the data using non-linear mixed effects modeling. RESULTS: We determined the median half-life to be 11 days. Alemtuzumab clearance increased with increasing baseline lymphocyte count (p = 0.008). Additionally, clearance increased with weight and age (p </= 0.035). AUC of alemtuzumab did not have any significant relationship with type of leukemia, overall survival, engraftment, immune reconstitution, mixed chimerism or GVHD, although the number of subjects in this pilot study was limited. CONCLUSION: Absolute lymphocyte count and body weight affect alemtuzumab clearance. We also demonstrate feasibility of body-surface area-based dosing of alemtuzumab in pediatric HCT patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of monitoring alemtuzumab serum concentrations to balance the prevention of graft rejection and GVHD with the promotion of rapid donor immune reconstitution.",,"['Bhoopalan, Senthil Velan', 'Cross, Shane J', 'Panetta, John C', 'Triplett, Brandon M']","['Bhoopalan SV', 'Cross SJ', 'Panetta JC', 'Triplett BM']","[""Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, MS 1130, Room I3305, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. brandon.triplett@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alemtuzumab/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Body Surface Area', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Half-Life', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Pilot Projects', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC7735192,,2020/10/11 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2020/10/10 12:04'],"['2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/10 12:04 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-020-04160-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-020-04160-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2020 Dec;86(6):711-717. doi: 10.1007/s00280-020-04160-7.

However, it is unclear whether the ELTS score predicts CML-related events or treatment responses. This study evaluated the predictive value of the ELTS score regarding prognosis and treatment response in patients with CML-CP. Clinical data were retrospectively obtained from patients enrolled in the CML Cooperative Study Group (CML-CSG), which included patients diagnosed with CML-CP from April 2001 to January 2016, and treated with any tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as first-line therapy. Among 342 eligible patients, the ELTS scores indicated low-, intermediate-, and high-risk in 74%, 21%, and 5% of patients, respectively. Patients with high ELTS scores had significantly higher disease-specific mortality and worse event-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Among four risk scores, including the Sokal, Hasford, EUTOS, and ELTS scores, risk stratification by the ELTS score had the highest predictive value in assessing patient prognosis, and also in treatment responses. In fact, the EUTOS and ELTS scores were able to predict the major molecular response within 12 months.

There is no treatment to prevent its occurrence, but some zinc-based therapies have been proven to help in decreasing its intensity. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zinc in OM in children with acute leukemia in the early stages of oncological treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental study evaluated OM in 2 groups (control group: conventional hospital management, and experimental group: administration of 50 mg of zinc gluconate daily plus conventional hospital management). OM severity was recorded at a two-month follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (26 in the control group and 23 in the experimental group) were included. The mean age of the patients was 11.1 +/- 2.7 years; 65.3% had a diagnosis of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The incidences of OM in the control group and the experimental group were 46.2% and 26.1%, respectively, but the difference was not significant. Based on a negative binomial regression model, females had, on average, 1.5 more days with OM (p = 0.002), and patients assigned to the experimental group had, on average, 2 less days with OM than the control group (p = 0.001). The pain score was higher in the control group (p = 0.0009), as was the mean score on the WHO scale (p = 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: Zinc facilitated a reduction in the severity and duration of OM; further studies focusing on children are needed to confirm the effects of this trace element.",,"['Gutierrez-Vargas, R', 'Villasis-Keever, M-A', 'Portilla-Robertson, J', 'Ascencio-Montiel, I-D', 'Zapata-Tarres, M']","['Gutierrez-Vargas R', 'Villasis-Keever MA', 'Portilla-Robertson J', 'Ascencio-Montiel ID', 'Zapata-Tarres M']","['Oncology Department National Institute of Pediatrics, Health Secretary Insurgentes Sur 3700-C, Insurgentes Cuicuilco Coyoacan, Mexico City, 04530 mzapatatarres@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Spain,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal,"Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal",101231694,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', '*Mucositis', '*Stomatitis/chemically induced/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Zinc']",PMC7648919,,2020/10/11 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/10/10 08:32'],"['2020/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/10 08:32 [entrez]']","['23798 [pii]', '10.4317/medoral.23798 [doi]']",epublish,Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal. 2020 Nov 1;25(6):e791-e798. doi: 10.4317/medoral.23798.,e791-e798,,20201101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are prominent components of the tumour microenvironment and play an important role in the onset and progression of solid tumours. However, little is known about their role in the development of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Using a unique mouse model of T-ALL induced by injection of EL4 T-cell lymphoma cells to syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, we report herein that ALL leads to the invasion of leukaemia-associated monocyte-derived cells (LAMs) into the bone marrow and spleen of T-ALL mice. Furthermore, we found that leukaemia cells could polarize bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) into LAMs. In turn, LAMs were able to protect leukaemia cells from drug-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therapies targeted against the TAMs by inhibiting colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) have emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that CSF-1R inhibition inhibits the viability of BMDMs, blocks LAMs polarization and reduces the abundance of LAMs in T-ALL mice. In vivo, combination treatment of CSF-1R inhibitor and vincristine (VCR) dramatically increased the survival of T-ALL mice and delayed leukaemia progression compared with VCR monotherapy. Finally, these data reinforce the role of microenvironments in leukaemia and suggest that macrophages are a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in T-ALL.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, microtubule dynamics are an important target for anticancer drugs. The inhibition of tubulin polymerization or depolymerization was previously targeted and exhibited efficacy against solid tumors. The novel small molecule PTC596 directly binds tubulin, inhibits microtubule polymerization, downregulates MCL-1, and induces p53-independent apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells. We herein investigated the efficacy of PTC-028, a structural analog of PTC596, for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PTC-028 suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in MDS cell lines. The efficacy of PTC028 in primary MDS samples was confirmed using cell proliferation assays. PTC-028 synergized with hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine and azacitidine, to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in MDS cells. Mechanistically, a treatment with PTC-028 induced G2/M arrest followed by apoptotic cell death. We also assessed the efficacy of PTC-028 in a xenograft mouse model of MDS using the MDS cell line, MDS-L, and the AkaBLI bioluminescence imaging system, which is composed of AkaLumine-HCl and Akaluc. PTC-028 prolonged the survival of mice in xenograft models. The present results suggest a chemotherapeutic strategy for MDS through the disruption of microtubule dynamics in combination with DNA hypomethylating agents.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

However, it remains unclear how VCR pharmacokinetics affects its antileukaemic efficacy. The objective of this study is to explore the VCR pharmacokinetic parameters and intracellular VCR levels in an up-front window of Ma-Spore ALL 2010 (MS2010) study. METHODS: We randomised 429 children with newly diagnosed ALL to 15-minute vs 3-hour infusion for the first dose of VCR to study if prolonging the first dose of VCR infusion improved response. In a subgroup of 115 B-ALL and 20 T-ALL patients, we performed VCR plasma (n = 135 patients) and intracellular (n = 66 patients) pharmacokinetic studies. The correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters and intracellular VCR levels with early treatment response, final outcome and ABCB1 genotypes were analysed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between 15-minute and 3-hour infusion schedules in median Day 8 peripheral or bone marrow blast response. Plasma VCR pharmacokinetic parameters did not predict outcome. However, in B-ALL, Day 33 minimal residual disease (MRD) negative patients and patients in continuous complete remission had significantly higher median intracellular VCR24h levels (P = .03 and P = .04, respectively). The median VCR24h intracellular levels were similar among the common genetic subtypes of ALL (P = .4). Patients homozygous for wild-type ABCB1 2677GG had significantly higher median intracellular VCR24h (P = .04) than 2677TT. CONCLUSION: We showed that in childhood B-ALL, the intracellular VCR24h levels in lymphoblasts affected treatment outcomes. The intracellular VCR24h level was independent of leukaemia subtype but dependent on host ABCB1 G2677T genotype.",['(c) 2020 British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Jiang, Nan', 'Wang, Lingzhi', 'Xiang, Xiaoqiang', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Chiew, Edwynn Kean Hui', 'Koo, Yok Moi', 'Lee, How Sung', 'Lin, Hai Peng', 'Tan, Ah Moy', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Kham, Shirley Kow Yin', 'Goh, Boon Cher', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng-Juh']","['Jiang N', 'Wang L', 'Xiang X', 'Li Z', 'Chiew EKH', 'Koo YM', 'Lee HS', 'Lin HP', 'Tan AM', 'Quah TC', 'Kham SKY', 'Goh BC', 'Ariffin H', 'Yeoh AE']","['VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Sime Darby Medical Centre, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.', ""Department of Paediatrics, KK Women's & Cheildren's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."", 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore."", 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'University of Malaya Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Child', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Spores', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine']",,,2020/10/11 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2020/10/10 05:36'],"['2020/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/10 05:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14596 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2021 Apr;87(4):1990-1999. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14596.

Chemotherapeutics can be used to treat leukaemia, but their pronounced killing effects to other living cells is still an issue. Active targeting to certain specific receptors in leukaemic cells is the best way to avoid damage to other living cells. Leukaemic cells can be targeted using novel nanoparticles (NPs) coated with a specific ligand, such as octreotide (OCD), to target somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), which is expressed in leukaemic cells. METHODS: Amino-PEGylated quantum dots (QDs) were chosen as model NPs. The QDs were first succinylated using succinic anhydride and then coated with OCD. The reactivity and selectivity of the formulated QDs-OCD were studied in cell lines with well-expressed SSTR2, while fluorescence was detected using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry (FACS). Conclusively, QD-OCD targeting to blood cells was studied in vivo in mice and detected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and CLSM in tissues. RESULTS: Highly stable QDs coated with OCD were prepared. FACS and CLSM showed highly definite interactions with overexpressed SSTR2 in the investigated cell lines. Moreover, the in vivo results revealed a higher concentration of QDs-OCD in blood cells. The fluorescence intensity of the QDs-OCD was highly accumulated in blood cells, while the unmodified QDs did not accumulate significantly in blood cells. CONCLUSION: The formulated novel QDs-OCD can target SSTR2 overexpressed in blood cells with great potential for treating blood cancer.",,"['Abdellatif, Ahmed A H', 'Hennig, Robert', 'Pollinger, Klaus', 'Tawfeek, Hesham M', 'Bouazzaoui, Abdellatif', 'Goepferich, Achim']","['Abdellatif AAH', 'Hennig R', 'Pollinger K', 'Tawfeek HM', 'Bouazzaoui A', 'Goepferich A']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University, Buraydah, 51452, Qassim, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. a.abdellatif@qu.edu.sa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, 71524, Egypt. a.abdellatif@qu.edu.sa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology Department, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Regensburg University, 93040, Regensburg, Germany. a.abdellatif@qu.edu.sa.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology Department, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Regensburg University, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology Department, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Regensburg University, 93040, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Assiut University, 71526 Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, P.O.

SUV39H1 is the dominant H3K9 methyltransferase in the hematopoietic system, and its expression declines with aging. However, the role of SUV39H1 via its-mediated repressive modification H3K9me3 in leukemogenesis/leukemia progression remains to be explored. We found that SUV39H1 was down-regulated in a variety of leukemias, including MLL-r AML, as compared with normal individuals. Decreased levels of Suv39h1 expression and genomic H3K9me3 occupancy were observed in LSCs from MLL-r-induced AML mouse models in comparison with that of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Suv39h1 overexpression increased leukemia latency and decreased the frequency of LSCs in MLL-r AML mouse models, while Suv39h1 knockdown accelerated disease progression with increased number of LSCs. Increased Suv39h1 expression led to the inactivation of Hoxb13 and Six1, as well as reversion of Hoxa9/Meis1 downstream target genes, which in turn decelerated leukemia progression. Interestingly, Hoxb13 expression is up-regulated in MLL-AF9-induced AML cells, while knockdown of Hoxb13 in MLL-AF9 leukemic cells significantly prolonged the survival of leukemic mice with reduced LSC frequencies. Our data revealed that SUV39H1 functions as a tumor suppressor in MLL-AF9-induced AML progression.

An expert group met in November 2019 in London to discuss recent data of paediatric as well as adult studies using paediatric regimens with regard to the best management of several key toxicities that can occur in adults treated with asparaginase including hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridaemia, thrombosis and hypersensitivity. Several recommendations were made for each one of these toxicities, with the goal of safe administration of the drug and to educate clinicians when the drug can be continued despite side effects.","['(c) Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Using functional genomics, we determine modifiers of l-asparaginase (ASNase) response and identify thiamine pyrophosphate kinase 1 as a metabolic dependency under ASNase treatment. While thiamine is generally not limiting for cell proliferation, a DNA-barcode competition assay identifies leukemia cell lines that grow suboptimally under low thiamine and are characterized by low expression of solute carrier family 19 member 2 (SLC19A2), a thiamine transporter. SLC19A2 is necessary for optimal growth and ASNase resistance, when standard medium thiamine is lowered ~100-fold to human plasma concentrations. In addition, humanizing blood thiamine content of mice through diet sensitizes SLC19A2-low leukemia cells to ASNase in vivo. Together, our work reveals that thiamine utilization is a determinant of ASNase response for some cancer cells and that oversupplying vitamins may affect therapeutic response in leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

An increasingly popular approach for creating these materials is to directly assemble engineered proteins into high-order structures, a process that often relies on sophisticated protein chemistry. Here, we present a simple approach for creating injectable, photoresponsive hydrogels via metal-directed assembly of His6-tagged proteins. The B12-dependent photoreceptor protein CarHC can complex with transition metal ions through an amino-terminal His6-tag, which can further undergo a sol-gel transition upon addition of AdoB12, leading to the formation of hydrogels with marked injectability and photodegradability. The inducible phase transitions further enabled facile encapsulation and release of cells and proteins. Injecting the Zn(2+)-coordinated gels decorated with leukemia inhibitory factor into injured mouse optic nerves led to prolonged cellular signaling and enhanced axon regeneration. This study illustrates a powerful strategy for designing injectable biomaterials.","['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Despite the well-known prognosis role of gene mutations such as NPM1 mutations of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), clinical outcomes remain heterogeneous in this subset of AML. Given the role of genomic instability in leukemogenesis, expression analysis of DNA repair genes might be relevant to sharpen prognosis evaluation in CN-AML. A publicly available gene expression profile dataset from two independent cohorts of patients with CN-AML were analyzed (GSE12417). We investigated the prognostic value of 175 genes involved in DNA repair. Among these genes, 23 were associated with a prognostic value. The prognostic information provided by these genes was summed in a DNA repair score, allowing to define a group of patients (n = 87; 53.7%) with poor median overall survival (OS) of 233 days (95% CI: 184-260). These results were confirmed in two validation cohorts. In multivariate Cox analysis, the DNA repair score, NPM1, and FLT3-ITD mutational status remained independent prognosis factors in CN-AML. Combining these parameters allowed the identification of three risk groups with different clinical outcomes in both training and validation cohorts. Combined with NPM1 and FLT3 mutational status, our GE-based DNA repair score might be used as a biomarker to predict outcomes for patients with CN-AML. DNA repair score has the potential to identify CN-AML patients whose tumor cells are dependent on specific DNA repair pathways to design new therapeutic avenues.",,"['Gabellier, Ludovic', 'Bret, Caroline', 'Bossis, Guillaume', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Moreaux, Jerome']","['Gabellier L', 'Bret C', 'Bossis G', 'Cartron G', 'Moreaux J']","[""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, University of Montpellier, 34395 Montpellier, France."", 'UFR de Medecine, University of Montpellier, 34003 Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34090 Montpellier, France.', 'UFR de Medecine, University of Montpellier, 34003 Montpellier, France.', 'CHU Montpellier, Department of Biological Hematology, 34395 Montpellier, France.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, 34395 Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34090 Montpellier, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, 75013 Paris, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, University of Montpellier, 34395 Montpellier, France."", 'UFR de Medecine, University of Montpellier, 34003 Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34090 Montpellier, France.', 'UFR de Medecine, University of Montpellier, 34003 Montpellier, France.', 'CHU Montpellier, Department of Biological Hematology, 34395 Montpellier, France.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, IGH, CNRS, University of Montpellier, 34395 Montpellier, France.', 'Institut Universitaire de France (IUF), 75005 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['PLBIO18-362 PIT-MM/Institut National du Cancer', 'PLBIO19 FATidique/Institut National du Cancer']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7599826,,2020/10/11 06:00,2020/10/11 06:01,['2020/10/10 01:01'],"['2020/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/10 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102874 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102874 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Oct 6;12(10). pii: cancers12102874. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102874.,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3349-8250', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5717-3207']",20201006,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'normal karyotype', 'precision medicine', 'risk score']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minor stereotyped subset 169 (IGHV3-48/IGLV3-21, approximately 0.2% of all cases of CLL) is related to subset 2, as it displays a highly similar variable antigen-binding site. We further explored this relationship through next-generation sequencing and crystallographic analysis of the clonotypic B-cell receptor immunoglobulin. Branching evolution of the predominant clonotype through intraclonal diversification in the context of ongoing SHM was evident in both heavy and light chain genes of both subsets. Molecular similarities between the 2 subsets were highlighted by the finding of shared SHMs within both the heavy and light chain genes in all analyzed cases at either the clonal or subclonal level. Particularly noteworthy in this respect was a ubiquitous SHM at the linker region between the variable and the constant domain of the IGLV3-21 light chains, previously reported as critical for immunoglobulin homotypic interactions underlying cell-autonomous signaling capacity. Notably, crystallographic analysis revealed that the IGLV3-21-bearing CLL subset 169 immunoglobulin retains the same geometry and contact residues for the homotypic intermolecular interaction observed in subset 2, including the SHM at the linker region, and, from a molecular standpoint, belong to a common structural mode of autologous recognition. Collectively, our findings document that stereotyped subsets 2 and 169 are very closely related, displaying shared immunoglobulin features that can be explained only in the context of shared functional selection.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gemenetzi, Katerina', 'Psomopoulos, Fotis', 'Carriles, Alejandra A', 'Gounari, Maria', 'Minici, Claudia', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Tsagiopoulou, Maria', 'Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Pasentsis, Kostas', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Sandaltzopoulos, Raphael', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Degano, Massimo', 'Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia']","['Gemenetzi K', 'Psomopoulos F', 'Carriles AA', 'Gounari M', 'Minici C', 'Plevova K', 'Sutton LA', 'Tsagiopoulou M', 'Baliakas P', 'Pasentsis K', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Sandaltzopoulos R', 'Rosenquist R', 'Davi F', 'Pospisilova S', 'Ghia P', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Degano M', 'Chatzidimitriou A']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Biocrystallography Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Biocrystallography Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, G.

Evidence suggests that metabolism of etoposide in myeloid progenitor cells is associated with translocations involved in leukemia development. Previous studies suggest halogenation at the C-2' position of etoposide reduces metabolism. Halogens were introduced into the C-2' position by electrophilic aromatic halogenation onto etoposide (ETOP, 1), podophyllotoxin (PPT, 2), and 4-dimethylepipodophyllotoxin (DMEP, 3), and to bridge the gap of knowledge regarding the activity of these metabolically stable analogs. Five halogenated analogs (6-10) were synthesized. Analogs 8-10 displayed variable ability to inhibit DNA relaxation. Analog 9 was the only analog to show concentration-dependent enhancement of Top2-mediated DNA cleavage. Dose response assay results indicated that 8 and 10 were most effective at decreasing the viability of HCT-116 and A549 cancer cell lines in culture. Flow cytometry with 8 and 10 in HCT-116 cells provide evidence of sub-G1 cell populations indicative of apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate C-2' halogenation of etoposide and its precursors, although metabolically stable, decreases overall activity relative to etoposide.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Leukemic evolution occurs rarely but has a grim prognosis. The interval between diagnosis and leukemic evolution is highly variable, from a few years to >20 years. We performed a molecular evaluation of 49 leukemic transformations of PV and ET by targeted next-generation sequencing. Using a hierarchical classification, we identified 3 molecular groups associated with a distinct time to leukemic transformation. Short-term transformations were mostly characterized by a complex molecular landscape and mutations in IDH1/2, RUNX1, and U2AF1 genes, whereas long-term transformations were associated with mutations in TP53, NRAS, and BCORL1 genes. Studying paired samples from chronic phase and transformation, we detected some mutations already present during the chronic phase, either with a significant allele burden (short-term transformation) or with a very low allele burden (especially TP53 mutations). However, other mutations were not detected even 1 year before leukemic transformation.

Yield of genetic testing and phenotypic spectra for TBDs caused by the expanding list of telomere genes in adults remain understudied. Thus, we screened adults aged >/=18 years with a personal and/or family history clustering hematologic disorders and/or ILD enrolled on The University of Chicago Inherited Hematologic Disorders Registry for causative variants in 13 TBD genes. Sixteen (10%) of 153 probands carried causative variants distributed among TERT (n = 6), TERC (n = 4), PARN (n = 5), or RTEL1 (n = 1), of which 19% were copy number variants. The highest yield (9 of 22 [41%]) was in families with mixed hematologic and ILD presentations, suggesting that ILD in hematology populations and hematologic abnormalities in ILD populations warrant TBD genetic testing. Four (3%) of 117 familial hematologic disorder families without ILD carried TBD variants, making TBD second to only DDX41 in frequency for genetic diagnoses in this population. Phenotypes of 17 carriers with heterozygous PARN variants included 4 (24%) with hematologic abnormalities, 67% with lymphocyte telomere lengths measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization at or above the 10th percentile, and a high penetrance for ILD.

The objective of this research is to develop new statistical methods in detecting and analyzing both differentially expressed and spliced isoforms, which appropriately account for the dependence between isoforms and multiple testing corrections for the multi-dimensional structure of at both the gene- and isoform- level. We developed a linear mixed effects model-based approach for analyzing the complex alternative RNA splicing regulation patterns detected by whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing technologies. This approach thoroughly characterizes and differentiates three types of genes related to alternative RNA splicing events with distinct differential expression/splicing patterns. We applied the concept of appropriately controlling for the gene-level overall false discovery rate (OFDR) in this multi-dimensional alternative RNA splicing analysis utilizing a two-step hierarchical hypothesis testing framework. In the initial screening test we identify genes that have differentially expressed or spliced isoforms; in the subsequent confirmatory testing stage we examine only the isoforms for genes that have passed the screening tests. Comparisons with other methods through application to a whole transcriptome RNA-Seq study of adenoid cystic carcinoma and extensive simulation studies have demonstrated the advantages and improved performances of our method. Our proposed method appropriately controls the gene-level OFDR, maintains statistical power, and is flexible to incorporate advanced experimental designs.",,"['Luo, Li', 'Kang, Huining', 'Li, Xichen', 'Ness, Scott A', 'Stidley, Christine A']","['Luo L', 'Kang H', 'Li X', 'Ness SA', 'Stidley CA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA170250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE023222/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Algorithms', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Linear Models', 'Models, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",PMC7546511,['NO authors have competing interests'],2020/10/10 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/10/09 17:08'],"['2020/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/09 17:08 [entrez]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0232646 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-11155 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Oct 9;15(10):e0232646. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0232646. eCollection 2020.,e0232646,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4415-3573'],20201009,,,,['Dryad/10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k0h'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, PTCy alone has resulted in inferior outcomes in matched sibling donor (MSD) employing peripheral blood (PB) SCTs. We hypothesized that adding thymoglobulin to PTCy would be able to control GvHD effectively. We retrospectively compared the use of standard GvHD prophylaxis encompassing a combination of PTCy and thymoglobulin (ATG) in patients with myeloid malignancies in a myeloablative conditioning MSD PBSCT. Forty-two patients underwent PBSCT using either methotrexate and cyclosporine (MTX/CSA, 21 patients) or PTCy and ATG (21 patients) as a GvHD prophylaxis. With median follow-ups of 71 months, the 1-year GvHD-free, relapse-free survival rates and chronic GvHD-free survival rate of the standard and PTCy/ATG groups were similar: 24% versus 37% (P = 0.251) and 29% versus 43% (P = 0.095), respectively. When focusing on chronic GvHD we observed that 17/35 patients (48.6%) suffered from this, 5/18 (27.8%) treated with MTX/CSA had extensive chronic GvHD, but 0/17 PTCy/ATG did. Twenty-one patients required additional GvHD treatment; 7/21 in the PTCy/ATG received only corticosteroid, while 8/14 MTX/CSA required at least 2 drugs. The 5-year overall survival rates were 52% and 52% (P = 0.859), and the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 52% and 52% (P = 0.862) for the MTX/CSA and PTCy/ATG groups, respectively.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for driving the onset and development of this pathology are not clear yet. Vacuolar demyelination seems to be one of the most significant histopathological observations of ADLD. Considering the role of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-activated signaling pathways in the myelination processes, this work aims to analyze the specific alterations in different cell populations from patients with LMNB1 duplications and engineered cellular models overexpressing Lamin B1 protein. Our results point out, for the first time, that astrocytes may be pivotal in the evolution of the disease. Indeed, cells from ADLD patients and astrocytes overexpressing LMNB1 show severe ultrastructural nuclear alterations, not present in oligodendrocytes overexpressing LMNB1. Moreover, the accumulation of Lamin B1 in astrocytes induces a reduction in LIF and in LIF-Receptor (LIF-R) levels with a consequential decrease in LIF secretion. Therefore, in both our cellular models, Jak/Stat3 and PI3K/Akt axes, downstream of LIF/LIF-R, are downregulated. Significantly, the administration of exogenous LIF can partially reverse the toxic effects induced by Lamin B1 accumulation with differences between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, highlighting that LMNB1 overexpression drastically affects astrocytic function reducing their fundamental support to oligodendrocytes in the myelination process. In addition, inflammation has also been investigated, showing an increased activation in ADLD patients' cells.",,"['Ratti, Stefano', 'Rusciano, Isabella', 'Mongiorgi, Sara', 'Owusu Obeng, Eric', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Teti, Gabriella', 'Falconi, Mirella', 'Talozzi, Lia', 'Capellari, Sabina', 'Bartoletti-Stella, Anna', 'Guaraldi, Pietro', 'Cortelli, Pietro', 'Suh, Pann-Ghill', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Ramazzotti, Giulia']","['Ratti S', 'Rusciano I', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Owusu Obeng E', 'Cappellini A', 'Teti G', 'Falconi M', 'Talozzi L', 'Capellari S', 'Bartoletti-Stella A', 'Guaraldi P', 'Cortelli P', 'Suh PG', 'Cocco L', 'Manzoli L', 'Ramazzotti G']","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, Bologna, Italy.', 'Functional MR Unit, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, UOC NeuroMet, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, UOC NeuroMet, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, UOC NeuroMet, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, UOC NeuroMet, Bologna, Italy.', 'Korea Brain Research Institute, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, UNIST, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. lucio.cocco@unibo.it.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. lucia.manzoli@unibo.it.', 'Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (lamin B1)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Astrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Demyelinating Diseases/metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Lamin Type B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC8004488,,2020/10/10 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/10/09 12:10'],"['2020/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/09 12:10 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00018-020-03661-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-020-03661-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2021 Mar;78(6):2781-2795. doi: 10.1007/s00018-020-03661-1.

We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry to evaluate patterns in ALL incidence from 2000 to 2016, including the association between percentage of people born in a foreign country at the county level and ALL incidence. Among 23,829 persons of all ages diagnosed with ALL, 8,297 (34.8%) were Latinos, 11,714 (49.2%) were non-Latino (NL) Whites, and 1,639 (6.9%) were NL Blacks. Latinos had the largest increase in the age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of ALL during this period compared with other races/ethnicities for both children and adults: The AAIR was 1.6 times higher for Latinos (AAIR = 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.37, 2.49) than for NL Whites (AAIR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.53, 1.59) (P < 0.01). The AAIR for all subjects increased approximately 1% per year from 2000 to 2016 (annual percent change = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.67, 1.27), with the highest increase being observed in Latinos (annual percent change = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.60). In multivariable models evaluating the contribution of percentage of county residents who were foreign-born to ALL risk, a positive association was found for percentage foreign-born for NL Whites (P for trend < 0.01) and NL Blacks (P for trend < 0.01), but the reverse was found for Latinos (P for trend < 0.01); this is consistent with tenets of the ""Hispanic paradox,"" in which better health outcomes exist for foreign-born Latinos.","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Therefore, the development of selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors is an attractive strategy for the treatment of CML. However, in the treatment of CML with a Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor, the T315I gatekeeper mutant disrupts the important contact interaction between the inhibitor and the enzyme, resistant to the first- and second-generation drugs currently approved, such as imatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. In order to overcome this special resistance, several different strategies have been explored, and many molecules have been studied to effectively inhibit Bcr-Abl T315I.

We studied the epidemiologic and clinical features of patients with CML diagnosed at younger than 3 years of age and evaluated treatment and long-term outcome. METHOD: Data from the International Pediatric I-BFM/CML Registry were retrospectively analyzed using the European LeukemiaNet criteria of the year 2006. Characteristics and treatment outcome of patients <3 years old at diagnosis were evaluated from standardized forms. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (n = 22/479; 4.6%, male/female:14/8) were enrolled with a median age of 22 months (range, 10-34 m). Major symptoms comprised asthenia (30%), fever (30%), abdominal pain (20%), extramedullary signs (14%), hemorrhage (5%), and weight loss (5%). The extramedullary signs were specified in eight children: blueberry muffin (n = 1), sudden swollen abdomen (n = 1), sustained vomiting (n = 1), and cervical and inguinal lymph nodes (n = 5). Two of five children with cervical and inguinal lymph nodes were categorized as accelerated phase. Overall, 19 of 22 (86%) children were diagnosed in chronic phase, while the remaining three patients were in advanced phase. Median follow-up was 78 months (range, 7-196 m). Twenty-one out of 22 patients initially received imatinib, while one child received IFN + ARA-C. Imatinib was changed to second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 29% of cases. During follow-up, 41% patients underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT). While on TKI, major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 48% of children. Among the remaining patients, 21% are alive on TKI without MMR and 22% achieved complete molecular response following SCT. Twenty-one of 22 (95%) children are alive, while one patient died of posttransplant complications.

However, PCa inevitably relapses and becomes ADT resistant. Besides androgens, there is evidence that thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and its active form 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) are involved in the progression of PCa. Epidemiologic evidences show a higher incidence of PCa in men with elevated thyroid hormone levels. The thyroid hormone binding protein mu-Crystallin (CRYM) mediates intracellular thyroid hormone action by sequestering T3 and blocks its binding to cognate receptors (TRalpha/TRbeta) in target tissues. We show in our study that low CRYM expression levels in PCa patients are associated with early biochemical recurrence and poor prognosis. Moreover, we found a disease stage-specific expression of CRYM in PCa. CRYM counteracted thyroid and androgen signaling and blocked intracellular choline uptake. CRYM inversely correlated with [18F]fluoromethylcholine (FMC) levels in positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging of PCa patients. Our data suggest CRYM as a novel antagonist of T3- and androgen-mediated signaling in PCa. The role of CRYM could therefore be an essential control mechanism for the prevention of aggressive PCa growth.","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

In genetically engineered mouse models, Notch1 acts as one of the first steps to commit basal keratinocytes to terminally differentiate. Similarly, in human head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs), NOTCH1 is often lost consistent with its essential tumor-suppressive role for initiating keratinocyte differentiation. However, constitutive NOTCH1 activity in the epithelium results in expansion of the spinous keratinocyte layers and impaired terminal differentiation is consistent with the role of NOTCH1 as an oncogene in other cancers, especially in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We have previously observed that NOTCH1 plays a dual role as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene, depending on the mutational context of the tumor. Namely, gain or loss or NOTCH1 activity promotes the development of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. The additional HPV oncogenes likely disrupt the tumor-suppressive activities of NOTCH and enable the oncogenic pathways activated by NOTCH to promote tumor growth.

In the absence of a Notch signal, RBPJ remains at Notch target genes and dampens transcriptional output. Like in other signaling pathways, RBPJ is able to switch from activation to repression by associating with corepressor complexes containing several chromatin-modifying enzymes. Here, we focus on the recent advances concerning RBPJ-corepressor functions, especially in regard to chromatin regulation. We put this into the context of one of the best-studied model systems for Notch, blood cell development. Alterations in the RBPJ-corepressor functions can contribute to the development of leukemia, especially in the case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

The data confirm the existence of two distinct interaction sites within the PBC domain of PBX1 and unravel differences among the highly similar binding sites of MEIS1 and PREP1. The HR2 domain has a fundamental role in binding the PBC-B domain of PBX1 in both PREP1 and MEIS1. The HR1 domain of MEIS1, however, seem to play a less stringent role in PBX1 interaction with respect to that of PREP1. This difference is also reflected by the different binding affinity of the two proteins to PBX1.

Because their expression is exclusive to cancer cells and their elimination induces cell apoptosis in FO-driven cancers, FOs are attractive therapeutic targets. However, specifically targeting the resulting chimeric products is challenging. Based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology, here we devise a simple, efficient and non-patient-specific gene-editing strategy through targeting of two introns of the genes involved in the rearrangement, allowing for robust disruption of the FO specifically in cancer cells. As a proof-of-concept of its potential, we demonstrate the efficacy of intron-based targeting of transcription factors or tyrosine kinase FOs in reducing tumor burden/mortality in in vivo models.

METHODS: The efficacy of acalabrutinib from ELEVATE-TN (study of Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil, Acalabrutinib [ACP-196] + Obinutuzumab, and Acalabrutinib in Subjects With Previously Untreated CLL) was compared to bendamustine + rituximab, chlorambucil-based therapy, alemtuzumab, ibrutinib mono/combination therapy and venetoclax + obinutuzumab using data from eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Relevant RCTs were identified using a systematic literature review. Two evidence networks were constructed: Network A, composed solely of RCTs that met the inclusion criteria; and Network B, composed of 7 RCTs and a published cross-trial comparison of ibrutinib from RESONATE-2 and chlorambucil + obinutuzumab from iLLUMINATE. Bayesian NMAs were conducted on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) endpoints; results were reported by using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs). HRs were considered significant if their CrIs did not cross 1. Treatments were ranked by using the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) values. Expert opinion from 2 hematologists was sought to validate results. FINDINGS: Both networks showed a significant improvement in PFS for acalabrutinib + obinutuzumab over all comparators. Both networks also showed a significant improvement in PFS for acalabrutinib monotherapy versus most comparators, with a significant difference to ibrutinib monotherapy found in Network A but not Network B. Conversely, a significant difference in PFS was observed for acalabrutinib monotherapy versus venetoclax + obinutuzumab in Network B but not Network A. Although OS HRs all favored acalabrutinib, most were not significant and were characterized by wide CrIs, indicating a high level of uncertainty. Acalabrutinib + obinutuzumab ranked highest in terms of PFS improvement (SUCRA values, 98% and 100%) and OS improvement (SUCRA values, 92% and 94%), followed by acalabrutinib monotherapy (SUCRA values for PFS, 88% and 90%; OS, 83% and 87%) in Networks A and B, respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Acalabrutinib was associated with favorable PFS and OS compared with frontline CLL therapies and ranked highest in treatment efficacy over the other comparators. The NMA was limited by heterogeneity in patient baseline characteristics across trials, variable treatment regimens, and short study follow-up times. Despite these limitations, the NMA provides insights into the relative efficacy of acalabrutinib compared with frontline CLL therapies in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

We evaluated the 1-year cost-effectiveness of TKI initiation with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib among a hypothetical cohort of incident patients with CML from a US payer's perspective. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model to assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, net monetary benefit, and incremental cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. We used published studies and data from the IBM Watson Health MarketScan database for model parameters. To calculate TKI costs, we used the 2018 Federal Supply Schedule estimates for generic imatinib and branded second-generation TKIs. We evaluated cost-effectiveness under various willingness-to-pay thresholds. We accounted for uncertainty with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, imatinib was favored over dasatinib and nilotinib at a lower cost per QALY gained. Imatinib remained the favored strategy after 1-way variations in TKI costs, TKI switching, QALYs, adverse event risk, and CML progression. When we assessed model uncertainty with prespecified parameter distributions, imatinib was cost-saving compared with dasatinib in 40% of 100 0000 simulations and was favored over all simulations compared with nilotinib. First-line treatment with second-generation TKIs was cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a $200 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Generic availability of imatinib provides a more cost-effective treatment approach in the first year compared with other available TKIs for newly diagnosed patients with CML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 ISPOR-The Professional Society for Health Economics and', 'Outcomes Research.

Patients with hematologic malignancies typically are known to have higher levels of immunosuppression and may develop more severe respiratory viral infections than patients with solid tumors. Data on COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies are limited. Here we characterize disease severity and mortality and evaluate potential prognostic factors for mortality. METHODS: In this population-based registry study, we collected de-identified data on clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within the Madrid region of Spain. Our case series included all patients admitted to 22 regional health service hospitals and 5 private healthcare centers between February 28 and May 25, 2020. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. We assessed the association between mortality and potential prognostic factors using Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, hematologic malignancy and recent active cancer therapy. RESULTS: Of 833 patients reported, 697 were included in the analyses. Median age was 72 years (IQR 60-79), 413 (60%) patients were male and 479 (69%) and 218 (31%) had lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, respectively. Clinical severity of COVID-19 was severe/critical in 429 (62%) patients. At data cutoff, 230 (33%) patients had died. Age >/= 60 years (hazard ratios 3.17-10.1 vs < 50 years), > 2 comorbidities (1.41 vs </= 2), acute myeloid leukemia (2.22 vs non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and active antineoplastic treatment with monoclonal antibodies (2.02) were associated with increased mortality; conventional chemotherapy showed borderline significance (1.50 vs no active therapy). Conversely, Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (0.33) and active treatment with hypomethylating agents (0.47) were associated with lower mortality. Overall, 574 (82%) patients received antiviral therapy. Mortality with severe/critical COVID-19 was higher with no therapy vs any antiviral combination therapy (2.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19, mortality was associated with higher age, more comorbidities, type of hematological malignancy and type of antineoplastic therapy.

In addition, the shared and distinct microbiome features among complex human diseases remain largely unclear. RESULTS: This analysis was based on a Chinese population with 1475 participants. We estimated the SNP-based heritability, which suggested that Desulfovibrionaceae and Odoribacter had significant heritability estimates (0.456 and 0.476, respectively). We performed a microbiome genome-wide association study to identify host genetic variants associated with the gut microbiome. We then conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses to examine the potential causal associations between the gut microbiome and complex human diseases. We found that Saccharibacteria could potentially decrease the concentration of serum creatinine and increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer, as predicted by host genetics, had potential causal effects on the abundance of some specific gut microbiota. For example, atrial fibrillation increased the abundance of Burkholderiales and Alcaligenaceae and decreased the abundance of Lachnobacterium, Bacteroides coprophilus, Barnesiellaceae, an undefined genus in the family Veillonellaceae and Mitsuokella. Further disease-microbiome feature analysis suggested that systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic myeloid leukaemia shared common gut microbiome features. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that different complex human diseases share common and distinct gut microbiome features, which may help reshape our understanding of disease aetiology in humans.

However, > 85% of patients treated were prior FLT3i naive. The response rates to sequential FLT3i exposure remain poorly defined. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with FLT3-mutated AML between November 2006 and December 2019. RESULTS: In frontline patients treated with a FLT3i (cohort 1), the CRc rates and median overall survival (OS) with the first (n = 56), second (n = 32), and third FLT3i-based (n = 8) therapy were 77%, 31%, and 25%, and 16.7 months, 6.0 months, and 1.4 months, respectively. In patients receiving a FLT3i-based therapy for the first time in a R/R AML setting (cohort 2), the CRc rates and median OS were 45%, 21%, and 10%, and 7.9 months, 4.0 months, and 4.1 months with the first (n = 183), second (n = 89), and third/fourth (n = 29) FLT3i-based therapy, respectively. In cohort 1, CRc rates with single-agent FLT3i (n = 21) versus FLT3i-based combinations (n = 19) in second/third sequential FLT3i exposures were 19% versus 42%, respectively. In cohort 2, the CRc rates with single-agent FLT3i (n = 82) versus FLT3i-based combinations (n = 101) in first FLT3i exposure were 34% versus 53%, respectively, and those with single-agent FLT3i (n = 63) versus FLT3i-based combinations (n = 55) in second/third/fourth sequential FLT3i exposures were 13% versus 25%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CRc rates drop progressively with sequential exposure to FLT3i's in FLT3-mutated AML. In all settings, CRc rates were higher with FLT3i-based combinations compared with single-agent FLT3i therapy in similar FLT3i exposure settings.",,"['Yilmaz, Musa', 'Alfayez, Mansour', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Ghayas, Issa', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Assi, Rita', 'Alotaibi, Ahmad S', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Daver, Naval G']","['Yilmaz M', 'Alfayez M', 'DiNardo CD', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia TM', 'Konopleva MY', 'Loghavi S', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Patel KP', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Pierce SA', 'Ghayas I', 'Short NJ', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Takahashi K', 'Assi R', 'Alotaibi AS', 'Ohanian M', 'Andreeff M', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Ravandi F', 'Daver NG']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit FC4.2012, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.
